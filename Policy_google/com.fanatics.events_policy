If you do not agree to be bound by these terms of use, you may not access or use the Properties.

Using the Properties in a manner inconsistent with any applicable law, rule or regulation.
5. FanCash.
FanCash is a loyalty discount redeemable only toward future purchases on the Properties or, at our discretion, certain other websites operated by us or one of our affiliates. When you make a purchase, no additional consideration is required from you to obtain FanCash but in order to obtain FanCash, you must create and maintain a customer account registered with a valid email address and check out while logged into that account on one of the websites, which is then offering FanCash. To earn and redeem FanCash you must create and maintain a customer account registered with a valid email address and check out while logged into that account on one of our websites which is then offering FanCash. If you check out as a guest, you will not earn or be able to redeem FanCash even if you have an account. Registered users logged into their accounts at checkout will automatically earn one (1%) percent  FanCash on all eligible merchandise purchases and have any existing balance applied as a discount on their eligible merchandise purchase. All merchandise (including sale and promotional items) is eligible for earning FanCash, excluding gift cards. If you return merchandise for which you earned FanCash, that FanCash will be deducted from your FanCash balance. When you login to your account, you may view your FanCash balance (which will be applied automatically toward the next purchase) and you will also be able to see which websites are currently offering FanCash. Unless required by law, FanCash is not redeemable for cash, and cannot be transferred, sold or distributed to others and cannot be applied to shipping, expenses or sales taxes. You will receive periodic emails about your FanCash balances and program news or promotions. FanCash expires as follows: FanCash expires at 11:59 PM EST three hundred sixty-five (365) days (i.e., one (1) year) from the date of your last eligible purchase or other qualifying transaction, unless otherwise specified at the time of earning and specifically excluding bonus FanCash. Subsequent eligible purchases or other qualifying transactions will extend the expiration date for all earned FanCash in your account (the “Extended FanCash”); provided, however, if you have been awarded bonus FanCash with an earlier expiration date, we will specify the expiration date at the time of earning and such bonus FanCash will not qualify as Extended FanCash (and thus will not qualify for the extended expiration date). By way of an example, if you earned $10.00 in FanCash on an eligible purchase made on a FanCash Platform on January 1, 2024, and you make another eligible purchase on a FanCash Platform on December 31, 2024, then the expiration date for your initial $10.00 in earned FanCash will be extended to 11:59 PM EST on December 31, 2025. We reserve the right to discontinue FanCash or modify the terms applicable to FanCash at any time. FanCash is a registered trademark of Fanatics.

If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we will refund any such charges within a commercially reasonable period of time after cancellation (the time it takes for your financial institution to process the refund may vary and is governed by your agreement with them).
9. Placing an Order; Limitations; Order Acceptance.

22. Arbitration; No Class Action.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. Use or accessing the Properties or Offers constitutes your acceptance of this Arbitration provision.
As a condition of using the Properties, you and we agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action (collectively, "Claims") arising out of or connected with the Properties (except for small claims court Claims, if applicable) shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, for full and final settlement of such Claim applying the Federal Arbitration Act and other federal arbitration laws. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO SUE OR GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT. YOU AND WE ALSO AGREE THAT (A) ANY CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, MEMBER OF OTHERWISE ON BEHALF OF OTHERS IN ANY PURPOSED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND NOT THROUGH ANY CLASS ACTION, (B) IF A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT ANYWAY, WE BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL; AND (C) EITHER YOU OR WE MAY SEEK A COURT INJUNCTION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.  ARBITRATION DOES NOT INVOLVE A JUDGE OR JURY.  Although court review of an arbitration award may be limited, an arbitrator is empowered to award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive relief or statutory damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek temporary or emergency equitable relief to enforce its rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You may seek arbitration of a Claim by contacting our registered agent at: Corporation Service Company, 1201 Hays Street, Tallahassee, FL 32301. The arbitration may be conducted via telephone, written submissions or in person in a mutually agreed location. Payment of all filing, administration, arbitrator and/or mediator fees ("Fees") will be governed by AAA's rules. The AAA's rules are available at:
www.adr.org
or call 800-778-7879 (toll-free) for instructions on how to obtain a copy.  Unless the AAA arbitrator determines that your Claim was frivolous, we will (i) reimburse you for the Fees paid by you, and (ii) will not seek reimbursement from you for our attorneys' fees and costs associated with the arbitration.  You and we further agree that an award and any judgment confirming it only applies to the arbitration in which it was awarded and cannot be used in any other proceeding except to enforce the award itself and any post-arbitration action seeking to enforce an arbitration award or action seeking equitable or injunctive relief shall be brought exclusively in the courts of the State of Delaware, or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration, if any: (a) the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within the State of Delaware (the "Forum"), and the parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and we waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.

These Terms of Use, together with any additional terms and conditions or policies referred to and incorporated herein (including the Privacy Policy and/or additional terms applicable to various parts of the Properties), constitute the entire understanding between you and us. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms of Use apply solely to the extent permitted by law.

*Each offer has a limited duration that expires at the specified time. Some promotions may require that you enter a code. By making a purchase featuring a discount or promotion, including where a code may be required, you are agreeing to these terms and exclusions. Generally, eligibility will be as reflected in the price shown on the product page. However, discounts and promotions for certain products may only appear once an item is added to the cart and the code is entered. Prices and fees, including any applicable discount(s), will be as reflected in the cart. Only the as-discounted retail price (excluding applicable shipping, taxes, and handling fees) counts toward any minimum spend required for eligibility. If a rewards program applies, the rewards may only apply to the as-discounted retail price. Discounts and promotions do not apply to gift cards. Gift card purchases do not count toward any minimum spend required for eligibility. Exclusions may apply, including: all auctions and product drops; product that is already on sale, of limited quantity, for recent championship or other special events; trading cards and certain memorabilia; select jerseys, on-field headwear, die cast and certain collectibles; and certain premium brand product. Additional terms and other exclusions may apply in our sole discretion. Free shipping promotions are valid in Continental U.S., US Territories, and AFO/FPO only, such promotions exclude heavy, large, and/or bulky items, and free shipping does not apply to the extent your cart at checkout contains any excluded item(s).

i.
Cookies

    computer hard drive, pixels, web beacons, and tags are embedded invisibly on
    web pages.
iii.
Session replay tools
,
    which record your interactions with our Properties, such as how you move
    throughout our Properties and engage with our webforms. In addition to the uses
    described below, this information helps us improve our Properties and identify
    and fix technical issues visitors may be having with our Properties.

Embedded
        scripts, custom links and SDKs
,
    which allow us to build and integrate custom apps and experiences, some of
    which may be developed by a third party.
a.
Purposes
        for Using These Technologies
We and authorized third parties use these
    technologies for purposes including:
i.
Personalization

    time to better understand your preferences and interests; and personalizing
    online content;

, such asmaintaining and improving the
    performance of our Properties and Services;

    we use Google Analytics to help us improve our Properties, performance and user
    experiences. Google Analytics may use
    cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. To
    learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners
; and
iv.
Advertising
, suchas providing you with offers that may be of interest
    to you; conducting targeted advertising to you on our Properties and those of
    third parties; and measuring the effectiveness of our communications with you
    and advertising campaigns, including identifying how and when you engage with
    our communications.
b.

    data about you and your device, such as your IP address, location (both
    approximate and precise), cookie ID, device ID, AdID, operating system, browser
    used, browser history and referrers, search history, and information about how
    you interact with our Properties (such as pages on our Properties that you have
    viewed).
c.
Disclosures
        of Your Information
We may disclose information to third
    parties or allow third parties to directly collect information using these
    technologies on our Properties, such as social media companies, advertising
    networks, companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting,
    security providers, infrastructure service providers (such as to reduce delays
    and increase efficiency of the Properties based on your location), and others
    that help us operate our business and Properties.
d.
Your
        Choices
Some of the third parties we work
    with participate with the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network
    Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). The DAA and NAI provide mechanisms for you to
    opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
and
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
.
    You may also click on the AboutAds icon on advertisements and follow the
    instructions on how to opt out.
You
    can also refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings. If you
    refuse or delete cookies, some of our Properties’ functionality may be
    impaired. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about
    how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies. If you
    change computers, devices, or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or
    browsers; or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each
    computer, device, or browser. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not
    opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from
    us or our agents or representatives.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”)
    preferences. At this time, we do not honor Do Not Track signals. Some
    browsers have incorporated Global Privacy Controls (“GPC.”) When a compliant
    signal is detected by the Properties, we honor GPC controls.

    contracts, or for other legitimate business purposes, such as to enable easier
    future user onboarding, demonstrate our business practices and contractual
    obligations, or provide you with information about our products and services in
    case of interest.

        Your Choices
We strive to offer you with choices about how your personal
    information is used and disclosed.
    Some of the ways in which you may exercise these choices are described
    below.
a.
Opting Out of Our Services
.
i.
    Email:
    you can unsubscribe from commercial emails using the unsubscribe link,
    typically at the bottom of the e-mail. If
    you have an account with us, you may opt-out of some or all future unsolicited
    commercial communications by updating your account’s personal information
    settings (where available).
ii.
    SMS: If you have provided your mobile
    phone number and we have separately obtained your consent to participate in our
    SMS marketing campaigns on behalf of our ourselves or our affiliated entities,
    you may opt out by responding to a message with the keyword STOP.
iii.
    Referral: If you participate
    in our referral program, the friend you referred may contact us using the
    information in the Contact Us section of this policy to opt out of future
    communications from us.
iv.
    Mobile: On most devices, mobile
    application users may opt out of mobile communications from us via their device
    settings (mobile browser cookies require a separate opt-out, as explained
    below).
In addition, you may request that we delete
    your personal information by emailing your request to the email address in the
    Contact Us section, and we will process your request within a reasonable time
    after receipt, subject to our rights under the Data Retention section
    above. To exercise your privacy rights
    with respect to personal information held by Business Partners, please visit
    the Business Partners’ website(s).
b.
Direct Marketing Opt-Out
. If you do not want your personal information
    disclosed to any third party who may use such information for direct marketing
    purposes, then you may opt-out of such disclosures by sending an email to the
    email address in the Contact Us section.
    However, we are not responsible for removing your personal information
    from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your
    information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and any elections or
    privacy choices you may make with respect to receipt of certain types of
    e-mails or marketing communications from us will not apply to any such third
    parties. You should contact any third
    parties that send you communications directly with respect to choices that they
    may make available to you with respect to such communications.
c.
Setting Cookie Preferences
. Most web browsers can be set to detect or
    reject cookies. Each browser is
    different, so check the “Help” or “Settings” menu of your browser settings to
    learn how to change your cookie preferences.
    If you reject cookies, some features on our websites may not work
    properly. Cookie-based opt-outs must be
    performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.
d.
Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising
. To provide you with more relevant and
    interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads
    or customize the content on the website and on other websites. Some of these
    third parties may participate in DAA NAI programs, which provide mechanisms for
    you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members
    at
www.aboutads.info
and
optout.networkadvertising.org
.
    Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all
    advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents
    or representatives.
e.
Location Data Opt-Out.
In some cases, you may also adjust the
    settings on your personal device or mobile device to allow or restrict the
    sharing of location information. For
    example, the "location" permissions on your personal device or mobile
    device may allow you to elect whether to never share location information with
    us, to share location information only while you are using the Services or
    always share location information even if you are not using the Services. If you elect to not share your location
    information, you may be unable to access some features of our Services that are
    designed for mobile devices or that require us to confirm your location. Also, in the event that you prevent the
    sharing of location information, we may still estimate your general location
    based on the IP address you use to access our Services.
f.
Account Modification
: If you have a Fanatics account, you may be able access, update, delete,
    or correct your personal information by logging into your account.
g.
Push
        Notifications
. We also may enable our
    mobile application to offer automatic (or “push”) notifications. We will provide push notifications only to
    those users who permit such notifications.
    If you would like to opt-out of push notifications, you can do so using
    your mobile device settings.
10.
        Security of Your Personal Information
We use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality
    of the personal information submitted to us both during transmission and after
    we receive it.
11.
        Children’s Privacy
We are committed to the preservation of online privacy for all of
    our visitors, including children. We
    provide products and provide services intended for adults (i.e., those age 18
    or older, or 21 in some jurisdictions).
    If you make a purchase on our Services, you are representing that you
    are an adult. We will not knowingly
    collect any personal information from children under the age of 18 without the
    consent of that child's parent or guardian.
    If you are not 18 or older, you are not authorized to use the
    Services. If we become aware that
    personal information from a child under 18 has been collected, we will use all
    reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. If any parent, guardian or other responsible
    adult becomes aware that we have collected personal information from a child
    under the age of 18, please contact us using the information in the Contact Us
    section.

    you interact with our Properties (such as pages on our Properties that you have

c.
Disclosures
        of Your Information
We may disclose information to third
    parties or allow third parties to directly collect information using these
    technologies on our Properties, such as social media companies, advertising
    networks, companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting,

Your
        Choices
Some of the third parties we work
    with participate with the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network
    Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). The DAA and NAI provide mechanisms for you to
    opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
and
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
.
    You may also click on the AboutAds icon on advertisements and follow the
    instructions on how to opt out.
You
    can also refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings. If you
    refuse or delete cookies, some of our Properties’ functionality may be
    impaired. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about
    how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies. If you
    change computers, devices, or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or
    browsers; or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each
    computer, device, or browser. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not
    opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from
    us or our agents or representatives.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”)
    preferences. At this time, we do not honor Do Not Track signals. Some
    browsers have incorporated Global Privacy Controls (“GPC.”) When a compliant
    signal is detected by the Properties, we honor GPC controls.
7.
        Data Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary
    to fulfill the purposes we have outlined above unless we are required to do
    otherwise by applicable law. This
    includes retaining your personal information to provide you with the products
    or services you have requested and interact with you; maintain our business
    relationship with you; improve our business over time; ensure the ongoing
    legality, safety and security of our Services and relationships; or otherwise
    in accordance with our internal retention procedures. Once you have terminated your relationship
    with us, we may retain your personal information in our systems and records in
    order to ensure adequate fulfillment of surviving provisions in terminated
    contracts, or for other legitimate business purposes, such as to enable easier
    future user onboarding, demonstrate our business practices and contractual
    obligations, or provide you with information about our products and services in
    case of interest.
8.
        Third-Party Websites and Social Media Services
a.
Third-Party Websites
. The Services may contain links to other
    websites or Internet resources. When you
    click on one of those links, you are contacting another website or Internet
    resource. We have no responsibility or
    liability for, or control over, those other websites or resources or their
    collection, use and disclosure of your information, and this Privacy Policy
    does not apply to personal information collected through those websites or
    resources. We suggest that you read the
    privacy policy and terms of use of each such website.
b.
Social Media, Widgets and Open Forums
. Our Services may allow you to engage with
    social media services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram
    ("Social Networks"), and widgets such as the "Share this"
    button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Services or which link
    from Social Networks to our Services ("Social Functions"),
    potentially including identity and messaging functions run by these
    networks. These Social Functions may
    access, collect, and integrate with your Social Network accounts and
    information. For example, these Social
    Functions may collect your IP address, identify which page you are visiting on
    our Services, or set a cookie. Social
    Functions may also be used to register you as a Services user. If you choose to use these Social
    Functions, you may be sharing certain Social Network profile elements with us,
    including your name, birthday (month/day), comments, contacts, email address,
    photos, or favorite teams.
This sharing is subject to each Social Network's own privacy policy and
    terms of use. We do not control those
    Social Networks or your profiles on those services, nor do we modify your
    privacy settings on those services or establish rules about how your personal
    information on those services will be used.
    Please refer to the privacy settings in your Social Network account to
    manage the data that is shared with us through your account.
Information
    you include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, or
    Social Network, or that you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel
    or survey, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We do not control such uses of your personal
    information, and by using such services you assume the risk and acknowledge
    that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by us
    and/or third parties for any number of purposes and that the usage restrictions
    set forth in this Privacy Policy do not apply to such services. To request removal of your personal
    information from a blog, community forum or other publicly accessible part of
    the Services, contact us using the information in the Contact Us section. In some cases, we may not be able to remove
    your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable
    to do so.
9.
        Your Choices
We strive to offer you with choices about how your personal
    information is used and disclosed.
    Some of the ways in which you may exercise these choices are described
    below.
a.
Opting Out of Our Services
.
i.
    Email:
    you can unsubscribe from commercial emails using the unsubscribe link,
    typically at the bottom of the e-mail. If
    you have an account with us, you may opt-out of some or all future unsolicited
    commercial communications by updating your account’s personal information
    settings (where available).
ii.
    SMS: If you have provided your mobile
    phone number and we have separately obtained your consent to participate in our
    SMS marketing campaigns on behalf of our ourselves or our affiliated entities,
    you may opt out by responding to a message with the keyword STOP.
iii.
    Referral: If you participate
    in our referral program, the friend you referred may contact us using the
    information in the Contact Us section of this policy to opt out of future
    communications from us.
iv.
    Mobile: On most devices, mobile
    application users may opt out of mobile communications from us via their device
    settings (mobile browser cookies require a separate opt-out, as explained
    below).
In addition, you may request that we delete
    your personal information by emailing your request to the email address in the
    Contact Us section, and we will process your request within a reasonable time
    after receipt, subject to our rights under the Data Retention section
    above. To exercise your privacy rights
    with respect to personal information held by Business Partners, please visit
    the Business Partners’ website(s).
b.
Direct Marketing Opt-Out
. If you do not want your personal information
    disclosed to any third party who may use such information for direct marketing
    purposes, then you may opt-out of such disclosures by sending an email to the
    email address in the Contact Us section.
    However, we are not responsible for removing your personal information
    from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your
    information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and any elections or
    privacy choices you may make with respect to receipt of certain types of
    e-mails or marketing communications from us will not apply to any such third
    parties. You should contact any third
    parties that send you communications directly with respect to choices that they
    may make available to you with respect to such communications.
c.
Setting Cookie Preferences
. Most web browsers can be set to detect or
    reject cookies. Each browser is
    different, so check the “Help” or “Settings” menu of your browser settings to
    learn how to change your cookie preferences.
    If you reject cookies, some features on our websites may not work
    properly. Cookie-based opt-outs must be
    performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.
d.
Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising
. To provide you with more relevant and
    interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads
    or customize the content on the website and on other websites. Some of these
    third parties may participate in DAA NAI programs, which provide mechanisms for
    you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members
    at
www.aboutads.info
and
optout.networkadvertising.org
.
    Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all
    advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents
    or representatives.
e.
Location Data Opt-Out.
In some cases, you may also adjust the
    settings on your personal device or mobile device to allow or restrict the
    sharing of location information. For
    example, the "location" permissions on your personal device or mobile
    device may allow you to elect whether to never share location information with
    us, to share location information only while you are using the Services or
    always share location information even if you are not using the Services. If you elect to not share your location
    information, you may be unable to access some features of our Services that are
    designed for mobile devices or that require us to confirm your location. Also, in the event that you prevent the
    sharing of location information, we may still estimate your general location
    based on the IP address you use to access our Services.
f.
Account Modification
: If you have a Fanatics account, you may be able access, update, delete,
    or correct your personal information by logging into your account.
g.
Push
        Notifications
. We also may enable our
    mobile application to offer automatic (or “push”) notifications. We will provide push notifications only to
    those users who permit such notifications.
    If you would like to opt-out of push notifications, you can do so using
    your mobile device settings.
10.
        Security of Your Personal Information
We use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality
    of the personal information submitted to us both during transmission and after
    we receive it.
11.
        Children’s Privacy

    our visitors, including children. We
    provide products and provide services intended for adults (i.e., those age 18
    or older, or 21 in some jurisdictions).
    If you make a purchase on our Services, you are representing that you
    are an adult. We will not knowingly
    collect any personal information from children under the age of 18 without the
    consent of that child's parent or guardian.
    If you are not 18 or older, you are not authorized to use the
    Services. If we become aware that
    personal information from a child under 18 has been collected, we will use all
    reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. If any parent, guardian or other responsible
    adult becomes aware that we have collected personal information from a child
    under the age of 18, please contact us using the information in the Contact Us
    section.
