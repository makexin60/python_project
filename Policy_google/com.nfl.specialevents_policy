You may exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your cookie-based personal information by visiting "Privacy Settings" in applicable apps or the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer of applicable websites and toggling off Selling, Sharing, Targeted Advertising cookies.

For more information on how the GPC works, visit their website
here
. Because the GPC is browser-based, note that your choices will be tied to online data that is associated with your browser, and you should enable the signal separately for each browser and/or device from which you would like to be opted out. Our websites do not support "do-not-track" signals, as there is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
Note that we do not knowingly sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you. We may verify certain types of requests by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Authorized agents may exercise rights on your behalf using the same mechanisms described herein, but we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.
We reserve the right to deny requests as allowed by applicable law, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent, where your identity cannot be confirmed, or where the NFL must retain your information consistent with applicable law. You can, however, appeal those requests that we deny by submitting a request
here

14. NFL Events
Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which a fan mobile pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event.

Legal Basis for Data Processing: We process personal information for the specific purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, as described above. Where such concept is recognized, our legal basis to process personal information includes:
Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract: When you enter into a transaction with us, we will need to collect, process, and share your personal information. Failure to provide the requisite personal information when entering into such an agreement, objecting to this type of processing, and/or exercising your deletion rights may mean that products and/or services cannot be provided to you.
Legitimate interest: In certain circumstances we may use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own, but this is provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. This is on the basis of our legitimate interest to:
o provide you with information and services as requested by you on a non-contractual basis;

o communicate with you and manage our relationship with you;
o administer our websites and applications;

We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal information for achieving our legitimate interests, as outlined above, as:
o We process your personal information only so far as is necessary to achieve the purpose outlined in this Privacy Notice; and
o The processing of your personal information does not unreasonably intrude on your privacy and ultimately benefits you in optimizing our provision of services to you.
Consent: We may, on occasion and where permitted by law, process your personal information based on your consent. For example, where required by law, we will obtain consent to collect and process your sensitive personal information or to send you marketing messages by email. You may opt out of receiving certain marketing messages by exercising the choices described in
Communications and Geolocation Preferences
.
To the extent our processing is based on consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. However, please note that the withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Compliance with legal obligations: To meet our regulatory and legal obligations, we may need to process some of your personal information.
In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal information for processing, as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our Services and for you to use all the features of our website.
If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected.

Note that we do not knowingly sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you. We may verify certain types of requests by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Authorized agents may exercise rights on your behalf using the same mechanisms described herein, but we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.
We reserve the right to deny requests as allowed by applicable law, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent, where your identity cannot be confirmed, or where the NFL must retain your information consistent with applicable law. You can, however, appeal those requests that we deny by submitting a request

14. NFL Events
Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which a fan mobile pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event. You should therefore expect to be filmed or photographed by CCTV and/or by cameras when you are in a public location at an NFL Event (e.g., as an audience-member in the stadium if you are attending a game). In addition to describing how we capture and use your image, voice and/or likeness in this Privacy Notice, we may also display signs at any NFL Event indicating that you may be filmed or photographed.
We may use your personal information collected at an NFL Event:
To produce, exhibit, advertise or otherwise use your image, voice, or likeness in any and all media now or existing in future as part of NFL's commercial, advertising and marketing activities; and
In the case of images or footage captured on CCTV cameras, to ensure the safety of the venues hosting NFL Events and of individuals attending NFL Events.
Sharing your personal information from an NFL Event: We may disclose your personal information captured at an NFL Event with any of the entities set out in this Privacy Notice, as described in
Disclosure of Information
. Additionally, when you appear in a photograph or film footage at an NFL Event, we may disclose that photograph or film footage containing your image, voice, and/or likeness with our third-party partners. These partners include our sponsors, licensees, advertisers, and/or broadcasters. We will disclose the photographs or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so. However, each of the third-party partners may use your personal information for their independent commercial purposes without reference to the NFL.
Please also note that broadcasters and other third parties that are unconnected to the NFL may be independently filming or photographing you when you attend an NFL Event. Although we only give permission to a small group of entities (such as certain broadcasters) to film or photograph NFL Events, these entities are separate data controllers in respect of your personal information, and the NFL is not responsible for how those parties use your personal information and for what purposes.

18. International Users
This section of the Privacy Notice is supplemental and provides disclosures in addition to those made elsewhere in this Privacy Notice. This supplemental section applies only if you attend an event outside of the United States or use our website or Services otherwise covered by this Privacy Notice from a country that is not the United States, and where the applicable member of the NFL Family is subject to jurisdiction-specific laws.
NFL Enterprises LLC is the data controller for League processing of personal information when you use our website and mobile applications. NFL International LLC is the data controller for League processing of personal information collected when you attend an NFL Event outside of the United States. Member Clubs may also be a data controller for certain club specific executions, and their entities are listed
here
.
Legal Basis for Data Processing: We process personal information for the specific purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, as described above. Where such concept is recognized, our legal basis to process personal information includes:
Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract: When you enter into a transaction with us, we will need to collect, process, and share your personal information. Failure to provide the requisite personal information when entering into such an agreement, objecting to this type of processing, and/or exercising your deletion rights may mean that products and/or services cannot be provided to you.
Legitimate interest: In certain circumstances we may use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own, but this is provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. This is on the basis of our legitimate interest to:
o provide you with information and services as requested by you on a non-contractual basis;
o develop and improve our services to you and to our other customers;
o communicate with you and manage our relationship with you;
o administer our websites and applications;
o carry out management analysis, audit, forecasts, business planning, and transactions;
o ensure our compliance with applicable laws, regulatory requirements, and our policies; and
o deal with legal claims and related administrative activities.
We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal information for achieving our legitimate interests, as outlined above, as:
o We process your personal information only so far as is necessary to achieve the purpose outlined in this Privacy Notice; and
o The processing of your personal information does not unreasonably intrude on your privacy and ultimately benefits you in optimizing our provision of services to you.
Consent: We may, on occasion and where permitted by law, process your personal information based on your consent. For example, where required by law, we will obtain consent to collect and process your sensitive personal information or to send you marketing messages by email. You may opt out of receiving certain marketing messages by exercising the choices described in
Communications and Geolocation Preferences
.
To the extent our processing is based on consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. However, please note that the withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Compliance with legal obligations: To meet our regulatory and legal obligations, we may need to process some of your personal information.
In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal information for processing, as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our Services and for you to use all the features of our website.
If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected. You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes applicable law.
Except as otherwise prescribed by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the English language version and local language version of this Privacy Notice, the English language version will prevail.

Digital measurement
privacy
notice - US
Effective Date: December 2024
Nielsen ("
Nielsen
", "
we
", or "
us
") is committed to protecting consumer privacy and processing personal data in an open and transparent manner. This Digital Measurement Privacy Notice ("
Notice
") covers the collection, use, and disclosure of data collected via our proprietary software and digital technologies in order to provide digital measurement services to our clients. These services measure and analyze how consumers engage with media online, across websites, mobile apps and devices, and enable Nielsen to offer research insights into consumer online behavior. The practices described in this Privacy Notice are undertaken by Nielsen companies providing digital measurement services around the world. Learn more about Nielsen's group of companies
here
.
This Privacy Notice reflects our general digital measurement practices. However, our contracts with clients may place limits on what we can or cannot do with data collected when we provide such digital measurement services to them. In some cases, we may not be permitted to use and share data in all of the ways described in this Privacy Notice. When our contract with a client only permits us to process data to provide the client with services, we typically do so as a "service provider" or “data processor”. When our contract with a client permits us to process data for purposes other than providing services to the client, we may do so as a "business" or "data controller".
Please review the privacy notices of website publishers and other parties whose websites and applications you use for specific information about their use of data collected on those websites and applications, including through their use of our digital measurement services. We require our clients to let their users know about the use of measurement products and software (although they may not always identify Nielsen by name), ensure they have obtained appropriate permissions to collect, use, and disclose to us data collected as a result of their use of the our digital measurement services; and ensure users are given appropriate choices with respect to the collection and use of their data.
A. Data collection
Nielsen works with various companies, including , advertisers, agencies and publishers, to measure the effectiveness and reach of online content viewed or listened to, regardless of the device used to consume it. For example, we help advertisers better understand campaign performances across television, computer and mobile device audiences.
How Data is Collected:
Our clients include Nielsen's proprietary measurement software in their content on their chosen sites, advertisements, mobile apps, video players, and other internet-connected devices (such as smart TVs). Alternatively, they may provide us data directly through connections to their servers or other secure data transfer methods. In this Privacy Notice the word "content" refers to audio, video, advertisements and any other media users might encounter or engage with online. Nielsen's measurement software is embedded in the content or via the devices that you use in order to gather information that helps us understand what content users are exposed to and interact with, and which advertising campaigns are effective.
The specific data collected depends on how our clients use our measurement software but a description of the data we can collect is provided below. We do not identify, or attempt to identify individuals from the data collected:
Desktop:
IP address, cookie ID, hashed email address, browser type, language, and referring website addresses.
Mobile Device:
IP address, Cookie ID, hashed email address, device type and model, mobile Advertising identifiers, operating system
Connected TV:
IP address, cookie ID, hashed email address, browser type, language, and referring website addresses.
We also collect information about the content that was viewed – such as the ad campaign, program or episode as well as information about where the content was viewed – such as the website or the app.
We do not track or collect information about users' activities across sites or applications. Data we collect may be matched with data from Nielsen panelists or other companies that recognize their own users or that collect data about consumers generally, such as social media companies or ecommerce companies. Data from these other sources is used to enhance or calibrate the data collected from our measurement software, and to enable more robust research and analyses. These companies provide Nielsen with aggregated audience statistics (such as age and gender make-up of an audience) which does not include data that could directly identify an individual.
In some cases, we collect information directly from individuals. Occasionally, Nielsen presents short surveys to users who may or may not have been exposed to our clients' content. Responses are voluntary, and the surveys do not ask for or collect any directly identifiable data.
B. Data use
We process personal data to provide our digital measurement services to clients. This enables the creation of research insights, reports, and analyses of consumer online behavior including the composition of the audience that viewed certain content or about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign, such as an audience measurement report finding that an ad campaign was viewed by "70,000 females between the ages 24-30 in the U.S., Pacific Northwest region."
We use tools and methods to make sure that there is no reasonable possibility of identifying users from the reports and insights we create and provide to our clients. The data we collect from users is combined with the data collected from other sources to produce aggregated reports from which users cannot be uniquely identified; if it is not aggregated, we take steps to make sure there is no reasonable possibility of re-identification.
In addition to processing personal information for our digital measurement services and research purposes as described above, we process personal information to:
Operate and manage our IT and security systems, including to monitor such systems and identify and respond to security events;
Detect and prevent fraud;
Conduct research for quality assurance and product, service, and business development purposes, including research and development. This includes data analysis, audits, developing new products, producing predictive models, improving our services, identifying usage trends, and determining the effectiveness of our communications;
Facilitate the day-to-day operations and financial management of the Nielsen group of companies and any corporate transactions (e.g., re-organization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, etc);
Protect the rights, safety, property, or operations of one or more Nielsen entities, you, or others;
