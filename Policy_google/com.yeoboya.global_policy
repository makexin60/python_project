The company utilizes third-party providers that support a variety of tasks, including hosting and maintenance of data for operation and marketing, analytics, customer service, marketing, advertising, and operational enhancement.

6. User rights
The company hopes that users can freely manage their own information. We would like to remind you of the settings and features available to users.
- Access and update within the service: Users can use the features and account settings to access, modify, and delete information provided to the service and directly related to their user accounts.
- Device permissions: Mobile devices have systems that allow users to allow or deny specific types of device data collection, such as photos, location services, push notifications, and advertising identifiers. Users can change the settings on their devices to agree or refuse to collect such information or display such notifications. However, changing settings may result in the loss of some services' full functionality.
- Application deletion: Users can delete applications and stop collecting all information through the deletion process on the device they are using. Please note that deleting the application does not delete the user's account.
- Account deletion: Users can use the account deletion feature in the service app to delete their account immediately.

The company hopes that users understand their rights to privacy. Depending on the user's country of residence, they may have the following rights:
- Deletion: Users can request that the company delete their personal information that it holds. Users can directly submit a request to the company to exercise their right to deletion.
- Modification/Change/Update: Users can modify their profiles within the service to update most of their personal information. If any of the user's personal information registered with the company is incorrect, they may contact the company to correct it.
- Refusal/Limitation: Users have the right to request that the company refuse or limit the processing of specific information. In order to protect all users, the company may ask for identification verification before responding to these requests. However, if the user's identity cannot be confirmed, or if the request is illegal or incorrect, or if the request infringes on the company's trade secrets, intellectual property rights, personal information protection, or the rights of other users, the company may refuse the request. If a user requests information related to another member (such as message history), the company can only provide the information if the member submits written consent to the company and the company may also request identification verification. Additionally, the company may not be able to accept certain requests to refuse or limit the processing of personal information. For example, if a user's date of birth is not available and the minimum age requirement (18 years old) for the service cannot be confirmed, the company may not be able to provide the service.
If the company refuses a user's request for privacy protection who is a resident of Virginia, USA, the user may contact the company directly to file a complaint. If there is concern about the outcome of the complaint, the user should contact the legal department of the relevant state.

7. User Information Retention Period
The company will only retain users' personal information for the period deemed necessary for legitimate business purposes (refer to section 4) and as permitted by relevant laws. If the user wishes to stop using the service, deleting their account will result in their profile no longer being displayed to other members. Please note that if there is no user activity detected for one year, the account will be automatically deleted. When an account is deleted, the user's personal information will also be deleted. Please refer to the details below for more information.

A. For the safety and security of service members, a safety grace period of 3 months after account deletion or 1 year after account suspension will be enforced. During this period, the company will retain user information in case illegal or harmful acts need to be investigated, and this retention of information during the safety grace period is based on the legitimate interests of the company and potential third-party victims.

B. After the safety grace period has expired, the company will delete user information and only retain limited information for specific purposes as follows:
1) The company will retain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations. The consent records submitted by members to the company will be retained for 5 years to prove the company's compliance with relevant laws.
2) The company will retain limited information for legitimate interests. Customer support team records and supporting data on downloads and approximate location information will be retained for 5 years to support customer support team decision-making, strengthen the company's rights, and defend the company in the event of litigation.

Information about past accounts will be retained for 3 years after the user deletes their last account and will then be finally deleted by the company. Profile data will be retained for 1 year if potential litigation is expected in order to establish, exercise, or defend legal rights. Data necessary for managing members who have been banned from creating new accounts due to misconduct will be retained until it is deemed necessary for the safety and significant interests of other service members.
3) The company will retain information for its legitimate interests in case of unresolved or potential problems, litigation, or disputes that require data retention.
