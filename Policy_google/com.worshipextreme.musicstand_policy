This Privacy Policy explains how WorshipTools (collectively “
the Company
,
” “
we
,” or “
us
”) collects, uses, and discloses information about you. This Privacy Policy applies when you use our websites, mobile applications, platforms, products, and services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our “
Platform
”), purchase our products, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
The information we collect from you varies depending on the way you use our Platform. When you browse our public website to explore our Platform to learn more about us or purchase our products online (“
Website Visitor
”), the information we collect and use is different from the information we collect if you are a business owner or agent acting on behalf of a business (“
Business Owner
”) or if you are a songwriter, creator, music user, or publisher (collectively, “
Platform User
”). Below, we describe the different ways we might collect information from you.

Website Visitors
If you are a Website Visitor, you may share information directly with us when you sign up for our newsletter, fill out a form, application, or questionnaire, purchase merchandise, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of personal information we may collect include your name, business and personal email address, address, phone number, and any other information you choose to provide.

Any other information you submit in connection with our Platform

Business number
FCC ID number
We may also collect information that a Business Owner chooses to provide relating to its clients or individuals that it serves. The Company does not directly collect or control this information, but rather, Business Owners determine what information they collect, and to the extent the Company receives that information, we do so on behalf of our Business Owners. Please review the applicable Business Owner’s privacy policy for disclosures about how they collect, use, and process information.
If you make a purchase from us, we engage third-party payment processors to collect and process your payment information.

This information is used to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES
The Company is located in the United States and has operations and service providers in the United States and other countries. Therefore, we and our service providers process data in the United States and may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide similar levels of data protection. Where required by law, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal information in accordance with applicable law, such as by obtaining your consent, relying on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions, executing Standard Contractual Clauses, or complying with another approved data transfer mechanism. Where relevant, you may request a copy of these Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing us at support@worshiptools.com.
DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK
The Company participates in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, “
DPF
”) issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission, UK Information Commissioner’s Office, and the Swiss Data Federal Data Protection Commission. The Company commits to comply with the DPF Principles with respect to personal information the company receives from the EU, UK, and Switzerland in reliance on the DPF.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov. To view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search.
If third-party agents process personal information on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any damages. If you have a question or complaint related to our compliance with the DPF Principles, please contact us as described in the
Contact Us
section below.
For any complaints related to DPF that cannot be resolved with us directly, you may refer the matter to JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Data Privacy Framework Program, which is described on the JAMS website at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework. JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the JAMS rules. Following the dispute resolution process, the mediator or the consumer may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has DPF investigatory and enforcement powers over the Company. Under limited circumstances, and after other available dispute resolution mechanisms have been exhausted, consumers may be able to invoke binding arbitration to address complaints about the Company’s compliance with the DPF Principles.
