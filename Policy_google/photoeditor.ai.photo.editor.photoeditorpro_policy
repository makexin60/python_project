Privacy Policy
Last Updated: August 9, 2023
Welcome to our app (referred to as "the app," "the Service," "we," "us," "our," or "AIFoto"). We highly value your privacy and the protection of your personal information. We are committed to complying with applicable laws and regulations to ensure the security of your personal information. Before using this app, please take some time to carefully read and understand this Privacy Policy. This policy will provide detailed information on how we collect, use, and store your information, as well as the measures we take to safeguard your personal information.
App Permissions:
Permission for Accessing Files:
To enhance your photo editing experience, we require your permission to access your local media. This will enable us to select images from your device for editing and save edited photos back to your local media storage. Please note that we only need these access permissions to complete the photo editing and saving process. We never collect any videos or photos, nor do we make any modifications or deletions to the contents of your local media storage. Your photos and media content will be treated with complete confidentiality and security.
Collecting and Using Information:
When utilizing the AI cartoon function, the app uploads your facial image to our server for the purpose of applying effects or generating a cartoon representation. In this process, facial recognition technology is employed to identify faces within photos and camera interactions. By detecting facial markers, we offer facial recognition content and the ability to manipulate facial features, specifically by applying filters to appropriate facial areas. This data is processed in real-time to enable the app's functionality. It's crucial to highlight that we do not employ this information to identify specific individuals. Rest assured, we do not automatically access or gather your image data without your consent. Furthermore, these uploaded images will be automatically deleted from our server after a period of 3 days to safeguard your privacy.
While utilizing the beauty function, the app conducts real-time processing based on the facial area within the image. Notably, your facial data is exclusively processed locally on your device and promptly vanishes upon exiting the function. In simpler terms, we do not collect or store any facial data regarding users, so that people in images cannot be uniquely identified or verified.
We do not automatically gather any personally identifiable information about you while you engage with our Services. The sole instance in which we might access your personally identifiable information is if you opt to personally email us feedback or provide a bug report. In such circumstances, we will solely acquire personally identifiable information strictly confined to your name, email address, and survey responses. Be assured that this personally identifiable information will be solely employed for communication purposes and the enhancement of our services.
In order to enhance the performance of our services, our app does indeed utilize third-party services. These services may collect certain information, including data that could potentially be used to identify you. However, please be aware that we do not have control over these third-party services and therefore cannot be held responsible for their actions.
To gain a better understanding of the privacy policies and data handling practices of these third-party services, you can refer to the specific information provided by these service providers through the following links:

We encourage you to exercise caution while using our app, especially when interacting with third-party services. Please fully comprehend and consider your own privacy rights and security concerns.
Log Data:
We passively record your interactions with our Services, which is called "Log Data." Whether visiting a website, logging into a service, or browsing content, these interactions generate data, including navigation location, IP address, browser settings, date and time of visit, search terms, commonly used elements, device data, and cookie data.
This log data not only supports us in operating the service, maintaining security and reliability but also helps optimize the service. Log data is collected and stored on the device each time it is used, including device name, operating system version, app settings, date of use, and statistics. This data helps understand app usage patterns and performance, troubleshoot issues, and continuously improve the user experience. Note that without providing feedback via email or submitting a bug report, log data remains on the device and is not transferred elsewhere.
Account Information:
Our apps currently do not require an account login, so you do not need to provide or store any personal information related to your account. You can directly access and use all functions of the app without creating an account or submitting personally identifiable information.
Cookies:
Our app does not use cookies. We prioritize your privacy which is why we have deliberately refrained from using cookies within our app. However, it's important to note that certain third-party codes and libraries used in the app may employ cookies to enhance their services. You have the option to choose whether to accept or disable these cookies in your device settings. Please be aware that disabling these cookies might impact some of the app's features.
Security and Privacy:
The security of user personal information is of paramount importance to us. We are committed to protecting your personal information by implementing a range of industry-standard security measures to foster your trust in us. It's important to note that while we employ multiple security measures, the inherent nature of the internet prevents us from guaranteeing absolute security for all information transmission or storage.
Links to Other Websites:
Our services may contain links to third-party websites, provided solely for user convenience. When you click on these links, you will be leaving our platform. It is important to be aware that we have no control over the privacy practices of these external websites, and we strongly recommend that you carefully review their privacy policies before accessing them. We do not assume responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or actions of other websites.
Protecting Children's Privacy:
Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have unintentionally collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take immediate steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor and believe that your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so that we can promptly address the situation.
In summary, our objective is to safeguard your personal information and ensure your confidence in our services. We will continue to strive towards implementing appropriate measures to protect your privacy. If you have any questions or require further insight into our privacy practices, please don't hesitate to contact us.
