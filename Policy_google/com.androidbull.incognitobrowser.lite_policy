While the data broker industry has historically operated with little regulation, there is a growing movement to enact laws that protect consumer privacy and give individuals more control over their personal information. Here are some key privacy laws and initiatives that aim to regulate data brokers:
State Privacy Laws:
California Consumer Privacy Act (
CCPA
):
This landmark law gives California residents the right to know what personal information businesses collect about them, the right to delete that information, and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.
Colorado Privacy Act (CPA):
Similar to the CCPA, this law provides Colorado residents with data privacy rights, including the right to access, correct, and delete their personal information.
Other State Laws:
Several other states have enacted or are considering data privacy laws that may provide similar protections.
Federal Legislation:
American Data Privacy and Protection Act (
ADPPA
):
This proposed federal law aims to create a comprehensive national framework for data privacy, including provisions that would regulate data brokers.
FTC Enforcement:
Section 5 of the FTC Act:
The FTC has used its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to take action against data brokers for deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition.
Your Rights:
These laws and initiatives provide you with several rights regarding your personal information:
Right to Access:
You have the right to request access to the personal information that data brokers have collected about you.
Right to Correction:
You have the right to request that data brokers correct any inaccuracies in your personal information.
Right to Deletion:
You have the right to request that data brokers delete your personal information.
Right to Opt Out:
You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information.
Exercising Your Rights:
To exercise your rights, you can contact data brokers directly and request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information. You can also opt out of data broker lists through their websites or by using third-party opt-out services.
It’s important to stay informed about your rights and the laws that protect your privacy. By exercising your rights, you can help hold data brokers accountable and ensure that your personal information is handled responsibly.
