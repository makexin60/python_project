service, we need to know who the other party is and, if you use paid features, we also need to know your payment information.
Please note that under the contract you may receive emails with technical and operational notices regarding the

Smartlook.com
service contract. Such emails do not constitute ‚Äúdirect marketing‚Äù as it is mentioned in point 2 below, and you may not opt-out of them.
The legal basis for processing in this case is
Art. 6(1)(b)
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (‚ÄúGeneral Data Protection Regulation‚Äù).

. We will not detect your IP address at any other time when you access Smartlook.com.
The legal basis for processing in this case is our legitimate interest under Art. 6(1)(f) of General Data Protection Regulation which consists of securing suitable communication between us and also performance of a contract to which you are a party under Art. 6(1)(b). As you agreed with our terms and conditions, we are committed to providing services, including support (Art. 4 of terms and conditions), for this reason we need to process the above-mentioned information. Thus, we may record your activity and use other tools, because it is necessary for the purposes of providing an information society service that is specifically requested by you.
We will only process these personal data as long as your user account exists. Furthermore, we delete individual track recordings concerning your activity and your behavior at
Smartlook.com
after 360 days at all times.
In all cases, we will process your personal data in electronic information systems. However, these systems are subject to consistent and ongoing physical and technical checks.
