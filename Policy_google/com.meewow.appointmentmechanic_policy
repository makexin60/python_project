Why We Process Your Personal Information

MeeWow Games may collect identifiable information from your game service to coordinate your use of the Services and may collect your email address if you send feedback or request support. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, you may not use the Services.

When you use a mobile platform to access the Services, we may collect and record certain information such as your unique device ID, hardware type, media access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), the version of your operating system (“OS”), and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address).
