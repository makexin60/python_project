You can find more information about how to exercise these rights in the section above entitled “Rights Specific to European Union Residents.”
The LGPD requires us to have legal bases to collect, use, share and otherwise process information about you. You can find a description of the legal bases we rely on by reviewing the above section entitled  “Our Legal Basis for Collecting Personal Data.”

Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;
Comply with a legal obligation; or
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

Your Ad Choices
As described above, we or third party partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser when you visit our Sites for the purpose of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising” or “interest-based advertising”). You may find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make, including opt-out of having your information used for internet-based advertising, through the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at the
NAI Service
, and the
Digital Advertising Alliance
(the “DAA”) at the
DAA consumer choice service
. Wahoo Fitness is a participant in the online industry’s self-regulatory program administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA’s principles applicable to interest-based ads.
The tools provided at the
DAA opt-out page
and the
NAI opt-out page
are provided by third parties, not Wahoo Fitness. Wahoo Fitness does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
Third Party Links
The Sites and Services may contain links to web pages operated by parties other than Wahoo Fitness. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Site or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects, and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party's website. Wahoo Fitness strongly recommends that each User review the third party's terms and policies.
International Transfer
Wahoo Fitness is a global company with its headquarters located in the United States. Sharing data across borders may be essential in the performance of the Services which we provide, and as a result, your Personal Information may be collected, transferred to and stored by us and our affiliates outside your jurisdiction, including outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and in countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and that may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction.
We will, subject to applicable law, rely upon legally permitted data transfer mechanisms in order to transfer, process and store your Personal Information in a jurisdiction outside of your home jurisdiction. We will ensure that the recipient of your Personal Information offers an adequate level of data protection and security.
We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have put in place commercially reasonable technical and organizational procedures to safeguard the information and Personal Information we collect on the Sites.
How We Protect Personal Data
Wahoo Fitness maintains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the User's Personal Information against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context, and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms. For example, we restrict access to personal information to Wahoo Fitness employees, contractors, business partners and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and Secure Socket Layer software (SSL) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data.
If Wahoo Fitness collects account information for payment or credit, Wahoo Fitness will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered.
Children
Our website is not intended for children under 16 years of age. We do not intentionally gather Personal information about visitors who are under the age of 16. If a child has provided us with Personal Information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us to have the information deleted from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 16 in the applicable jurisdiction, please contact us at privacy@wahoofitness.com. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a child under 16, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
Direct Marketing and “Do Not Track” Signals
Wahoo Fitness does not track its users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to allow you to opt out of data collection through those technologies.
California residents are entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed Personal Data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Under the California “Shine the Light” law, California residents may opt-out of our disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Data with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request to privacy@wahoofitness.com. California users may request further information about our compliance with this law by contacting us at privacy@wahoofitness.com or by writing to us at the address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section.
FINANCING AND EXTENDED WARRANTY PROGRAMS
In order to be able to offer you payment and extended warranty options, we will pass to third parties Klarna, Affirm, and Extend certain of your Personal Data, such as contact information and order details, in order for Klarna, Affirm, and Extend to assess whether you qualify for their payment and extended warranty options and to tailor their options for you.
Your personal data is handled in accordance with applicable data protection law and in accordance with the information in Klarna’s, Affirm’s, and Extend’s privacy policies applicable to your jurisdiction.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services or programs, email notification of privacy policy changes).

In each circumstance, we will weigh the necessity of our processing for the purpose listed against your privacy and confidentiality interests, including taking into account your reasonable expectations, the impact of processing, and any safeguards which are or could be put in place. In all circumstances, we will limit such processing for our legitimate business interest to what is necessary for its purposes.
Your Failure to Provide Personal Information
Your provision of Personal Information is required in order to use certain parts of our services and our programs. If you fail to provide such Personal Information, you may not be able to access and use our Services and/or our programs, or parts of our Services and/or our programs.
Our Retention of Your Personal Information
With respect to any Personal Information that is necessary to provide the Services to you and others, we will retain such information as long as it is necessary to provide the Services to you and others, subject to any legal obligations to further retain such information. For the sake of clarity, information associated with your account, such as your purchase history, customer support history, workout history and profile, is necessary to provide the Services to you and will be kept until you request that your account be deleted. Personal Information you provide that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide the Services may be de-identified or aggregated with other non-personal data to provide insights into the use of our Services. Additionally, we may retain some Personal Information as necessary to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce Wahoo’s Terms of Service, and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Sharing Personal Information
In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information for one or more business purposes:
Identifiers;
California Customer Records Personal Information categories;
Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law;
Commercial information;
Biometric Information;
Internet or other network activity information;
Geolocation Data;
Sensory Data;
Professional or employment-related information.
Inferences drawn from other personal information.
We disclose your Personal Information for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties:
Our affiliates;
Commercial providers;
Enterprise accounts, such as your employer;
Products and Services offered by us may be fulfilled by third parties, and in that case, we may share information with them for order fulfillment, diagnostics and other purposes related to your transaction; and
Service providers and other third parties we use to support our business, including without limitation those performing core services (such as billing, credit card processing, customer support services, customer relationship management, accounting, auditing, administering sweepstakes, surveys, advertising and marketing, analytics, email and mailing services, data storage, and security) related to the operation of our business and/or the Services, and making certain functionalities available to our Users;
Third parties to which you or your agents authorize us to disclose your Personal Information in connection with the Services we provide to you.
We may disclose your Personal Information for legal reasons. Specifically, we will share Personal Information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Wahoo Fitness if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Fulfill any purpose for which you provide it;
Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;

We attempt to notify Users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.
We may disclose your Personal Information in the event of a business transfer or as part of diligence relating to a potential business transfer, but only provided appropriate contractual safeguards are in place to prevent the further disclosure, dissemination, or use of your Personal Information. If we establish a new related entity, are acquired by, or merged with another organization, or if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another organization, Personal Information about our Users is often a transferred business asset. In the event that Wahoo Fitness itself or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Personal Information about our Users may be one of the transferred assets.
Wahoo Fitness may compile and share your information in aggregated form (i.e., in a manner that would not personally identify you) or in de-identified form so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual (“De-Identified Information”). We may disclose such de-identified information publicly and to third parties, or to Wahoo Fitness Partners under agreement with us.

Comply with a legal obligation; or

Your Ad Choices
As described above, we or third party partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser when you visit our Sites for the purpose of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising” or “interest-based advertising”). You may find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make, including opt-out of having your information used for internet-based advertising, through the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at the
NAI Service
, and the
Digital Advertising Alliance
(the “DAA”) at the
DAA consumer choice service
. Wahoo Fitness is a participant in the online industry’s self-regulatory program administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA’s principles applicable to interest-based ads.
The tools provided at the
DAA opt-out page
and the
NAI opt-out page
are provided by third parties, not Wahoo Fitness. Wahoo Fitness does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
Third Party Links
The Sites and Services may contain links to web pages operated by parties other than Wahoo Fitness. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Site or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects, and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party's website. Wahoo Fitness strongly recommends that each User review the third party's terms and policies.
International Transfer
Wahoo Fitness is a global company with its headquarters located in the United States. Sharing data across borders may be essential in the performance of the Services which we provide, and as a result, your Personal Information may be collected, transferred to and stored by us and our affiliates outside your jurisdiction, including outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and in countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and that may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction.
We will, subject to applicable law, rely upon legally permitted data transfer mechanisms in order to transfer, process and store your Personal Information in a jurisdiction outside of your home jurisdiction. We will ensure that the recipient of your Personal Information offers an adequate level of data protection and security.
We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have put in place commercially reasonable technical and organizational procedures to safeguard the information and Personal Information we collect on the Sites.
How We Protect Personal Data
Wahoo Fitness maintains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the User's Personal Information against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context, and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms. For example, we restrict access to personal information to Wahoo Fitness employees, contractors, business partners and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and Secure Socket Layer software (SSL) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data.
If Wahoo Fitness collects account information for payment or credit, Wahoo Fitness will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered.
Children
Our website is not intended for children under 16 years of age. We do not intentionally gather Personal information about visitors who are under the age of 16. If a child has provided us with Personal Information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us to have the information deleted from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 16 in the applicable jurisdiction, please contact us at privacy@wahoofitness.com. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a child under 16, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
Direct Marketing and “Do Not Track” Signals
Wahoo Fitness does not track its users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to allow you to opt out of data collection through those technologies.
California residents are entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed Personal Data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Under the California “Shine the Light” law, California residents may opt-out of our disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Data with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request to privacy@wahoofitness.com. California users may request further information about our compliance with this law by contacting us at privacy@wahoofitness.com or by writing to us at the address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section.
FINANCING AND EXTENDED WARRANTY PROGRAMS
In order to be able to offer you payment and extended warranty options, we will pass to third parties Klarna, Affirm, and Extend certain of your Personal Data, such as contact information and order details, in order for Klarna, Affirm, and Extend to assess whether you qualify for their payment and extended warranty options and to tailor their options for you.
Your personal data is handled in accordance with applicable data protection law and in accordance with the information in Klarna’s, Affirm’s, and Extend’s privacy policies applicable to your jurisdiction.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services or programs, email notification of privacy policy changes).
