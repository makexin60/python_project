third country
"), we will inform you of this separately in this privacy policy. Any transfer to third countries is compliant with the respective legal requirements. In case of a data transfer to the United States of America, this means that the requirements of the applicable adequacy decision of the EU Commission are observed.
3. Use of our Internet offer
When using our Internet offer, different data processing may occur depending on the type of use.
a) Hosting
Our Internet offer is operated on the servers of the CDN provider Webflow, Inc., 398 11th Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (hereinafter "
Webflow
"). This means that the data we collect when you visit our website may also be processed and stored in the USA.
The
legal basis
for
the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interest to use the services of a professional provider for the secure and efficient operation of our website.
We have executed a Data Processing Agreement with Webflow in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.

.
b) Informational use
When you access our Internet offer, our web servers automatically collect general information that is technically necessary for its presentation. This includes the web browser used, the operating system used, the domain name of your internet service provider, the IP address of the device you are using, the website from which you are visiting us, the pages of our internet offer that you have visited, and the date and duration of your visit.
We are not able to use this data to identify you. This information is merely statistically evaluated by us in order to improve the functionality of our internet offer. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Insofar as we ask for your consent, the data processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. Your consent can be revoked at any time.
c) Special forms of use
Special forms of use of our Internet offer may result in us processing additional personal data.
i. Contact us
You have the possibility to contact us by e-mail, by phone or via our contact form. We will store your personal data transmitted in this way. The data will be processed exclusively to handle your contact request. The
legal basis
for the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest to process the data for the purpose of handling and responding to your inquiry. The data will be stored until it is no longer required to achieve the purpose of the conversation with you and the matter of your request has been comprehensively resolved.
Another
legal basis
for our processing is, for example, if you have expressly consented to the processing of your data when using our contact form, your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time.
If your request aims to enter into a contract with us, the additional legal basis for the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. This data will be stored as long as it is necessary for the execution of the contract or the pre-contractual measures. Beyond that, we only store your data in order to comply with legal obligations (e.g. tax obligations) (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR).
In addition to the data that you voluntarily provide us with, we may receive the date and time of transmission of your data to us, as well as your IP address. The processing of this data corresponds to our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) to ensure the security of our systems and to prevent abuse. This data, which we additionally collect will be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed, at the latest when the matter of your request has been comprehensively resolved.
We will not relate or combine any data communicated to us in the course of contacting us with other data collected from you, unless you have given us your express consent to do so. This consent can be revoked at any time. You can inform us at any time that you would like us to delete the data provided in the course of the conversation. In this case, all personal data of the conversation will be deleted, if permissible, and a continuation of the conversation is not possible.
ii. Newsletter
You can register for our e-mail newsletter both via our app and via our website. For this, we need your e-mail address in addition to your express consent.
We will only send you the newsletter if you first confirm your registration via a confirmation e-mail sent to you for this purpose by clicking on the link provided for this purpose. This is to ensure that no other person can subscribe to the newsletter on your behalf. You must confirm your registration promptly after receiving the confirmation e-mail. Otherwise, your newsletter registration request will be automatically deleted from our database.
The
legal basis for
sending
the newsletter as well as additional information is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. By sending and confirming the newsletter registration request, you agree to the processing of your data by us.
In addition, we store the date and time of transmission of your data to us, as well as your IP address, as part of your newsletter registration. The processing of this data corresponds to our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, in order to ensure the security of our systems and to prevent abuse. For the purpose of sending and verifying our confirmation email, we also store your IP address as well as the date and time of confirmation by clicking the link.
The purpose of processing your e-mail address is to enable us to send you the newsletter. Your data will be processed exclusively in connection with the sending of our newsletter. Further data within the scope of the registration will be used to ensure the security of our services and to prevent abuse of the e-mail address used.
Your data will only be stored for as long as is necessary to achieve the purpose. Your e-mail address will only be stored beyond the period of your newsletter subscription if you have given your express consent. The data that we additionally collect automatically during your subscription (IP address, date and time) will be deleted at the latest when you terminate your newsletter subscription. This does not affect data that has been stored by us for other purposes.
We use the service Brevo of Sendinblue GmbH, Köpenicker Str. 126, 10179 Berlin to send the newsletter. The processing of your data by Sendinblue is governed by a Data Processing Agreement pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR, which we have executed with Sendinblue.
Our newsletter uses
tracking functionalities
, specifically a so-called tracking pixel as well as link tracking. This means that we can track if and when you have opened the newsletter and any links within the newsletter. We can access aggregated statistics that our service provider (see above) automatically creates. Therefore, we are able to know which percentage of recipients opened the newsletter or which content was particularly well received. This data is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns and can be used by us to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients. If you do not agree with this tracking, we ask you to unsubscribe from the newsletter. This can be done at any time, for example by clicking on the corresponding link contained in every newsletter email.
We only evaluate your user behavior if you have consented to the sending of the newsletter and the related evaluation of personal data. The
legal basis for
the data processing is your consent in accordance with § 25 para. 1 TTDSG and Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR.
TERMINATION / Unsubscribe Newsletter
You can
unsubscribe
or
terminate
your subscription to
our newsletter at any time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to separately revoke your consent to newsletter tracking. If you wish to object to the newsletter tracking, you are required to cancel the newsletter.  You will find the link to do so at the end of each newsletter email. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by sending us a corresponding message.
By doing so, you revoke your consent with effect for the future or object to any further use of your data for the purpose of sending and tracking the newsletter. After unsubscribing, your e-mail address will be deleted from our newsletter distribution list immediately, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, as might be permitted by law as explained in this privacy notice. The revocation of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until you revoked your consent.
d) Third-party tools
Our website uses functions that are offered by service providers commissioned by us. If, within the scope of these functionalities, personal data is processed by the service provider on our behalf, we have concluded a Data Processing Agreement with the service provider pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR. This means that the service provider only processes personal data if this is necessary for the services they offer, and that we ensure through legal, technical and organizational measures as well as regular checks that the way in which this data is processed complies with legal requirements. In particular, our service providers are not permitted to disclose personal data processed by them in this context or to use it for other purposes, such as their own commercial purposes.
Links to social networks
Our website contains links to the social networks Facebook, Tiktok, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram. This is merely a button with a link that forwards you to the corresponding social network when you click it. If you do not click on the link, we therefore do not transmit any personal data to the corresponding social network. However, if you click on the link and are forwarded to the corresponding social network, the processing of personal data by this social network takes place outside of our website.
4. Download our app
You can download our app from an app store of your choice (Apple App Store or Google Play Store, hereinafter "
Store
") to a suitable end device (hereinafter generally "
smartphone
"). When downloading the app to your smartphone, the information required for this purpose, i.e., among other data, store username, email address and customer number of your account, time of download, payment information and the individual device identification number, is transmitted to the respective store. We cannot affect this data collection and are not responsible for it. We process this data only insofar as this is necessary for downloading the app to your smartphone. We do not store this data beyond this purpose.
The
legal basis for
this data processing is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interest to enable you to download and install the app by processing the data required for this purpose.
5. Use of our app
a) Hosting
Our app is operated on the servers of Zurkuhl GmbH, Fester Straße 54. 40882 Ratingen, Germany (hereinafter "
Zurkuhl
"). This means that the data we collect during your general use of the app is stored in Germany and thus within the EU.
The
legal basis for
this processing of your personal data is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interest to use the services of a professional provider for the secure and efficient provision of our app.
We have concluded a Data Processing Agreement with Zurkuhl in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.
At this point, we would like to transparently point out that we cannot comprehensively list all functionalities of the app and, in particular, the personalized advertising measures that significantly finance the app on Zurkuhl's servers, but instead rely on third-party tools, services, and advertising networks for this purpose. These providers are often located in third countries (e.g., the United States of America), so that data transfers to third countries typically occur in this context. You can find more information about this data processing and corresponding data transfers in the following sections.
b) General information about using the app
During the use of our app, an internet connection is established. Here, we collect and process many different personal data, especially data that you actively enter (e.g., message content) as well as data that is accrued during your use of certain app functionalities (e.g., sending a like, sending a message, in-app purchases, starting a session).
The processing of this personal data is technically necessary in order to provide you with the abovementioned and many other functionalities of our app in a convenient manner and to ensure the stability and security of our information technology systems.
The following data items are processed at the start of the session:
IP address
Smartphone model
Operating system version
Device ID
Date and time of login
Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
Your user account, if such an account exists
In the event that you use further functionalities of the app, the personal data required for the selected feature will be processed in addition to the aforementioned data, such as:
Date and time of interaction
Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
The message content when sending a message
The reference point of a like
The purchased product in case of an in-app purchase
The specific personal data therefore depends transparently on your respective interaction with the app.
Theoretically, it is possible to relate such data to your person. However, we only store this data temporarily. As soon as the data is no longer required to achieve the aforementioned purposes, we delete it immediately. The storage period therefore depends on the category of the data. Registration data and data on purchases are stored for the duration of the registration. Message data is stored for 6 months.
In general, we delete your personal data from our live system immediately when you delete your user account with us. After deleting the user account, we only store pseudonymous data for statistical evaluation of app usage, detached from individual users, as well as data we need to comply with our legal obligations (e.g., tax obligations).
The processing of this data is necessary for the provision of our app with its various, modern features. The
legal basis
is therefore our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. For individual functions, we may rely on your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. Insofar as we have a contractual obligation to provide you with the app, the legal basis for data processing for which we do not obtain your consent is the fulfillment of the contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.
The processing of data due to our legal obligations is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR.
c) App registration
To use our app, you must register as a user within the app used by you. For this purpose, you must provide us with the following information:
E-mail address
Password
Desired username
Gender identity
Usage preference (friendship or dating)
Desired gender identity of the contact proposals
Date of birth
User photo
We process this data for the purpose of providing the features associated with your account, i.e., for the purpose of fulfilling a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. In addition, this data is required to fulfill the app's main purpose of connecting users with similar interests. This suggestion functionality requires a minimum amount of information to be provided by users. An additional
legal basis
is therefore our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.
You also have the option of registering with us via social login using an existing Google or Apple account. In this case, in addition to the above-mentioned data, we process the e-mail address you have provided to Google or Apple. If you decide to do so, Google or Apple receives the information that you have registered or logged in to our app. It is possible that Google or Apple processes further personal data in this context, for example about your smartphone, as part of a usage profile and uses this for purposes of advertising or market research, for example. You have the right to object to this, but you must assert this right against Google or Apple.
We would like to point out that it is your choice whether you would like to use the social login feature. Our offer of such a login as a voluntary option is based on the legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR to offer low-threshold login options on request.
d) Cross-app display of your profile within the Jaumo network
If you have registered for one of our apps and created a profile within this app, we will ask for your consent to display your profile in the other apps of our Jaumo network after you have registered. In this way, we want to maximise your chances of networking with users of our other apps with similar interests.
Within which other apps from the Jaumo network your profile will be displayed if you give your consent depends on the specific search criteria you have defined within your profile:
Unless you have specified search criteria in your profile that also match the Finally, Disco, Spicy and/or CSL apps and give us your consent, your profile will be displayed within the Jaumo, Lovely and Bloom apps.
For a better understanding:
- Example 1: If you have registered for the Jaumo app and consented to the cross-app display of your profile, we will also display your profile to users of the Lovely and Bloom apps.
- Example 2: If you have registered for the Spicy app and have consented to the cross-app display of your profile, we will also display your profile to users of the Jaumo, Lovely and Bloom apps.
If, on the other hand, you have defined special search criteria in your profile that match our other apps Finally, Disco, Spicy and/or CSL and have given your consent, your profile will not only be displayed in the apps Jaumo, Lovely and Bloom, but also within Finally, Disco, Spicy and/or CSL,
provided that these apps correspond to your search criteria. For a better understanding:
- Example 1: You have registered for the Jaumo app and consented to the cross-app display of your profile. Your profile will also be displayed to users of the Lovely and Bloom apps (see above). In addition, you have specified in your search criteria that you are looking for dates
with singles over 50. In this case, your profile will also be shown to users of the Finally app.
- Example 2: You have registered for the Jaumo app and consented to your profile being displayed across all apps. Your profile will also be displayed to users of the Lovely and Bloom apps (see above). In addition, you have specified in your search criteria that you are looking for LGBTQ dates. In this case, your profile will also be shown to users of the Spicy app.
We would like to point out that regardless of whether you have consented to the cross-app display of your profile, the profiles of users who have consented to the cross-app display of their profiles themselves will also be displayed within the app you are using in the individual case. The above
statements and examples apply accordingly to these users. The cross-app profile display shown here only takes place if you have given us your consent for this via the consent banner provided. The
legal basis
is therefore always consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR.
You can
withdraw
the consent you have given
at any time
by accessing the profile tab of the app and deactivating the cross-app profile display in your privacy settings and thus withdrawing your consent.
e) App permissions
To use individual features of our app, it is necessary to grant the app certain permissions. If you do not wish to grant these permissions, you will not be able to use the corresponding features.
If only people in your vicinity are to be displayed, you must permit location access.
You can permit the app to send you notifications, for example, to let you know when you have new messages.
You can permit the app to access your smartphone's microphone to record voice messages or join a live voice chat.
In addition, it is required that you give the app permission to access your smartphone's camera if you want to take a profile picture, or permit access to your smartphone's picture gallery if you want to select an existing picture as your profile picture.
The
legal basis for
the processing of personal data regarding these permissions is in each case the fulfillment of a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. The legal basis for access to information in your device and storage of information in your device following the granting of authorization is Section 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG.
You are free to grant and revoke the corresponding permissions to the app at any time. The mere granting of permissions does not permanently store any additional personal data. Rather, this will be determined by your use of the corresponding features.
‍
f) Consent management using Google UMP
Our App uses the Google User Messaging Platform ("
Google UMP
"), which is provided by Google
Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland for users from the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States of America ("
Google
") for all other users, to manage advertising consent as well as consent to the use of other services.
The consent banner provided by this platform allows us to clearly and transparently explain which third-party providers could process your data in the event that you grant us advertising consent. Furthermore, the banner allows us to manage consent beyond advertising purposes.
The
legal basis for
the use of Google UMP is therefore our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.
You can always access the Google UMP to manage your consent in the app's profile tab under "Privacy".
g) Use without advertising consent
You have the choice to use our app free of charge. However, since our free offer is financed by advertising, the use of the full range of functions requires that you consent to personalized advertising. Otherwise, you have the choice of either using only basic account management functions (changing the password as well as deleting the account) or booking a paid subscription ("
Pure subscription
").
If you have a Pure subscription, no additional consent is required to use our app. However, even if you have a Pure subscription, you can give us additional consent, for example, for features that help improving our app’s user experience.
h) Use with advertising consent
If you choose to consent to personalized advertising, we use tools and services from various third-party providers to select, manage, and display advertising content. The high number of different tools and services results from the fact that we use a wide variety of advertising networks in order to make the display of advertising content profitable and to be able to offer our app free of charge.
To share consent across providers, our app uses the Transparency and Consent Framework ("
TCF
") of the Interactive Advertising Bureau ("
IAB
") Europe, a digital marketing network.
TCF is a regularly updated standard for obtaining user consent, especially in the area of personalized advertising. In other words, this means that your consent can be shared with other providers using TCF. This is done by means of a so-called TC string, i.e., pseudonymized information regarding the extent and purpose of your advertising consent. This TC string can be shared via the standardized interface of the IAB with third-party providers that book advertising slots in our app.
For you, this simplifies the process of granting as well as revoking consent, while the use of TCF makes cooperation with our partners easier for us.
We currently use the IAB TCF in version 2.2, in accordance with the specifications of the Google UMP consent tool used in our app. For more information, please visit
https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
.
You can give your advertising consent when using our app via our Google UMP consent tool. For this purpose, the corresponding consent banner is displayed when you first open the app. You can always find the Google UMP in the app’s profile tab under "Privacy".
Google UMP allows you not only to give or reject consent, but also define the scope of your advertising consent, for example, with regard to the processing purposes and third-party providers involved. In addition, Google UMP will provide you with more detailed information about the processing purposes, third-party providers, and data protection by third-party providers.
If you provide us with unrestricted advertising consent, a variety of third-party vendors and advertising networks will receive and process substantial personal data about you for a variety of purposes. Processing purposes may include, in particular:
Display of contextual ads,
Creation of a personalized display and content profile about you and your interests in order to display personalized ads and personalized content relevant to you,
Display of personalized ads based on this profile,
Tracking of performance and effectiveness of the ads and content you view or interact with,
Market research to learn more about the audiences that use our app and view ads and content,
Improvement of existing systems and software and development of new products.
In summary, the data processing in the advertising context is aimed at tracking your user behavior, displaying advertising and content to you based on your user behavior and your interests and needs, analyzing the success of the displayed advertising and content, and continuously optimizing the advertising and content.
In addition, based on your unrestricted advertising consent, various information (e.g., device ID) from the device you are using is accessed and information is stored in your device, for which various technologies are used.
The data processing outlined here and listed in detail in the Google UMP will only take place if you have given us your express consent through the consent banner provided. Consequently, the
legal basis
always will be consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR or § 25 (1) TTDSG.
If a data transfer to third countries is part of the data processing, this is carried out - depending on the processing - in accordance with one of the transfer mechanisms provided for in Art. 45 et seq. GDPR (e.g., adequacy decision of the EU Commission) and compliant with the respective requirements of the transfer mechanism.
You can revoke your consent at any time by opening the app’s profile tab and revoking the consent under "Privacy" in Google UMP. If you do not wish to log in, you can also remove the data by using the "Delete app data" function of your device’s operating system which automatically revokes all consent granted in Google UMP.
Below, we have outlined some of the key tools, services, and advertising networks that we use if you provide us with your consent. You can find comprehensive information about all tools, services, and ad networks in Google UMP, which you can access in the app's profile tab under "Privacy".

h) Other functionalities
Our apps offer additional functionalities that do not serve the purpose of displaying personalized advertisements. These features are designed to make the use of our apps safer and more enjoyable, while also contributing to the continuous improvement and expansion of our services.
A key component of these measures is the use of the ChatGPT API, which we utilize primarily for the automated analysis and review of images to detect potential violations and prevent misuse.
If the processing of personal data by our service provider is required in this context, it is carried out strictly within the framework of a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR. This agreement ensures that personal data is only processed to the extent necessary for the provided functionality and that appropriate legal, technical, and organizational measures are in place. Additionally, we conduct regular reviews to ensure that data processing complies with legal data protection requirements.
i. Firebase Crashlytics
Firebase Crashlytics is part of the development tool Google Firebase, a development of Google, which is offered in Europe by Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, and outside Europe by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States of America.
Firebase Crashlytics allows us to detect app crashes and malfunctions in real time. This allows us to find out how the app crashed or malfunctioned and fix it faster.
Firebase Crashlytics processes various personal data and accesses corresponding information on your device, such as:
- Crashlytics installation UIDs,
- Firebase installation ID,
- Breakpad mini-dump formatted data (NDK crashes only).
- Timestamp of the crash
- Bundle ID and the full version number of the app.
- Name and version of the operating system of the device
- A boolean value indicating whether the device has been jailbroken/rooted.
- Model name of the device, CPU architecture, amount of RAM and storage space.
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack traces to associate crashes with a project, display them in the Firebase Console, and help us debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics installation UIDs to measure the number of users affected by a crash, and minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored while the crash session is being processed, and then deleted. The Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will improve crash reporting and crash management services. Firebase Crashlytics stores crash stack traces, extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including Crashlytics installation UIDs) for 90 days.
The
legal basis
for
data processing within the scope of Firebase Crashlytics is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, for access to device information § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG.
More information about Firebase Crashlytics can be found at

ii. Giphy
Giphy is a tool by Giphy Inc., 416 West 13th Street, Suite 207, New York, NY 10014, United States of America. Using Giphy, we can provide you with moving image files, so-called GIFs, which you can include in messages to other users.
In the event that GIFs are used in a conversation, a direct connection is established with Giphy's servers. This provides Giphy with your IP address and the information that you have visited the page on which the GIF was embedded. The service may also store a random identifier on your device. The service is initialized only when it is technically necessary (e.g., when you want to send a GIF, or a GIF is displayed in a conversation).
We do not use Giphy for market analysis, as we do not provide our own GIFs.
The
legal basis
for
data processing within Giphy is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.  It corresponds to our legitimate interests to enable you to communicate with other app users in a modern way using GIFs. The legal basis for the possible storage of a random identifier on your device is Section 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG.

third country
"), we will inform you of this separately in this privacy policy. Any transfer to third countries is compliant with the respective legal requirements. In case of a data transfer to the United States of America, this means that the requirements of the applicable adequacy decision of the EU Commission are observed.
3. Use of our Internet offer
When using our Internet offer, different data processing may occur depending on the type of use.
a) Hosting
Our Internet offer is operated on the servers of the CDN provider Webflow, Inc., 398 11th Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (hereinafter "

for
the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interest to use the services of a professional provider for the secure and efficient operation of our website.
We have executed a Data Processing Agreement with Webflow in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.

.
b) Informational use
When you access our Internet offer, our web servers automatically collect general information that is technically necessary for its presentation. This includes the web browser used, the operating system used, the domain name of your internet service provider, the IP address of the device you are using, the website from which you are visiting us, the pages of our internet offer that you have visited, and the date and duration of your visit.
We are not able to use this data to identify you. This information is merely statistically evaluated by us in order to improve the functionality of our internet offer. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Insofar as we ask for your consent, the data processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. Your consent can be revoked at any time.
c) Special forms of use
Special forms of use of our Internet offer may result in us processing additional personal data.
i. Contact us
You have the possibility to contact us by e-mail, by phone or via our contact form. We will store your personal data transmitted in this way. The data will be processed exclusively to handle your contact request. The
legal basis
for the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest to process the data for the purpose of handling and responding to your inquiry. The data will be stored until it is no longer required to achieve the purpose of the conversation with you and the matter of your request has been comprehensively resolved.
Another
legal basis
for our processing is, for example, if you have expressly consented to the processing of your data when using our contact form, your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time.
If your request aims to enter into a contract with us, the additional legal basis for the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. This data will be stored as long as it is necessary for the execution of the contract or the pre-contractual measures. Beyond that, we only store your data in order to comply with legal obligations (e.g. tax obligations) (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR).
In addition to the data that you voluntarily provide us with, we may receive the date and time of transmission of your data to us, as well as your IP address. The processing of this data corresponds to our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) to ensure the security of our systems and to prevent abuse. This data, which we additionally collect will be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed, at the latest when the matter of your request has been comprehensively resolved.
We will not relate or combine any data communicated to us in the course of contacting us with other data collected from you, unless you have given us your express consent to do so. This consent can be revoked at any time. You can inform us at any time that you would like us to delete the data provided in the course of the conversation. In this case, all personal data of the conversation will be deleted, if permissible, and a continuation of the conversation is not possible.
ii. Newsletter
You can register for our e-mail newsletter both via our app and via our website. For this, we need your e-mail address in addition to your express consent.
We will only send you the newsletter if you first confirm your registration via a confirmation e-mail sent to you for this purpose by clicking on the link provided for this purpose. This is to ensure that no other person can subscribe to the newsletter on your behalf. You must confirm your registration promptly after receiving the confirmation e-mail. Otherwise, your newsletter registration request will be automatically deleted from our database.
The
legal basis for
sending
the newsletter as well as additional information is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. By sending and confirming the newsletter registration request, you agree to the processing of your data by us.
In addition, we store the date and time of transmission of your data to us, as well as your IP address, as part of your newsletter registration. The processing of this data corresponds to our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, in order to ensure the security of our systems and to prevent abuse. For the purpose of sending and verifying our confirmation email, we also store your IP address as well as the date and time of confirmation by clicking the link.
The purpose of processing your e-mail address is to enable us to send you the newsletter. Your data will be processed exclusively in connection with the sending of our newsletter. Further data within the scope of the registration will be used to ensure the security of our services and to prevent abuse of the e-mail address used.
Your data will only be stored for as long as is necessary to achieve the purpose. Your e-mail address will only be stored beyond the period of your newsletter subscription if you have given your express consent. The data that we additionally collect automatically during your subscription (IP address, date and time) will be deleted at the latest when you terminate your newsletter subscription. This does not affect data that has been stored by us for other purposes.
We use the service Brevo of Sendinblue GmbH, Köpenicker Str. 126, 10179 Berlin to send the newsletter. The processing of your data by Sendinblue is governed by a Data Processing Agreement pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR, which we have executed with Sendinblue.
Our newsletter uses
tracking functionalities
, specifically a so-called tracking pixel as well as link tracking. This means that we can track if and when you have opened the newsletter and any links within the newsletter. We can access aggregated statistics that our service provider (see above) automatically creates. Therefore, we are able to know which percentage of recipients opened the newsletter or which content was particularly well received. This data is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns and can be used by us to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients. If you do not agree with this tracking, we ask you to unsubscribe from the newsletter. This can be done at any time, for example by clicking on the corresponding link contained in every newsletter email.
We only evaluate your user behavior if you have consented to the sending of the newsletter and the related evaluation of personal data. The
legal basis for
the data processing is your consent in accordance with § 25 para. 1 TTDSG and Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR.
TERMINATION / Unsubscribe Newsletter
You can
unsubscribe
or
terminate
your subscription to
our newsletter at any time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to separately revoke your consent to newsletter tracking. If you wish to object to the newsletter tracking, you are required to cancel the newsletter.  You will find the link to do so at the end of each newsletter email. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by sending us a corresponding message.
By doing so, you revoke your consent with effect for the future or object to any further use of your data for the purpose of sending and tracking the newsletter. After unsubscribing, your e-mail address will be deleted from our newsletter distribution list immediately, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, as might be permitted by law as explained in this privacy notice. The revocation of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until you revoked your consent.
d) Third-party tools
Our website uses functions that are offered by service providers commissioned by us. If, within the scope of these functionalities, personal data is processed by the service provider on our behalf, we have concluded a Data Processing Agreement with the service provider pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR. This means that the service provider only processes personal data if this is necessary for the services they offer, and that we ensure through legal, technical and organizational measures as well as regular checks that the way in which this data is processed complies with legal requirements. In particular, our service providers are not permitted to disclose personal data processed by them in this context or to use it for other purposes, such as their own commercial purposes.
Links to social networks
Our website contains links to the social networks Facebook, Tiktok, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram. This is merely a button with a link that forwards you to the corresponding social network when you click it. If you do not click on the link, we therefore do not transmit any personal data to the corresponding social network. However, if you click on the link and are forwarded to the corresponding social network, the processing of personal data by this social network takes place outside of our website.
4. Download our app
You can download our app from an app store of your choice (Apple App Store or Google Play Store, hereinafter "
Store
") to a suitable end device (hereinafter generally "
smartphone
"). When downloading the app to your smartphone, the information required for this purpose, i.e., among other data, store username, email address and customer number of your account, time of download, payment information and the individual device identification number, is transmitted to the respective store. We cannot affect this data collection and are not responsible for it. We process this data only insofar as this is necessary for downloading the app to your smartphone. We do not store this data beyond this purpose.
The
legal basis for
this data processing is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interest to enable you to download and install the app by processing the data required for this purpose.
5. Use of our app
a) Hosting
Our app is operated on the servers of Zurkuhl GmbH, Fester Straße 54. 40882 Ratingen, Germany (hereinafter "
Zurkuhl
"). This means that the data we collect during your general use of the app is stored in Germany and thus within the EU.
The
legal basis for
this processing of your personal data is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interest to use the services of a professional provider for the secure and efficient provision of our app.
We have concluded a Data Processing Agreement with Zurkuhl in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.
At this point, we would like to transparently point out that we cannot comprehensively list all functionalities of the app and, in particular, the personalized advertising measures that significantly finance the app on Zurkuhl's servers, but instead rely on third-party tools, services, and advertising networks for this purpose. These providers are often located in third countries (e.g., the United States of America), so that data transfers to third countries typically occur in this context. You can find more information about this data processing and corresponding data transfers in the following sections.
b) General information about using the app
During the use of our app, an internet connection is established. Here, we collect and process many different personal data, especially data that you actively enter (e.g., message content) as well as data that is accrued during your use of certain app functionalities (e.g., sending a like, sending a message, in-app purchases, starting a session).
The processing of this personal data is technically necessary in order to provide you with the abovementioned and many other functionalities of our app in a convenient manner and to ensure the stability and security of our information technology systems.
The following data items are processed at the start of the session:
IP address
Smartphone model
Operating system version
Device ID
Date and time of login
Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
Your user account, if such an account exists
In the event that you use further functionalities of the app, the personal data required for the selected feature will be processed in addition to the aforementioned data, such as:
Date and time of interaction
Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
The message content when sending a message
The reference point of a like
The purchased product in case of an in-app purchase
The specific personal data therefore depends transparently on your respective interaction with the app.
Theoretically, it is possible to relate such data to your person. However, we only store this data temporarily. As soon as the data is no longer required to achieve the aforementioned purposes, we delete it immediately. The storage period therefore depends on the category of the data. Registration data and data on purchases are stored for the duration of the registration. Message data is stored for 6 months.
In general, we delete your personal data from our live system immediately when you delete your user account with us. After deleting the user account, we only store pseudonymous data for statistical evaluation of app usage, detached from individual users, as well as data we need to comply with our legal obligations (e.g., tax obligations).
The processing of this data is necessary for the provision of our app with its various, modern features. The
legal basis
is therefore our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. For individual functions, we may rely on your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. Insofar as we have a contractual obligation to provide you with the app, the legal basis for data processing for which we do not obtain your consent is the fulfillment of the contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.
The processing of data due to our legal obligations is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR.
c) App registration
To use our app, you must register as a user within the app used by you. For this purpose, you must provide us with the following information:
E-mail address
Password
Desired username
Gender identity
Usage preference (friendship or dating)
Desired gender identity of the contact proposals
Date of birth
User photo
We process this data for the purpose of providing the features associated with your account, i.e., for the purpose of fulfilling a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. In addition, this data is required to fulfill the app's main purpose of connecting users with similar interests. This suggestion functionality requires a minimum amount of information to be provided by users. An additional
legal basis
is therefore our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.
You also have the option of registering with us via social login using an existing Google or Apple account. In this case, in addition to the above-mentioned data, we process the e-mail address you have provided to Google or Apple. If you decide to do so, Google or Apple receives the information that you have registered or logged in to our app. It is possible that Google or Apple processes further personal data in this context, for example about your smartphone, as part of a usage profile and uses this for purposes of advertising or market research, for example. You have the right to object to this, but you must assert this right against Google or Apple.
We would like to point out that it is your choice whether you would like to use the social login feature. Our offer of such a login as a voluntary option is based on the legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR to offer low-threshold login options on request.
d) Cross-app display of your profile within the Jaumo network
If you have registered for one of our apps and created a profile within this app, we will ask for your consent to display your profile in the other apps of our Jaumo network after you have registered. In this way, we want to maximise your chances of networking with users of our other apps with similar interests.
Within which other apps from the Jaumo network your profile will be displayed if you give your consent depends on the specific search criteria you have defined within your profile:
Unless you have specified search criteria in your profile that also match the Finally, Disco, Spicy and/or CSL apps and give us your consent, your profile will be displayed within the Jaumo, Lovely and Bloom apps.
For a better understanding:
- Example 1: If you have registered for the Jaumo app and consented to the cross-app display of your profile, we will also display your profile to users of the Lovely and Bloom apps.
- Example 2: If you have registered for the Spicy app and have consented to the cross-app display of your profile, we will also display your profile to users of the Jaumo, Lovely and Bloom apps.
If, on the other hand, you have defined special search criteria in your profile that match our other apps Finally, Disco, Spicy and/or CSL and have given your consent, your profile will not only be displayed in the apps Jaumo, Lovely and Bloom, but also within Finally, Disco, Spicy and/or CSL,
provided that these apps correspond to your search criteria. For a better understanding:
- Example 1: You have registered for the Jaumo app and consented to the cross-app display of your profile. Your profile will also be displayed to users of the Lovely and Bloom apps (see above). In addition, you have specified in your search criteria that you are looking for dates
with singles over 50. In this case, your profile will also be shown to users of the Finally app.
- Example 2: You have registered for the Jaumo app and consented to your profile being displayed across all apps. Your profile will also be displayed to users of the Lovely and Bloom apps (see above). In addition, you have specified in your search criteria that you are looking for LGBTQ dates. In this case, your profile will also be shown to users of the Spicy app.
We would like to point out that regardless of whether you have consented to the cross-app display of your profile, the profiles of users who have consented to the cross-app display of their profiles themselves will also be displayed within the app you are using in the individual case. The above
statements and examples apply accordingly to these users. The cross-app profile display shown here only takes place if you have given us your consent for this via the consent banner provided. The
legal basis
is therefore always consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR.
You can
withdraw
the consent you have given
at any time
by accessing the profile tab of the app and deactivating the cross-app profile display in your privacy settings and thus withdrawing your consent.
e) App permissions
To use individual features of our app, it is necessary to grant the app certain permissions. If you do not wish to grant these permissions, you will not be able to use the corresponding features.
If only people in your vicinity are to be displayed, you must permit location access.
You can permit the app to send you notifications, for example, to let you know when you have new messages.
You can permit the app to access your smartphone's microphone to record voice messages or join a live voice chat.
In addition, it is required that you give the app permission to access your smartphone's camera if you want to take a profile picture, or permit access to your smartphone's picture gallery if you want to select an existing picture as your profile picture.
The
legal basis for
the processing of personal data regarding these permissions is in each case the fulfillment of a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. The legal basis for access to information in your device and storage of information in your device following the granting of authorization is Section 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG.
You are free to grant and revoke the corresponding permissions to the app at any time. The mere granting of permissions does not permanently store any additional personal data. Rather, this will be determined by your use of the corresponding features.
‍
f) Consent management using Google UMP
Our App uses the Google User Messaging Platform ("
Google UMP
"), which is provided by Google
Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland for users from the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States of America ("
Google
") for all other users, to manage advertising consent as well as consent to the use of other services.
The consent banner provided by this platform allows us to clearly and transparently explain which third-party providers could process your data in the event that you grant us advertising consent. Furthermore, the banner allows us to manage consent beyond advertising purposes.
The
legal basis for
the use of Google UMP is therefore our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.
You can always access the Google UMP to manage your consent in the app's profile tab under "Privacy".
g) Use without advertising consent
You have the choice to use our app free of charge. However, since our free offer is financed by advertising, the use of the full range of functions requires that you consent to personalized advertising. Otherwise, you have the choice of either using only basic account management functions (changing the password as well as deleting the account) or booking a paid subscription ("
Pure subscription
").
If you have a Pure subscription, no additional consent is required to use our app. However, even if you have a Pure subscription, you can give us additional consent, for example, for features that help improving our app’s user experience.
h) Use with advertising consent
If you choose to consent to personalized advertising, we use tools and services from various third-party providers to select, manage, and display advertising content. The high number of different tools and services results from the fact that we use a wide variety of advertising networks in order to make the display of advertising content profitable and to be able to offer our app free of charge.
To share consent across providers, our app uses the Transparency and Consent Framework ("
TCF
") of the Interactive Advertising Bureau ("
IAB
") Europe, a digital marketing network.
TCF is a regularly updated standard for obtaining user consent, especially in the area of personalized advertising. In other words, this means that your consent can be shared with other providers using TCF. This is done by means of a so-called TC string, i.e., pseudonymized information regarding the extent and purpose of your advertising consent. This TC string can be shared via the standardized interface of the IAB with third-party providers that book advertising slots in our app.
For you, this simplifies the process of granting as well as revoking consent, while the use of TCF makes cooperation with our partners easier for us.
We currently use the IAB TCF in version 2.2, in accordance with the specifications of the Google UMP consent tool used in our app. For more information, please visit
https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
.
You can give your advertising consent when using our app via our Google UMP consent tool. For this purpose, the corresponding consent banner is displayed when you first open the app. You can always find the Google UMP in the app’s profile tab under "Privacy".
Google UMP allows you not only to give or reject consent, but also define the scope of your advertising consent, for example, with regard to the processing purposes and third-party providers involved. In addition, Google UMP will provide you with more detailed information about the processing purposes, third-party providers, and data protection by third-party providers.
If you provide us with unrestricted advertising consent, a variety of third-party vendors and advertising networks will receive and process substantial personal data about you for a variety of purposes. Processing purposes may include, in particular:
Display of contextual ads,
Creation of a personalized display and content profile about you and your interests in order to display personalized ads and personalized content relevant to you,
Display of personalized ads based on this profile,
Tracking of performance and effectiveness of the ads and content you view or interact with,
Market research to learn more about the audiences that use our app and view ads and content,
Improvement of existing systems and software and development of new products.
In summary, the data processing in the advertising context is aimed at tracking your user behavior, displaying advertising and content to you based on your user behavior and your interests and needs, analyzing the success of the displayed advertising and content, and continuously optimizing the advertising and content.
In addition, based on your unrestricted advertising consent, various information (e.g., device ID) from the device you are using is accessed and information is stored in your device, for which various technologies are used.
The data processing outlined here and listed in detail in the Google UMP will only take place if you have given us your express consent through the consent banner provided. Consequently, the
legal basis
always will be consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR or § 25 (1) TTDSG.
If a data transfer to third countries is part of the data processing, this is carried out - depending on the processing - in accordance with one of the transfer mechanisms provided for in Art. 45 et seq. GDPR (e.g., adequacy decision of the EU Commission) and compliant with the respective requirements of the transfer mechanism.
You can revoke your consent at any time by opening the app’s profile tab and revoking the consent under "Privacy" in Google UMP. If you do not wish to log in, you can also remove the data by using the "Delete app data" function of your device’s operating system which automatically revokes all consent granted in Google UMP.
Below, we have outlined some of the key tools, services, and advertising networks that we use if you provide us with your consent. You can find comprehensive information about all tools, services, and ad networks in Google UMP, which you can access in the app's profile tab under "Privacy".

Firebase Crashlytics allows us to detect app crashes and malfunctions in real time. This allows us to find out how the app crashed or malfunctioned and fix it faster.
Firebase Crashlytics processes various personal data and accesses corresponding information on your device, such as:
- Crashlytics installation UIDs,
- Firebase installation ID,
- Breakpad mini-dump formatted data (NDK crashes only).
- Timestamp of the crash
- Bundle ID and the full version number of the app.
- Name and version of the operating system of the device
- A boolean value indicating whether the device has been jailbroken/rooted.
- Model name of the device, CPU architecture, amount of RAM and storage space.
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack traces to associate crashes with a project, display them in the Firebase Console, and help us debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics installation UIDs to measure the number of users affected by a crash, and minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored while the crash session is being processed, and then deleted. The Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will improve crash reporting and crash management services. Firebase Crashlytics stores crash stack traces, extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including Crashlytics installation UIDs) for 90 days.
The
legal basis
for
data processing within the scope of Firebase Crashlytics is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, for access to device information § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG.

The service is initialized only when it is technically necessary (e.g., when you want to send a GIF, or a GIF is displayed in a conversation).
We do not use Giphy for market analysis, as we do not provide our own GIFs.
The
legal basis
for
data processing within Giphy is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.  It corresponds to our legitimate interests to enable you to communicate with other app users in a modern way using GIFs. The legal basis for the possible storage of a random identifier on your device is Section 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG.

AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “AppLovin”) operates a suite of tools for app developers and other businesses to automate and optimize the marketing and monetization of their platforms, products, or services by enabling the placement of different types of advertisements on digital properties including mobile apps, websites, and connected TV devices (collectively, the “Advertising Services” or “Services”).  As explained below, consumers interact with us in a few ways, primarily through advertisements served by AppLovin on behalf of advertisers.
The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our Services and advertising platform, and our corporate website at www.applovin.com (the “Website”), as well as your choices related to that information.

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.
General Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer who downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services through advertisements served within a digital property, we may collect certain information, including the following:
Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;
Carrier;
Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);
Network connection type and speed;
IP Address;
Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services;
HTTP header information;
Advertising IDs (IDFA/GAID/Amazon FOSAID);
Vendor IDs (IDFV);
App Set IDs; and
Advertising and tracking preferences and restrictions.
Application publishers may choose to share with us additional information including your age or year of birth, gender, email, phone number, and interest segments for purposes of their own direct ad serving.  We do not retain this data or pass it downstream to advertising partners.  Please see the applicable publisher’s privacy policy for more information about their use of first party data.
Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here
, current as of the date listed at the top of that page.
If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, please see the
“Manage Your Privacy Choices”
section below. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or Switzerland, you may also see the
“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.
Manage Your Privacy Choices:
To limit collection of information from mobile devices, please visit your device’s settings to set the “Limit Ad Track” or other similar features on your device. Additionally, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising within ads served by AppLovin. For detailed instructions, see

. You can also make choices about data collection for certain companies by visiting an industry consumer choice platform such as the NAI (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
) or DAA (
https://optout.aboutads.info/
).  You may still receive ads after limiting processing of information for interest-based advertising, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.

If you believe we have served an advertisement to a child or might have any personal information from or about a child, or if you believe a mobile application in which an AppLovin-served advertisement appeared may be designed for, directed to, or pass personal information knowingly from, children in violation of our policies, please contact us via email at
dataprotection@applovin.com
.
Data Security and Retention
We implement reasonable measures to help secure the information we collect through the Services. We retain the data we collect through the Services for up to 2 years.

1. How We Collect & Use Your Personal Data
Personal data means any data that, either on its own or jointly with other data, can be used to identify a natural person. You directly provide us with such data when you use our websites, products, or services, or interact with us by, for example, creating a Huawei account or contacting us for support. We may also obtain data by recording how you interact with our websites, products, or services. For example, we may use technologies like cookies or receive use data from software running on your device. As permitted by law, we may also obtain data from public and commercial third-party sources, for example, purchasing statistics from other companies to support our services. The personal data we collect includes name, gender, enterprise name, job position, postal and email addresses, phone number, login information (account and password), photos, and certificate information, etc., depending on how you interact with Huawei, for example, the website you visit or the products and services that you use. We also collect the information you provide to us and the content of messages you send us, such as the query information you provide, or the questions or information you provide for customer service support.
Before using Huawei’s products or services, you may need to provide personal data.  In some cases you may be able to opt not to disclose your personal data to Huawei. However, not providing Huawei with certain data may mean that we cannot provide you with certain products or services or respond to an issue that you have raised.
We may use your personal data for the following purposes:

If Huawei is involved in a restructuring, merger & acquisition, or a bankruptcy or liquidation lawsuit in a given jurisdiction, your personal data may be disclosed in connection with the transaction. Huawei may also disclose your data when appropriate, for example, to execute Terms and Conditions, when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or when it is in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
4. How to Access & Control Your Personal Data
It is your responsibility to ensure that all personal data submitted to Huawei is correct. Huawei is dedicated to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of personal data and keeping the data up-to-date.
To the extent required by applicable law, you may (i) have the right to access certain personal data we maintain about you, (ii) request that we update or correct inaccuracies in that data, (iii) object or restrict to our use of your personal data, and (iv) ask us to delete your personal data from our database. To exercise these rights, please
click here
to give your feedback online. Your written request may be required for security. We will verify your personal identity as required by local laws. We may decline the request if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the request is a fraudulent, unfeasible or may jeopardize the privacy of others.
If allowed by applicable laws, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time when Huawei processes your personal data based on your consent. However, withdrawal does not affect the legitimacy and effectiveness of how we process your personal data based on your consent before the withdrawal is made; nor does it affect any data processing based on another justification other than your consent.
If you think that the way we process your personal information does not comply with applicable data protection laws, you can contact the relevant competent data protection authority. You can obtain the information for contacting EU data protection authorities at
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm
.
5. How We Protect and Retain Your Personal Data
The security of your personal data is important to us. We use appropriate physical, management, and technical measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss. For example, we use cryptographic technologies for data confidentiality, protection mechanisms to prevent attacks, and access control mechanisms to permit only authorized access to your personal data. We also provide training on security and privacy protection for employees to raise their awareness of personal data protection. Huawei is committed to protecting your personal data; however, please note that no security measure is perfect.
We will retain your personal information for no longer than is necessary for the purposes stated in this Policy, unless otherwise extending the retention period is required or permitted by law. The data storage period may vary with scenario, product, and service. The standards Huawei uses to determine the retention period are as follows: the time required to retain personal data to fulfill business purposes, including providing products and services; maintaining corresponding transaction and business records; controlling and improving the performance and quality of products and services; ensuring the security of systems, products, and services; handling possible user queries or complaints and locating problems; whether the user agrees to a longer retention period; and whether the laws, contracts, and other equivalencies have special requirements for data retention; etc. We will maintain your registration information as long as your account is necessary for service provision. You can choose to deregister your account. After you deregister your account, we will stop providing you with products and services through your account and delete your relevant personal data, provided that deletion is not otherwise stipulated by special legal requirements.
6. How We Process Children's Personal Data
Our websites, products and services are primarily intended for adults. A child must not create a Huawei account without the consent of a parent or guardian. If a child's personal data is collected with prior parental consent, we will only use or disclose the data as permitted by law, with the explicit consent of the child's parents or guardians, or when necessary for the protection of the child. If we accidentally collect a child's personal data without verified prior consent from the child's parents, we will attempt to delete the data as soon as possible.
7. Third-Party Providers and Their Services
To ensure a positive user experience, you may receive content or web links from third parties other than Huawei and its partners ("third parties"). Huawei does not have the right to control such third parties, but you can choose whether to use the links, view the content and/or access the products or services provided by third parties.
Huawei cannot control the privacy practices and data protection policies of third parties that are not subject to this Policy. When you submit personal information to such a third party, please read and refer to the privacy protection policy of the third party.
8. International Transfers of Your Personal Data
As a global company, your personal data collected by Huawei may be processed or accessed in the country/region where you use our products and services or in other countries/regions where Huawei or its affiliates, subsidiaries, service providers or business partners have a presence. These jurisdictions may have different data protection laws. In such circumstances, Huawei will take measures to ensure that data is processed as required by this Policy and applicable laws, which includes when transferring the data subject’s personal data from the EU to a country or region which has not yet been acknowledged by the EU Commission as having an adequate level of data protection, we may use a variety of legal mechanisms, such as signing standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission, obtaining the consent to the cross-border transfer of a data subject in the EU, or implementing security measures like anonymizing personal data before cross-border data transfer. You can

to obtain a copy of the EU’s standard contractual clauses.
9. Updates to This Policy
Huawei reserves the right to update or change this Policy at any time. We will release the latest Privacy Policy on this page for any changes. If major changes are made to the Privacy Policy, we may notify you through different channels, for example, posting a notice on our website or sending you direct notification.

14. Contacting Us
Smaato, Inc. (“Smaato,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) provides this privacy policy to explain how we collect, use, and share information. This privacy policy (“Policy”) covers Smaato’s handling of two types of information:
Information we receive from our Clients about end users (“End Users”) of third-party mobile applications (“apps”) that use our Software Development Kit (“SDK”), other collection interfaces (collectively, “APIs”), the Smaato Demand Platform (“SDX”), or the Smaato Publisher Platform (“SPX”) (collectively, the “Smaato Ad Services”), and
Information we receive through our corporate website at www.smaato.com or any other website on which this Policy is posted, as well as information we get through other corporate services and web portals we make available to clients and business partners (“Smaato Websites”). We describe the information received through the Smaato Websites in Section 5 below, titled “Privacy Practices for the Smaato Websites.”
We encourage consumers to learn about how information (including information we collect) can be used to market to them, and how to exercise their choices to permit or limit such marketing. We describe ways consumers can exercise that choice or opt-out of marketing in Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
1. Introduction and Background
Smaato provides mobile advertising technology services that facilitate transactions among demand-side platforms, advertisers, app developers, publishers of mobile websites and/or apps, and ad exchanges (collectively, “Clients”), and service providers (collectively “Partners”). We do this by making available the Smaato Ad Services and other tools to Clients. Clients use the Smaato Ad Services and other tools to deliver advertising to End Users, and we in turn provide our services to help Clients (and their own customers) to deliver ads that are of interest to End Users. We explain what SDKs and APIs are in Section 3 below, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs,” which also explains how cookies and similar technologies (which we also use to provide the Smaato Ad Services) work.
2. Privacy Practices for the Smaato Ad Services
a. Information Collected Through the Smaato Ad Services
Through the Smaato Ad Services, we may collect information about End Users (to the extent that Clients pass such information to Smaato), which includes:
IP addresses, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information such as information about End Users’ operating system;
Rough geolocation information;
Cookie IDs, Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Google Advertising IDs (collectively, “Mobile IDs”);
Age;
Gender;
Device type and other device information (e.g., whether an End User is using a smartphone or tablet, and related information);
Network provider;
Mobile browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, and Chrome); and
Other unique identifiers that may be associated with an End Users’ device, including identifiers provided by Clients or their service providers.
We refer to all of the above information as the “Service Information.”
b. How We Use the Information Collected Through the Smaato Ad Services
We use the Service Information to provide a variety of services to our Clients related to advertising and marketing, including services we may describe elsewhere on Smaato Websites. This includes use of the Service Information for purposes such as to:
Provide customer, technical, and operational support for the Smaato Ad Services, detect and protect against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity, and resolve disputes and enforce our terms and conditions and other rights we may have. This may also include analyzing, customizing, and improving the features of the Smaato Ad Services;
Provide information and analytics to Clients about the advertising inventory provided through the Smaato Ad Services;
We, or our Clients, may deploy online cookies to track End Users across mobile websites and/or apps, or to associate End Users and these cookies with Mobile IDs. You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in Section 3 below, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs.”
c. How We Share Information We Collect Through the Smaato Ad Services
We share the Service Information with Clients and Partners in order to provide the Smaato Ad Services. For example, we share the Service Information with:
Clients and their marketing and service providers, so they may provide targeted advertising to End Users on mobile websites and/or apps;
Partners that facilitate the functioning of the Smaato Ad Services (e.g., traffic and ad quality verification vendors and data centers).
Even when a Client no longer accesses our SDK, we may continue to use and share Service Information as described in this Policy. The processes we described above often involve cookies or similar technologies, which may be associated with other information about End Users, such as End Users’ interests, demographics, or transactions. This is generally known as “interest-based advertising.” We encourage individuals who are interested in controlling or learning about this type of advertising to go to Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options,” or go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA’s) website at www.aboutads.info. We may also share Service Information with third parties:
Pursuant to a request or authorization by an End User or Client;
If the disclosure is provided to: (a) comply in good faith with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement; (b) enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements; or (c) protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity;
Where the information is aggregated or de-identified; and
As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence).
3. Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs
a. Cookies and Pixel Tags
Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as unique browser identifiers. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your browser. Our servers may deploy a cookie on your browser when you visit the Smaato Websites. Our Clients and Partners may do likewise on the Smaato Websites, our Clients’ and Partners’ websites, and elsewhere. Smaato may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Persistent cookies, unlike session cookies, remain after you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to any given website. Using persistent cookies, a site operator (or a third party they work with) can “remember” what you have previously done on a website and personalize the site, or ads you see, for you. This technology may also provide a site operator or third party (or us, when you visit the Smaato Websites) with information regarding your IP address, browser type, the web pages that you visit just before or after visiting a website, the web pages viewed, and the dates and times of your visits. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access a web page with a pixel tag, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit, and permit us, or our Clients or Partners, to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. We, alone or with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, for example, “remember” you, track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or interact with advertising. We, and our Clients and Partners, use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests. If you wish to opt-out of interest-based mobile advertising, please see Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.” Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the Smaato Websites’ functionalities and offerings, and those of other websites you visit.
b. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs
We, or our Clients or Partners, may use or work with mobile SDKs (including our own SDK(s), which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as Mobile IDs, and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Smaato Ad Services and those using our Smaato Ad Services. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. Sometimes, we obtain data through other (generally, simpler) interfaces that deliver similar data to us, which are commonly referred to (and which we refer to) as APIs. We may use these technologies, for example, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you would like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
4. Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options
In most cases, consumers have control over whether or not they would like to receive relevant ads and marketing emails from our Clients. To change the settings for the cookies Smaato sets on your devices through the Smaato Websites, please visit our Cookie Policy.
a. Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising from Cookies
You can opt-out of many of the publishers, platforms and service providers we work with that support online interest-based advertising from cookies or similar technologies by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer education and opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info (or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are located in the European Union). Some of our publisher Clients have their own opt-out mechanisms that are linked from their websites or their online-posted privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of those companies for these opt-out links if you no longer wish to receive targeted advertising from a certain company, or multiple companies. You can also click below to opt-out of having the Smaato Ad services used to select ads for your browser based on your online web browsing behavior. When you opt-out, an opt-out cookie (from smaato.net) will be stored in your web browser. Our platform will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt-out cookie, and will apply your choice to all companies using Smaato Ad services for online interest-based advertising from cookies. Please note: This type of opt-out is cookie-based, which means that if you block cookies, upgrade your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to opt-out again. Also, in order for your opt-out choice to be effective, you must ensure that your browser is set to accept third-party cookies such as the Smaato opt-out cookie. Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, and you may need to change your browser settings to accept third-party cookies before opting out. If you use a different device or browser, or erase cookies from your browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Even if you opt-out, Smaato may continue to collect data for other purposes and you still will receive advertising from the Smaato Ad Service when you visit websites of a publisher Client who uses our Platform – but such advertising will not be personalized to you.
b. Opting Out of Cross-App Advertising on Mobile Devices
You can opt-out of having your Mobile IDs used for certain types of interest-based mobile advertising (also called “cross-app advertising”), including those performed by Smaato, by accessing the settings on your Apple or Android mobile device, as follows:
Apple Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt-out of most cross-app advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher and enabling “Limit Ad Tracking.”
iOS 7 and Higher: Go to Settings → Privacy → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
iOS 6: Go to Settings → General → About → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
Android Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt-out of most cross-app advertising by going to Google Settings → Ads, and selecting the option to opt-out of interest-based ads.
Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above instructions may change, and the precise language may be different on certain (particularly, on older) devices. Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described above, please check the settings for those devices.
c. Additional Choices
Advertisers may also provide ways for you to opt-out from, or limit their collection of, certain information from and about you. Please refer to the privacy policies for retailers, apps, and mobile websites to learn more about their privacy practices. You may opt-out from receiving promotional emails from us, such as emails to inform you about events and new services, by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any promotional email you receive, or by contacting us at
marketing@smaato.com
*protected email*
. Please note, however, that we may still send you non-promotional emails relating to your relationship with us.
5. Privacy Practices for the Smaato Websites
a. Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
The Smaato Websites provide information regarding Smaato and our products and services. Through the Smaato Websites, we collect the information you voluntarily disclose to us, and we may also obtain automatically-collected information.
i. Information You Disclose to Us
When registering for an account, expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about Smaato or our products and services, or otherwise contacting us through the Smaato Websites, we collect the information you voluntarily disclose to us, such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and other billing information. You may also provide us with certain information about your business or other individuals.
ii. Automatically-Collected Information
When you visit the Smaato Websites, we may use cookies and pixel tags that we associate with unique identifiers to keep track of visitor interactions and personalize your experience on the Smaato Websites. For more information, please see Section 3 above, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs.” We may also use third-party services, such as Google Analytics, that gather information such as your IP address, browser type, the web page from which you came to the Smaato Websites, and the times of your visit. In addition, as you browse the Smaato Websites, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can “remember” your interests. Our display advertising partners may then help us retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the Smaato Websites. To opt-out of such interest-based mobile advertising, please see Section 4 above, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.” Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving ads; rather, the ads you see will be less customized to you.
b. How We Use Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
In addition to the uses described elsewhere in this Policy, we use the information we collect through the Smaato Websites (alone or in combination) to provide, market, improve, and operate the Smaato Websites, Smaato Ad Services, and any other products or services we have or may develop. This includes use of the information to:
Fulfill your requests;
Send information about our products and services, including marketing communications;
Respond to your questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;
Create aggregated or de-identified information;
Comply with applicable laws, prevent fraud, mitigate risk, and perform similar purposes;
Understand usage trends and preferences;
Analyze, improve, and provide products and services;
Customize the content and advertising you see on the Smaato Websites, across the Internet, and elsewhere; and/or
Perform other purposes at your request.
c. How We Share Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
We may share the information we collect through the Smaato Websites in the following situations:
With your consent, including through this Policy;
With our affiliates;
With third parties that help us to operate our business and provide our services, such as entities that provide us with technical, customer, billing, administrative, event planning, marketing, or operational services;
As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence);
When required by law or in response to lawful process, such as a subpoena, or to cooperate in good faith with a request from a government or law enforcement agency or official, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement;
If we believe sharing the information may prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury, or loss; or
If we believe sharing the information is necessary to protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
With respect to aggregated or de-identified information, we may share such information without restriction.
d. Analytics Services
For the purpose of designing our website in line with your needs, evaluating it from a business management perspective, controlling it and continuously optimizing our pages, we use services described in more detail below on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) and f) GDPR. All of the mentioned processing operations result in a transfer of data to the servers of the providers of tracking or targeting technologies commissioned by us. Some of these servers are located in the USA. The data transfer is based on so-called standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles and and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the/or Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles. If you do not agree with the storage and evaluation of your data, you can object to the storage and processing of your data in the consent banner on our website. In this case, a so-called opt-out cookie will be stored in your browser, which means that the services used will not process any session data. However, you may then no longer be able to use all the functions on our websites. You can also prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of our websites to their full extent.
Google reCAPTCHA
We use the reCaptcha service of Google LLC (“Google”), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, to protect us from spam and misuse. We use this processing on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. This service serves to distinguish whether an entry was made by a human being or abusively by automated, machine processing. To determine this, Google places a cookie in your browser when you use the reCaptcha service and collects and processes the following data:
Referrer URL (address of the page on which the captcha is used)
Browser, browser size and resolution, browser plug-ins, date, language setting
Mouse- or Touch-Events within the reCaptcha box
Assignment to a Google account (if you are currently logged in to Google when using the reCaptcha service, this will be recognized and assigned)
Your input behaviour (e.g. answering the reCAPTCHA question, input speed into the form fields, order of selection of input fields by the user) is processed to improve pattern recognition on Google. Google also reads the cookies from other Google services such as Gmail, Search and Analytics. All of the above data is sent to Google in encrypted form. Google’s subsequent evaluation decides in which form the captcha is displayed on the page – in the form of a checkbox or by text input. A readout or saving of personal data from the input fields of the respective form does not take place. Further information about Google’s privacy policy can be found at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ .
Google Analytics – Google Universal Analytics
Smaato uses Google Universal Analytics, a web analytics tool from Google and we have a privacy agreement with Google. Google uses Cookies. The information generated by the Cookies on the use of the Smaato website by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, Smaato has activated the IP anonymization, so that your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before this happens. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of Smaato, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services to us in connection with the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. We use this processing on the basis of Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f) GDPR for range measurement and evaluation (so-called statistics). In this case there is no further processing of your data for marketing or retargeting purposes. This serves the business optimization of our processes. If you have given your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR), we will also process your data for marketing purposes. You can find more information on terms of use and data protection at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms or https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended by the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” in order to ensure the anonymous processing of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). If you do not agree with the processing of your data by Google Analytics, you can object here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
6. Data Access and Retention
Generally speaking, we retain the information collected from the Smaato Websites and Smaato Ad Services for as long as necessary to achieve our objectives as detailed in this Policy, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), California, or Virginia, you may obtain a copy of the information we have about you, and correct or amend such information, by contacting us at
datarights@smaato.com
*protected email*
or by submitting a request to our online web form. You may read more about this and other rights in Section 11 below.
7. Data Security
We have administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in place in our physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks that are designed to protect the information from loss, misuse, or alteration. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information. To assist with data security, you understand that YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF ANY ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS THAT CAN BE USED TO ACCESS ANY ACCOUNT WITH SMAATO. ANY ACTIONS TAKEN USING YOUR ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS ARE YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY.
8. Third-Party Websites and Apps
This Policy only applies to the Smaato Websites and the Smaato Ad Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of websites, developers, or apps that access or use the Smaato Websites or Smaato Ad Services. Likewise, when you access the Smaato Websites, you may be directed to other websites that are also beyond our control. We encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such third parties and websites, and the industry tools that we have referenced in this Policy.
9. Users from Outside the United States
The Smaato Websites and Smaato Ad Services are provided, supported, and hosted in the United States, and their operation is governed by United States law. If you are using the Smaato Websites or Smaato Ad Services from outside the United States, be aware that your Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States and other countries where our facilities are located. The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Smaato Websites or Smaato Ad Services, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share your information as described in this Policy. Please see Section 11 below, titled “The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)” for additional information we provide for the benefit of residents of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK.
10. California Privacy Notice
Please see our California Privacy Notice for California Consumers
here
.
11. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
As of May 25, 2018, a new data privacy law known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) will be in effect through the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. The GDPR requires Smaato and those using our services to provide users with certain information about the processing of their “Personal Data.” “Personal Data” is a term used under the GDPR that means, generally, data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for instance, names, addresses, and Mobile IDs. To comply with the GDPR, we provide the below representations and information, which are specific to persons located in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK and to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of Smaato, Inc., Barcastraße 5, 22087 Hamburg, Germany.
a. Legal Grounds for Processing Personal Data
The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we are relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Sections 1 and 2 above (and Section 5 as to the Smaato Websites) will typically be because:
You provided your consent.
In order to store and gain access to information stored on your device, we rely on your consent. For this “cookie consent” (which applies not only to “cookies” but also to Mobile IDs), we rely on mobile app developers and oblige them contractually to pass on only legally obtained data. We do so to fulfill our obligations under the ePrivacy Directive. We may choose to obtain consent in other cases as well, in which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to such consent and its withdrawal;
The processing is in our legitimate interest.
In some cases, we rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data, in order to provide our and/or other data controllers’ services. Such processing goes beyond the original collection of Mobile IDs. A legitimate interest we rely on, for instance, is the tailoring of promotional communications within mobile apps and services, which is beneficial to End Users and is an integral part of the ecosystem by which freely available content is funded through advertising revenue. This also may include providing analysis of and reporting about ad campaigns. We also rely on legitimate interest when we use Personal Data to maintain the security of our services, such as to detect fraud or to ensure that bugs are detected and fixed;
Contractual relationships.
Sometimes, we process certain data as necessary under a contractual relationship we have (such as our customer records and contact information);
Legal obligations.
Finally, some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
b.	Transfers of Personal Data
As Smaato is a global company and works with other global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided. For instance, we may transfer your data to third parties that we work with who may be located in jurisdictions outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, and which may have data protection laws that are less strict in comparison to those in Europe. When we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data. Your Personal Data will only be transferred to third countries outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK within the legally permissible framework. We transfer Personal Data to third countries outside the EU/EEA (a) as stipulated by law or based on your consent, (b) based on the adequacy decisions of the European Commission (a public and updated list of these countries can be found here) and (c) by contractual regulations such as the EU Standard Data Protection Clauses (a public and updated list of these clauses can be found here). These safeguards shall ensure an adequate level of protection of your Personal Data and you can access further details regarding these safeguards upon request. Smaato, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Smaato has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Smaato has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit

Further, Smaato is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Smaato commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU and UK individuals and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
. or at the contact information in Section 14 below, titled “Contacting Us,” and we will work with you to resolve your issue. If you are a resident of the EU, UK, or Switzerland, you may also contact your appropriate European Data Protection Authority, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, respectively, with questions or complaints about our privacy practices. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, we also commit to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, the international division of the American Arbitration Association (“ICDR-AAA”), an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, you may, under certain circumstances, invoke binding arbitration; please notify us at
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
and/or please visit
https://www.icdr.org/dpf
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of IDCR-AAA are provided at no cost to you.
c.	Personal Data Retention
As a general matter, we retain your Personal Data for only as long as necessary to provide our Smaato Ad Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. We generally render Mobile IDs inactive within 13 months, provided that we may retain them if we have a legal or significant operational need to do so, such as for auditing, corporate record-keeping, compliance accounting, or bug-fixes. If you are a Client of ours and thus have an account with us, we will typically retain your business-to-business Personal Data for a period of 3 years after you have requested that your account be closed, or such account has been inactive.
d.	Your Rights as a Data Subject
The GDPR provides you with certain rights in respect to Personal Data that data controllers hold about you, including certain rights to access Personal Data, to request correction of the Personal Data, to request to restrict or delete Personal Data, and to object to our processing of your Personal Data (including profiling for online ad targeting).
Right to Access:
If you wish to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller, you may do so by requesting access through the e-mail address
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
. When we receive your request, we will provide you with current, step-by-step instructions to follow in order to obtain access. We will then assess requests to exercise data access rights on a case-by-case basis; in doing so, we consider the difficulty of verifying whether a mobile identifier and data we have linked to it truly and solely belongs to the data subject making the request, as well as the potential adverse effects on disclosure of personal data to the wrong individual. Because such improper disclosure would likely adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the data subject, we may limit the Personal Data we make available. Please note that we will only grant requests submitted via email for Personal Data for which we are a data controller, as explained further below. Where we act as a data processor for one of our Clients, we will refer your request to that Client. Please identify the Client your request refers to (if possible), to simplify this process.
Right to Correct:
If you wish to exercise your right to correct Personal Data, you may do so by contacting us at the contact information below.
Right to Object to Processing or to Withdraw Consent:
By using the device-based “opt-out” signals described in Section 4(b) above, you may withdraw consent for processing on which we rely on consent. If you do so, we will cease processing your Personal Data for purposes of our services within 30 days or less. We either collect these opt-out signals ourselves or receive them from the mobile apps we work with.
Right to Erasure.
You also have the right to obtain the erasure of Personal Data concerning you that we hold as a data controller. The above opt-out process satisfies this right. When an End User opts-out through device settings, and we receive this signal from our Clients, the Personal Data we use to provide our services will be deleted within 30 days (if you have an Android device) or permanently rendered disconnected to your device (if you have an iOS device). We will also manually delete your Personal Data, subject our identity verification process mentioned above, if you prefer that we do so; please contact us at
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
for further instructions on exercising this right manually. Please note, however, that we may retain copies of certain Personal Data on inactive or backup files, for our own internal and necessary purposes, such as auditing, accounting and billing, legal, or bug detection. We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill any important purposes that we have in retaining it, principally regarding legal, auditing, accounting, and billing obligations.
Right to Lodge Complaints.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. However, we hope that you will first consult with us, so that we may work with you to resolve any complaint or concern you might have.
e.	Smaato as a Data Controller and a Data Processor
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, we encourage you to direct your inquiry to the relevant data controller, since data controllers hold primary responsibility for your Personal Data. Smaato may act as either a data controller or a data processor in handling your Personal Data, depending on the precise circumstances. For instance, for Personal Data that we use internally and independently to operate the Smaato Ad Services, and for Personal Data that we collect about our Clients, we are a data controller. If Smaato is acting as a data Controller, it remains primarily liable where this data is passed to third parties. But when we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our Clients or Partners in order to provide our services to them, we are a data processor. Thus, for instance, if you have questions about data that is used primarily by a mobile app on which our technology is embedded – or companies that serve ads that use our technology – you should contact those companies regarding questions about the Personal Data they handle and control.

We process your personal information for the purposes of “targeted advertising” ('interest based advertising' for the purposes of this Privacy Policy) as that term is defined under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act and Utah Consumer Privacy Act.
Residents of Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia can opt out of interest based advertising by going to the InMobi
Opt Out
page.
InMobi does not engage in profiling of consumers in furtherance of automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, as those terms are defined under the Colorado Privacy Act.
The privacy laws of your country may grant you the following additional privacy rights relating to their personal information: right to access, request correction, request deletion/anonymization/blocking, restrict/object to processing, withdraw your consent, request data portability, be informed about third parties with whom your data has been shared, and request review of decisions taken exclusively based on automated processing. To exercise these rights, please write to us at
privacy@inmobi.com
.
11. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
InMobi may share your information with clients, customers, partners, the Group and other third parties described above who are based in countries outside of your country of residence (for example, if you are an EEA resident, we may share your information with our non-EEA clients or the Group), subject to any contractual or legal requirements. You agree that all information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world.
While some countries may not have data protection laws that are equivalent to those of the country in which you reside, we will take reasonable measures to protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
12. LEAD GENERATION CAMPAIGNS
InMobi may offer form-based advertising solutions to marketers that include the collection of voluntary information from you as part of an advertisement that contains a questionnaire. Such information may consist of personal data, non-personal information or data, or both. All the information that you voluntarily provide in response to such form or questionnaire is typically forwarded directly to the relevant marketer’s servers or their landing page and in such cases will be governed by such marketer's privacy policies in place at the time of transfer.
In the event any personal data is directly processed by InMobi, you acknowledge that InMobi may be required to store such information for the period during which it continues to manage the applicable lead-generation campaign for its marketer on whose behalf the information is collected. This information may be temporarily stored by InMobi solely for running such form-based campaigns and will be used only for the purpose of optimization of such campaigns, subject to applicable legal/privacy and contractual requirements. InMobi has implemented internal safeguards to protect the temporary storage of this information and uses reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the same. InMobi has mechanisms to delete or anonymize any personal data after the said campaign is concluded or within a period thirty (30) days from the same. Pursuant to the conclusion of the applicable campaign, InMobi may retain and use your Information only to the extent necessary for it to create reports for its client, comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements and no other purpose. Any non-personal information or data submitted by you may be used for improving our Services.
If you have any questions about InMobi lead generation campaigns, please contact us at:
privacy@inmobi.com
. InMobi will refer any enquiries or complaints to the relevant marketer responsible for the processing of data provided as part of lead generation campaigns.

Last updated Dec 18, 2018
This page has answers to some frequently asked questions about Prebid.js. If you don’t find what you’re looking for here, there are other ways to
get help
.
Prebid.org, Inc. respects your right to privacy. This Privacy Notice explains who we are, how we collect, share and use personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. This Privacy Notice applies to personal information that we collect through our website at https://prebid.org/ and its subdomains (“Website”) and via our marketing activities and events.
If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, then please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Notice.
We recommend that you read this Privacy Notice in full to ensure you are fully informed. However, if you only want to access a particular section of this Privacy Notice, then you can click on the relevant link below to jump to that section.
What does Prebid.org do?
Prebid.org is an industry consortium that provides free and open source solutions to implement header bidding. We’re utilized globally and headquartered in the United States. We seek to ensure and promote fair, transparent, and efficient header bidding across the ad tech industry, representing all parts of the programmatic ecosystem, from ad tech vendors to publishers and others.
The open source software products we make available may be utilized by third parties for the purposes of serving online advertisements. These third parties may configure the software to enable pseudonymized data included in bid requests to be transmitted within the online advertising ecosystem. However, Prebid.org has no involvement in these transactions and does not itself transmit, store or otherwise process the pseudonymized data in these transactions. Prebid.org is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties and it is the responsibility of the third party concerned to handle data in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
For more information about Prebid.org, please see the “About” section of our Website at prebid.org/why-join-prebid/
Who does Prebid.org share my personal information with?
We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
to our
third party services providers and partners
who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website or email newsletters), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information.
to any
competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party
where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;
to an actual or
potential buyer
(and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice;
to
any other person with your consent
to the disclosure.
What personal information does Prebid.org collect and why?
The personal information that we may collect from our Website or through our marketing activities broadly falls into the following categories:
Information that you provide voluntarily
Certain parts of our Website may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we may ask you to provide your name and contact details in order to download files or code from us, sign up for an email newsletter, register for or attend one of our events, contribute code, and/or to submit enquiries or emails to us. When you submit code to us, we may ask you to sign our Code Contributor Licensing Agreement. If you are contributing code on behalf of your employer, then we may ask your employer to sign a similar agreement too.
Our Website also includes links to third party sites such as GitHub, Stack, Slack, Reddit, Quora and Twitter to enable you to submit questions and requests to us on those third party sites if you so choose; for example, by using certain tags or by following our profiles on those sites.
From time-to-time, Prebid.org may also host events, online or offline, and invite people to register for these events.
The personal information we collect may include contact information (such as your name and email address), professional information (such as your company name, job title, department or role), other identifying information such as your GitHub handle, as well as the nature of your request or communication to us.
Aside from this, the personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.
Information that we collect automatically
When you visit our Website, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.
Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Website, including the pages accessed and links clicked.
Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Website, where they come from, and what content on our Website is of interest to them. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.
Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further in our
Cookies Notice
.
Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only)
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If we collect and use your personal information in support of our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), such legitimate interests include the provision and improvement of our technology and services to ensure and promote fair, transparent, and efficient header bidding across the ad tech industry, to maintain the quality and security of our Website, to carry out marketing, and to respond to communications and requests. If the legitimate interests we rely on fall outside the purposes set out in this Notice, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
Third-Party Websites
This Notice only applies to the Prebid.org Website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of third party websites which may be linked from our Website. Any access to and use of such linked websites is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties.
How does Prebid.org keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. We are headquartered in the US, and our member companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. Therefore, when we collect your personal information, we may process it in countries that have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and in some cases, may not be as protective.
We will take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice, including signing standard contractual clauses with our third party service providers, or engaging third party service providers that are Privacy Shield certified. Further details can be provided upon request – please write to us using the contact details further below.
Data retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Your data protection rights
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have the following data protection rights:
If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by using the contact details provided under the
“How to contact us”
heading below.
In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the
“How to contact us”
heading below.
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. Alternatively, you can opt out by using the contact details provided under the
“How to contact us”
heading below.
Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available
here
.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Updates to this Privacy Notice
We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our Privacy Notice, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. We will obtain your consent to any material Privacy Notice changes if and where this is required by applicable data protection laws.
You can see when this Privacy Notice was last updated by checking the “last updated” date displayed at the top of this Privacy Notice.

Verve Group, Inc. and VGI CTV, Inc. (together “Verve”) are committed to protecting consumer privacy and to clearly informing users about the collection and use of information.
This Advertising and Data Services Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Verve processes personal information when providing advertising, measurement, and related services to our clients (“Services”). This Policy also describes your choices over such processing. This Policy does not describe how we process personal information relating to our website. For information on how we process personal information relating to our website please read our
Website Privacy Policy
.
“Personal Information” is information that identifies you or your household or can be reasonably linked directly or indirectly with you or your household. This Policy does not apply to anonymous, de-identified, or aggregate personal information as defined under applicable law.
Collecting Personal Information
We collect Personal Information when you knowingly and voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you provide us feedback or request information from us. This Personal Information will only be processed in connection with your feedback or request.
Verve may identify your device and collect Personal Information using an operating system-supplied ID such as Apple’s Advertising Identifier, Google’s Advertising Identifier, or a randomly assigned unique identifier (“Device Identifier”). The advertisements delivered by Verve may include forms or other prompts that allow you to opt-in to share data.
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from any child under 13 years of age. If we are informed or become aware that our Services are being used on a site or app directed at children, we will restrict the use of ad-serving information to uses permitted under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
a) Location Data
In order to make advertising messages as relevant as possible, location data associated with Device Identifiers may be used for targeting ads and as input into location-targeting segments based on the characteristics of locations. Location data is also used to count impressions, clicks, and other metrics to model household locations for the purposes of demonstrating the marketing impact of advertiser campaigns. Location data that you provide to an app or website may be provided to Verve for ad-serving or reporting purposes. In addition, supplemental information may also be used such as a device’s speed of movement and positioning, proximity of nearby devices, or similar information available from an operating system.
You can opt-out of the use of data for location-based tracking by using the settings available on your mobile device. Ads will continue to be selected for you based on more general information, such as location that can be inferred from Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other data.
b) Cookies
We collect information automatically when you use our Services through mobile websites or HTML by using log files and alpha-numeric identifiers known as “cookies” that are usually stored with the device’s web browser. This includes your IP address, browser type, browser language, device type and version, the date and time of your request, the amount of data transferred, the source of your request (page referrer), and the nature of the content delivered to you. We generally use cookies to help with customer tracking. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and/or persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. Persistent cookies can be removed or blocked by following the directions in your internet browser. We also use log files and cookies to improve the quality of Services and pages you have visited.
In addition to the Device Identifiers described above, Verve will collect information about the type of app you are using and details such as IP address, device type, carrier, and operating system. Verve utilizes this information to uniquely identify mobile devices to deliver targeted marketing messages to consumers. We believe that the presentation of relevant marketing messages assists in providing a more meaningful mobile web experience. For example, this technology enables Verve to limit the number of times a specific message is presented to a consumer (frequency capping), to support product category preferential marketing, and to deliver advertising based on your location.
c) Web Beacons
We may permit publishers and advertisers to use a software technology called pixels (a.k.a., web beacons), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, used to report non-personal individual or aggregate information and help us better manage content on our Services. In addition, we may use pixels in our advertisements to let us know which ads have been viewed or to help tailor advertising.
d) Information from Third Parties
Our business partners may also collect Personal Information from you using a variety of technologies, including cookies, software development kits, and other digital trackers deployed on websites, mobile applications, or other digital services. They may share this information about your devices with us. We may add this to the information we obtain from your use of Services. You may be able to modify or disable the collection or sharing of Personal Information in your device settings.
Using Personal Information — Your Choices
Verve uses Personal Information to provide Services to our business partners. They are used to help tailor which ads are displayed to you as you visit websites or apps using our Services. Information that Verve collects as you visit a website or app will be used to create an ad-serving profile used to determine the ads displayed and to report about the effectiveness of that advertising. Personal Information collected by Verve may be linked with other available data about you from our business partners, including linking the various devices you may use. Where permitted by law, we use the information we collect to improve our products and services.
Your Personal Information may be processed by Verve in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information is less stringent than the laws in your country. To opt-out of the use of Personal Information to tailor the ads you are shown, you can use the “Limit Ad Tracking” settings on your device, more information
here
. You will continue to see ads, but they will not be selected based on your activity across unrelated websites or apps. Some of our Services that use cookies offer an opt-out cookie. These opt-out cookies allow you to decline ad targeting on the websites you visit. This option can be exercised
here
.
Sensitive Information
When we create profiles to serve ads based on your activity across different websites or apps, we restrict the use of advertising categories that we deem sensitive based on local law, applicable industry codes, and our own internal standards.
Retention
We retain Personal Information for as long as needed to support our business needs for ad-delivery, reporting, and auditing, but for no longer than two years, after which such data is deleted or minimized by having unique user-level identifiers removed.
Disclosure of Personal Information
Verve may disclose certain Personal Information:
To service providers who help us provide the Services, in which case we will take reasonable steps to ensure that these parties comply with confidentiality obligations and contractually require these parties only use the information as needed to provide services to us;
To third parties that you ask or to whom you have authorized us to send Personal Information;
To any subsidiary organizations, joint ventures, or other organizations under our control or who are under common control with us (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy;
If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes or investigate problems (b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to lawful requests from law enforcement or other public authorities; or (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties; or
In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Verve may disclose Non-Personal Information to business partners, such as analytics companies, and to advertisers, ad networks, other partners, and third parties.
To opt-out of sharing Personal Information by Verve with additional parties, you can use the “Limit Ad Tracking” settings on your device.
Verve may disclose information that is anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated for any purpose.
Security
Verve takes reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data.
Changes to Privacy Policy
Verve is committed to continually examining and reviewing its privacy practices and may make changes to this Privacy Policy.

Subject to local law, you may have certain rights over your Personal Information. These rights may include, depending on the circumstances, the rights to access your Personal Information, delete Personal Information collected from you, receive additional information regarding the information of yours we hold, stop certain disclosure of your Personal Information, withdraw consent for processing you may have given to us, or opt-out of the selling or sharing of your personal information.

Additional Information for California Residents
Personal Data
In the course of providing the Services, Verve processes Personal Information as a “business” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). As a business, we do not sell Personal Information that we process when providing the Services. We disclose the following categories of Personal Information to business partners for the purpose of providing our Services:
Categories we collect:
We provide advertising technology services that facilitate transactions among demand-side platforms, advertisers, app developers, publishers of mobile websites and/or apps, and ad exchanges (collectively, “Clients”). Through our Services, we may collect information about you (to the extent that Clients pass such information to us), which may include mobile advertising identifiers, session and persistent cookies, IP addresses, apps used or downloaded, websites visited, browser and operating system type, type of device used, information actively provided by users responding to a form in an ad, randomly assigned identifiers, and general location information and system information that our SDK may collect about your device or network provider. This information is retained for a period of 14-30 days.
Categories of Sensitive Information:
We do not collect sensitive information.
Sources:
All the information above is collected from your device when you are using an app to visit a website and is provided to us by the business partner you interact with by using their app or viewing an ad. We also acquire this information from advertising or data exchanges.
Each Category is collected for the following business purposes: delivering ads on publisher sites, reporting on ad delivery, securing, protecting, auditing, bug and fraud detection, debugging and repair of errors, the detection, protection, and prosecution of security incidents or illegal activity; enforcing our terms and policies; complying with law.
Each Category is also collected for uses that advance our commercial interests including creating profiles to target ads on behalf of advertisers, using data collected from publishers and from other third parties.
Sale/Sharing Information
Verve may disclose the categories of information described above to business partners, such as analytics companies and may share the information with advertisers, ad networks, other partners, and third parties.
Opt-Out signals
If a Verve publisher or advertiser partner has transmitted to Verve a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” signal, an “Opt-Out of the Use of My Personal Information for Interest-Based Advertising” signal, or a “Limit Use of My Sensitive Personal Information” signal, we will limit our use of Personal Information from that partner and we will act only as a service provider as defined in the CCPA. You may also exercise your opt-out rights as described below.
Access, Deletion and Opt-Out Rights
Subject to certain exceptions and restrictions, the CCPA provides you as a California Resident the right to submit requests to Verve: (i) to provide you with access to the specific pieces and categories of Personal Information collected by Verve about you, the categories of sources for such Personal Information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting such Personal Information, and the categories of third parties with which such information was shared; and (ii) to delete such Personal Information.

for instructions on how you can exercise your California access, deletion and Opt-Out rights. You may also submit a request
here
. We will need to verify your identity and that the information you requested relates to you before completing your rights request. We generally do not associate Personal Information (such as device history) with identified individuals as we generally do not have information such as names or email addresses connected to device information. Therefore, we will need your Advertiser Identifier to process your request. If you do not provide us with the required information, we will be unable to process your request.
You may designate an authorized agent to make California Requests on your behalf.
We do not discriminate against you.
You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Verve does not discriminate against California Residents for exercising their rights.
We do not sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.
Additional Information for European Residents
If you are situated in the European Union, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom, the following provisions will apply in addition to the Advertising and Data Services Privacy Policy to any Personal Information.
Data Controller
For purposes of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), Verve is the data controller of the Personal Information.
Legal Basis for Processing
We will process your Personal Information (a) for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by us in accordance with Art 6 para. 1 lit. (f) GDPR; or (b) because you have consented to the processing in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit (a) GDPR.
We will only process Personal Information based on our legitimate interests for storing and accessing Personal Information necessary to provide the Services; selecting, delivering and reporting on the effectiveness of advertisements; measuring the performance of advertisements and campaigns and investigating and preventing fraud.
Transferring your Information outside Europe
We transfer Personal Information from the European Union, the EEA and the United Kingdom, to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protection of the Personal Information.
If we transfer your personal information to a third-party service provider outside the European Union, the EEA or the United Kingdom we are responsible for such transfer and we will impose obligations on the recipients of that Personal Information to protect your data to the standard required in the GDPR.
Rights under the GDPR
You have the following rights: (a) you have the right to obtain information about the data processed about you (Art. 15 GDPR); (b) if inaccurate personal data is processed, you have a right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR); (c) if the legal requirements are met, you may request the erasion or restriction of processing as well as object to processing (Art. 17, 18, 21 GDPR); (d) if you have consented to the data processing or a contract for data processing exists and the data processing is carried out with the help of automated procedures, you may have a right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR).
We generally do not associate Personal Information (such as device history) with identified individuals as we generally do not have information such as names or email addresses connected to device information. Therefore, we will need your Advertiser Identifier to fulfill your rights. If you do not provide us with the required information, we will be unable to ensure your rights.

Our Privacy Principles for the use of data about Targeted End Users
Liftoff’s systems aggregate events/data at granularities that cover many users, as opposed to a specific user, unless the user consents. For instance: users with iPhone X’s in San Francisco have clicked on ads in app A 100 times and installed app B 50 times.
Liftoff does not tie together events/data across apps in a user-specific way, without the user’s consent. For instance: we do not track that a person did X in app A and also Y in app B from a different publisher, if the person opts-out of interest-based advertising.
Instead, Liftoff only ties events/data from a given specific user within the context of a given app. E.g. user with app-local ID 123 installed app A, then finished the tutorial, then made a purchase.
This allows Liftoff to understand the conversion rates from one event to another within an app, but not track the activities of a user across different apps.
Liftoff does not record or store personal information that the user cannot easily revoke, such as email address, physical address, photographs or phone number to personalize our advertising. Liftoff relies upon device IDs to uniquely identify a user, and Liftoff solely relies upon the user’s consent in allowing Liftoff to access this information.
Liftoff does not export per-user data outside of Liftoff, except for validation purposes to a company that already has access to that data

V. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Your personal information may be collected, transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located, including the United States and other countries where we or our group companies or service providers (among others) maintain facilities. Our group affiliates and our third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. We maintain primary data centers in the United States, Singapore, Japan and Germany. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Privacy Policy and according to applicable law.
We have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, including by entering into the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal information, or where required, we will ask you for your prior written consent for such international data transfers.
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland which have been formally recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” and “adequacy regulations” from the European Commission, Swiss and UK authorities.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision, we take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. These safeguards include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021 under Article 46(2) GDPR for transfers originating in the EEA, UK and Switzerland; and the UK Addendum under Article 46(2) of the UK GDPR for the transfer of data originating in the UK.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses entered into by our group companies and with our third-party service providers and partners can be provided on request. Please note that some sensitive commercial information will be redacted. If you have any questions or concerns related to international data transfers, please contact us via the contact details set out below.

VI. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHO WE SHARE IT WITH
We do not sell your personal information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we do share your personal information with third parties as described below. If you have consented to us sharing your personal information but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.
Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You will be able to recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is necessary and related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies. This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information that we collect through the Site and Services. If you have any questions about these practices, please contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
Service Providers
We employ third party companies and people, for example cloud service providers (“Third Party Service Providers”), such as Amazon Web Services, Dropbox, Salesforce and
Unity Technologies
to perform tasks e.g., provide computer and network infrastructure services on our behalf or as advertising exchange partners and we may need to share your information with them to provide products or Services to you. We only share your personal information with Third Party Service Providers to the extent necessary for them to assist us and they do not have any right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We may also work with Google to deliver the best advertising opportunities to its clients through the use of remarketing tags. Traffic Clients and other data subjects can consult Google’s policies to learn more about Google’s processing policies
here
.
Third Party Digital Advertising Partners
If you are a Targeted End User, we will share data about you with Partners, to be used by those Partners for advertising-related purposes, including establishing (on behalf of advertisers) whether to bid on the opportunity to show you ads. When we share data in this manner, we will also share with the relevant Partner details about whether you have consented to, or objected to, the use of your data by the Partner for specified purposes.
Group Companies
We may provide your personal information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf to provide the Site and the Services to you. These parties are required to process such information based on our instructions and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. They do not have any independent right to share this information.
Compliance with laws and legal proceedings
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
Merger or Acquisition
If Liftoff Mobile, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
VII. SECURITY
The security of your personal information is important to us.  Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us
We take appropriate steps to pseudonymize your personal information. For Targeted End Users, the advertising device IDs (which are the only per-user identifiers that we track, and can be reset by the user at any time) are SHA1-hashed before insertion. Since SHA1 is a one-way hashing algorithm, the original raw advertising device ID cannot be reverse-engineered from the hashed version.
If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
VIII. DATA RETENTION
If you have provided us with personal information for the purposes of holding an account with us, we will retain your information (including personal information) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.
If we hold information about you through any other means we shall only process this information for as long as is necessary for the purpose and in any event for no longer than 28 days.
Information relating to Targeted End Users is retained for 30 days in pseudonymized form before it is automatically deleted from our active database. Backups are stored indefinitely.
We will delete it after the timescales stated above, except we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
IX. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
We perform the following automated decision-making processes using your personal information:
To build lookalike targeting models to target users who are similar to the Customer’s existing users. Our Machine Learning does this automatically for every Customer. The more upfront device IDs Liftoff has, the more beneficial this is.
For power predictive ML features e.g. users who have purchased in the past are much more likely to purchase again in the future
To exclude existing users from User Acquisition campaigns, and power targeting rules for re-engagement campaigns e.g. target users who have registered but not purchased.
We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal data is subject to automated decision-making. Our technical and organizational security measures can be provided on request.
When we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contacting us using the contact details provided under Section IV titled “Complaints, Questions and Suggestions”.

GIPHY PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: June 11, 2024
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the policies and procedures of Giphy, Inc. (“we”, “our” or “us”) regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your information in connection with your use of www.giphy.com (the “Site”), our mobile applications, and the services, features, or content we offer (collectively with the Site, our “Services”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for an account on our Services, through your user account (your “Account”); (ii) your use of our Services generally; and (iii) from third-party websites and services. When you use our Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of your personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) gathered when you are using or accessing our Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Data that our business partners disclose to us or that we disclose to our business partners.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third-party websites, services and applications (each a “Third-Party Service”) that you elect to access through our Services or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third-Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third-Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Services you access.
What Personal Data Do We Collect About You?
We collect Personal Data about you when you provide it directly to us, when third parties, such as our business partners or service providers, provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Services.  The Personal Data we gather enables us to improve, understand, and continue to operate our Services. In connection with certain aspects of our Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Data. Below explains in greater detail the types of Personal Data that we collect about our users.
Personal Data You Provide to Us
Account Information:
If you create an Account, register for a brand or artist channel, register for a verified user profile, or have registered for Electric Objects, you will provide information that could be Personal Data, such as: your email address, username, password, and art preferences (for Electric Objects). You may also choose to provide additional Personal Data, including an avatar/profile picture, display name, contact name, information about yourself (including basic demographic information), a description of your channel, a brand parent company (brand or artist channel), location (brand or artist channel), your Giphy Channel URL (for verified user profile), attachments to your application (for verified user profile), and links to your website or social media profiles.
Additionally, if you register for or access our Services using a Third-Party Service (such as your social media account login credentials), we may receive Personal Data that you have made available to share through such Third-Party Service, such as your name and your email address.  You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account and providing Personal Data to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your Account information to provide you with our Services and to send you communications about our Services.
User Content:
Some features of our Services allow you to provide content to our Services and related Personal Data if you so choose (together, “User Content”). User Content includes GIFs, written comments, links, and pictures. After you terminate your Account or your access to our Services is terminated, we may retain and continue to use and disclose certain User Content (e.g., a GIF you provided that was subsequently shared by another user) and related data (e.g., technical specifications of a GIF) in a manner that does not reveal Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Policy.
Personal Data From Others
As mentioned above, you may be able to register for or access our Services using a Third-Party Service, such as your social media account (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.).  Occasionally, you can also use your Account on our Services to interact with your accounts on these other Third-Party Services. For example, you may be able to access posting and sharing tools on our Services that allow you to post information to your social networks outside of our Services.  By using these tools or Third-Party Services, you acknowledge that some Personal Data and other information (such as your IP address, language preferences, timestamp, and identifiers related to your request) may be transmitted to us, and that such information and content is covered by this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, if a tool is operated by a Third-Party Service, the Third-Party Service that operates the tool may collect information about your browser or online activity, which would be subject to the Third-Party Service’s privacy policy and your account settings selected through that Third-Party Service. When you use these tools, some of your information from our Services may be shared with the Third-Party Service and others, including selected GIFs.  Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policies and other policies of any Third-Party Services, including without limitation any applicable social networks, that you use in connection with our Services.
Personal Data Collected Automatically
We automatically receive and record Personal Data from your web browser or device when you interact with our Services, including when you search for, select, view, or receive a GIF.Information that we collect automatically includes your IP address, device ID, user query information, and cookie information. This information is used to enable us to deliver GIFs to you, to fight spam/malware, to improve the service, and to facilitate collection of Personal Data concerning your interaction with our Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).
Generally, our Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site and our Services. We may use this data in aggregate form, for example, as a statistical measure or in other anonymous forms, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables both us and third parties authorized by us to determine how often individuals use parts of our Services so that we can analyze and improve them.
Information Collected Using Cookies
•
Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer or device through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We may use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use our Services.
•
Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Data. However, we may match cookies with your Personal Data to identify you, and we may use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of our Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.
•
We may allow third-party web analytics service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your use of our Services. We use Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) to help us understand how users use the Services and to enhance your experience when you use our Services. For more information on Google’s privacy practices, please go to
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
. To opt out of data recording and analysis by Google Analytics on the Services, please visit

.
•
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. Leaving cookies active will enable us to improve your user experience and analyze website traffic. If you choose not to accept these cookies, some of the features of the Services may not work.
•
This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or device. For example, third-party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer or device. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Services that you access to better understand how they use cookies or other tracking technologies.
Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons:
To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users, including using your IP address to send you geographically-targeted advertisements, and may come from third party companies called "ad networks." Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We may also receive anonymized user data from our Agents (defined below), so we can learn and make enhancements to offer you a better experience. Some of these entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, tailor the Services to you (for example, by providing search results in your preferred language), analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.
Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Data , may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Data to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.
To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
We may also collect advertising identifiers from your mobile device. Advertising identifiers are resettable identifiers unique to your mobile device, and which are used in connection with advertising delivered to your mobile device. The IDFA (developed by Apple, Inc. for the iPhone) and Google Ad ID (developed by Google for Android) are examples of advertising identifiers.
Aggregate Information
We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use our Services (“Aggregate Information”). While some of this information is derived from Personal Data, the Aggregate Information itself is not Personal Data and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, or your web browser.
Personal Data of Children

How, and With Whom, Is My Personal Data Disclosed?
Our Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the Personal Data generated through our Services is displayed publicly or disclosed to Third-Party Services. What Personal Data is disclosed depends on your privacy settings. Below further describes the ways in which we may disclose your information. We do not sell your Personal Data.
Publicly Displayed Data About You, and Your Activity on the Services
User profile and channel information that you choose to provide, including your username, contact name, GIFs you upload, information about yourself, your avatar/profile picture, a description of your channel, and links to your website or social media profiles, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within our Services. This information will be displayed to other users depending on your privacy settings. We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other users.
Some of your activity on and through our Services is publicly displayed by default. This includes User Content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through our Services. For registered users, all User Content you post publicly (or privately) will be associated with your account. Unregistered users will not have this association, but Personal Data concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked through the use of cookies and stored by us.
Please remember that if you choose to provide Personal Data using certain public features of our Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in User Content that you create or information that you submit through our Services.
Personal Data Disclosed Through Third-Party Services
You may access other Third-Party Services through our Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third-Party Services from within our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third-Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third-Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs Personal Data collected on our Services.
Personal Data Disclosed In Connection with Related Services
While we collect and store IP address and device ID information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, disclose this information to our service providers and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.
We also share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.
Personal Data Disclosed to Our Service Providers
We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and whose processing is under our control (our “service providers”). We may need to share Personal Data with our service providers in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our service providers do not have any right to use Personal Data or other information we disclose to them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You acknowledge we may share Personal Data with our service providers as described in this Privacy Policy.
Personal Data Disclosed Pursuant to a Change in Control or Sale
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, Personal Data is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Data would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Personal Data Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others
We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Data as we reasonably believe is necessary to: (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service and other relevant terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users, and the public. This includes exchanging Personal Data with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Personal Data?
Access and Control Your Personal Data
•
If you are a registered user, you can access Personal Data associated with your Account by logging into our Services. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.
•
You can use many of the features of our Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of Personal Data that we collect.
•
You can always opt not to provide certain Personal Data to us, but please note that such information may be needed to take advantage of some of our features.
•
You can opt-out of certain cookies and tracking technologies by following the steps set forth in the section titled “Information Collected Using Cookies” above.
•
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites, web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. We do not acknowledge this signal.
Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising
•
Through the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt out pages, which are located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or www.aboutads.info/choices.
•
Reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier or set it to opt out of targeted advertising.
•
iOS: You can opt-out of targeted advertising by choosing “Limit Ad Tracking” in your device’s settings menu.
•
Android: You can reset your advertising ID at any time from the Ads section under Settings on your device, or you can also opt-out of targeting advertising in this same section.
We want you to know that by opting-out of targeted advertising does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising, but just that the advertising that you do receive will not be customized to you and may feel less relevant to you.
Delete Your Account
Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by following the instructions
here
.  If you have trouble deleting your Account, please reach out to us at
support@giphy.com
. If you terminate your Account, any association between your Account and Personal Data we store will no longer be accessible through your Account. However, given the nature of public display used on our Services, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.
How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?
We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open Account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you Services.  In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule, or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form, but not in a way that would identify you personally.
Is the Information About Me Secure?
Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Data by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account.
We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. We store all of our Personal Data, including your IP address information, using industry-standard techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Data or otherwise. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of Personal Data at any time.
What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Services or by sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses our Services after such changes have been first posted.
What If I Have Questions or Concerns?
If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using our Services, please send us a detailed message to
support@giphy.com
. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
EU or UK users
If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.
For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage, and disclosure.  We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with our Services. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at
support@giphy.com
.
We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity, and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.  The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them.

We process the following categories of Personal Data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties (which is not overridden by your data protection interests):
•
IP Address

•
Operation and improvement of our business, products, and services

• Other Processing Grounds:
From time to time, we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
• Personal Data of Children:
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for our Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us.  If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

for more information or to file a complaint, at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for complaints not resolved by other means.  You may opt out of having your personal information be disclosed to a third party or having it be used for any purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. In addition, as described above in the section titled "What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Personal Data?"

Unsere Netzwerksicherheitsarchitektur besteht aus mehreren Sicherheitszonen. Die sensibelsten Systeme, wie Datenbankserver, werden in unseren Zonen mit dem höchsten Vertrauensgrad geschützt. Andere Systeme werden in Zonen gemäß ihrer Sensibilität je nach Funktion, Informationsklassifizierung und Risiko gehostet. Je nach Zone finden zusätzliche Sicherheitsüberwachungen und Zugangskontrollen Anwendung. DMZs werden zwischen dem Internet und intern zwischen den unterschiedlichen Zonen des Vertrauens eingesetzt.
Prüfungen von Netzwerkschwachstellen
Anhand von Netzwerksicherheitsprüfungen können wir nichtkonforme oder potenziell anfällige Systeme schnell identifizieren.
Penetrationsprüfungen durch Drittanbieter

Sicherheitsvorfallverwaltung
Unser Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) System erfasst Protokolle von wichtigen Netzwerkgeräten und Host-Systemen. Das SIEM-System löst Warnungen aus und informiert das Sicherheitsteam über relevante Ereignisse, damit es diese untersuchen und entsprechend reagieren kann.
Erkennung von Eindringlingen und Vorbeugung
Die wichtigsten Ein- und Ausgangspunkte sind instrumentiert und werden auf Verhaltensanomalien hin überwacht. Die Systeme sind so konfiguriert, dass Alarme ausgelöst werden, wenn Vorfälle und Werte die festgelegten Schwellen überschreiten, und verwenden regelmäßig aktualisierte Signaturen, die auf neuen Bedrohungen basieren. Dies umfasst die Systemüberwachung rund um die Uhr.
Bedrohungsinformationsprogramm
Zendesk beteiligt sich an verschiedenen Programmen zur Weitergabe von Bedrohungsinformationen. Wir überwachen Bedrohungen, die in diesen Bedrohungsinformationsnetzwerken veröffentlicht werden, und ergreifen risikobasierte Maßnahmen.
DDos-Minimierung
Zendesk hat einen mehrstufigen Ansatz für die DDoS-Minimierung entwickelt. Die Partnerschaft mit Cloudflare zu Kerntechnologien bietet Schutz für Netzwerkränder, während die Nutzung der Skalierungs- und Schutztools von AWS zusammen mit unserer Nutzung der DDoS-spezifischen Leistungen von AWS tiefergehenden Schutz bietet.
Logischer Zugriff
Der Zugriff zum Zendesk-Produktionsnetzwerk ist unter strikter Anwendung des „Need-to-know“-Prinzips beschränkt, wobei die Zugriffrechte stets im geringstmöglichen Umfang gewährt werden, eine regelmäßige Überprüfung und Überwachung erfolgt und das Produktionsnetzwerk durch unser Operations Team kontrolliert wird. Wenn Mitarbeiter auf das Zendesk Production Network zugreifen, sind mehrere Authentifizierungsfaktoren erforderlich.
Reaktion auf Sicherheitsvorfälle
Im Falle eines Systemalarms werden die Ereignisse an unsere rund um die Uhr verfügbaren Teams eskaliert, die Unterstützung in den Bereichen Betrieb, Netzwerktechnik und Sicherheit bieten. Mitarbeiter werden in Bezug auf die Reaktion auf Sicherheitsvorfälle geschult, u. a. Kommunikationskanäle und Eskalationswege.
Verschlüsselung von verschobenen Daten
Die gesamte Kommunikation mit der Zendesk-Benutzeroberfläche und APIs wird per Branchenstandard HTTPS/TLS (TLS 1.2 oder höher) über öffentliche Netzwerke verschlüsselt. So wird sichergestellt, dass der gesamt Datenverkehr zwischen Ihnen und Zendesk sicher verläuft. Für E-Mails nutzt unser Produkt zudem standardmäßig Opportunistic TLS. Transport Layer Security (TLS) verschlüsselt E-Mails und sorgt für sicheren Versand. So werden Abhörmöglichkeiten zwischen Mailservern gemindert, wenn Peer-Services dieses Protokoll unterstützen. Zu den Ausnahmen bei der Verschlüsselung können die Verwendung von produktinternen SMS-Funktionen bzw. Apps oder Integrationen von Drittanbietern zählen. Zudem können Service-Abonnenten sie nach eigenem Ermessen nutzen.
Verschlüsselung von gespeicherten Daten
Gespeicherte Service-Daten werden in AWS per AES-256 verschlüsselt.
Verfügbarkeit
Zendesk unterhält eine öffentlich zugängliche
Systemstatus-Webseite
, die Details zur Systemverfügbarkeit, geplanten Wartungsarbeiten, der Historie von Servicevorfällen und relevanten Sicherheitsereignissen enthält.
Redundanz
Zendesk verwendet Service-Clustering und Netzwerkredundanzen zur Eliminierung einzelner Ausfallpunkte. Unser strenges Backup-System und/oder unser Serviceangebot für
Erweiterte Notfallwiederherstellung
ermöglichen es uns, ein hohes Maß an Serviceverfügbarkeit zu gewährleisten, da die Servicedaten über Verfügbarkeitszonen hinweg repliziert werden.
Notfallwiederherstellung
Unser
Notfallwiederherstellungsprogramm (Disaster Recovery, DR)
stellt sicher, dass unsere Dienste im Falle einer Katastrophe verfügbar bleiben und leicht wiederhergestellt werden können.
Dies wird durch eine robuste technische Umgebung, Disaster-Recovery-Pläne und
Tests
erreicht.
Erweitertes Disaster Recovery
Unser
Erweitertes Notfallwiederherstellungs-
Paket fügt vertragliche Ziele für Recovery Time Objective (RTO) und Recovery Point Objective (RPO) hinzu. Diese werden durch unsere Fähigkeit unterstützt, den Betrieb von Abonnenten des erweiterten Notfallwiederherstellungspakets während eines erklärten Katastrophenereignisses zu priorisieren.

Willkommen zum globalen Datenschutzprogramm von Zendesk
Zendesk unterhält eine formales globales Datenschutzprogramm, das funktionsübergreifende Hauptakteure, darunter die für Rechts-, Sicherheits-, Produkt- und Unternehmungsführungsangelegenheiten zuständigen Sektoren im Unternehmen, einschließt. Als Verfechter des Datenschutzes arbeiten wir unermüdlich daran, die Sicherheit unserer Dienste zu gewährleisten, und unsere Mitarbeiter unternehmen erhebliche Anstrengungen zur Einhaltung der geltenden aufsichtsrechtlichen und brancheninternen Regelwerke.
Compliance
Das australische Datenschutzgesetz (Privacy Act of 1998) in seiner jeweils gültigen Fassung regelt verschiedene Rechts betroffener Personen und fügte eine Meldepflicht für bestimmte Verletzung der Datensicherheit hinzu. Im Gegensatz zur DSGVO gibt es hier nicht die Begriffe Verantwortliche für die Verarbeitung und Auftragsverarbeitende.
https://www.zendesk.de/company/anz-privacy/
Das brasilianische Datenschutzgesetz („Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais“ oder „LGPD“) ist am 18 September 2020 in Kraft getreten. Das LGPD ist ein umfassendes Datenschutzgesetz, das die Tätigkeiten von Verantwortlichen und Auftragsverarbeitern sowie die Rechte betroffener Personen regelt.
Zendesk-Abonnenten, die personenbezogene Daten in Zendesk-Diensten erheben und speichern, können gemäß dem brasilianischen Datenschutzgesetz (LGPD) als „Verantwortliche“ eingestuft werden. Die für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen tragen die Hauptverantwortung dafür, dass ihre Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten mit den einschlägigen Datenschutzgesetzen, einschließlich des LGPD, übereinstimmt. Zendesk handelt als ein „Auftragsverarbeiter“ entsprechend der Definition dieses Begriffs im LGPD hinsichtlich der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten durch unsere Dienste.
Abonnenten können unsere
Product Guides (Produktleitfäden)
und unsere
Service Data Deletion Policy (Richtlinie zur Löschung von Servicedaten)
für ausführlichere Informationen in Hinblick auf die Nutzung von Zendesk-Produkten unter Beachtung von Compliance-Initiativen einsehen. Die brasilianische Datenschutzbehörde, die Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (ANPD), kann in der Zukunft zusätzliche Leitlinien zum LGPD erlassen. Zendesk wird die Entwicklung des Gesetzes weiterhin aktiv verfolgen. Wir werden unsere Abonnenten auch in Zukunft über die Funktionen auf dem Laufenden halten, die sie zur Unterstützung ihrer Compliance-Bemühungen nutzen können.

Der
California Consumer Privacy Act
, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 et seq. („CCPA“), ist ein durch den Bundesstaat Kalifornien verabschiedetes US-Gesetz, das am 1. Januar 2020 in Kraft trat. Es regelt die bestimmten kalifornischen Verbrauchern zur Verfügung stehenden Datenschutzrechte und verlangt von bestimmten Unternehmen, dass jene verschiedene Datenschutzauflagen einhalten. Bitte lesen Sie dazu auch die
CCPA Regulations
in ihrer endgültigen Fassung und den
California Privacy Rights Act
(„CPRA“). Einige CPRA-Bestimmungen traten am 16. Dezember 2020 in Kraft, die übrigen Bestimmungen des CPRA werden zum 1. Januar 2023 in Kraft treten.
Zendesk-Abonnenten, die personenbezogene Daten in Zendesk-Diensten erheben und speichern, können gemäß dem CCPA als „Unternehmen“ eingestuft werden. Unternehmen tragen die Hauptverantwortung dafür, dass ihre Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten mit den einschlägigen Datenschutzgesetzen, einschließlich des CCPA, übereinstimmt. Zendesk handelt in Bezug auf die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten durch unsere Dienste als „Dienstanbieter“, wie dieser Begriff in der aktuellen Fassung des CCPA definiert ist. Daher erhebt, nutzt, verarbeitet und übermittelt Zendesk die personenbezogenen Daten unserer Abonnenten und der Endbenutzer unserer Abonnenten, die über die Dienste verarbeitet werden, ausschließlich zum Zweck der Erfüllung unserer Verpflichtungen aus unseren bestehenden Verträgen mit unseren Abonnenten und zu keinem anderen kommerziellen Zweck als der Erfüllung dieser Verpflichtungen und der Verbesserung der von uns angebotenen Dienste.
Wir „verkaufen“ keinerlei personenbezogene Daten unserer Abonnenten, wie im Rahmen des CCPA definiert. Wir können gesammelte und/oder anonymisierte Informationen über die Nutzung des/der Dienste(s), die nicht als personenbezogene Daten im Sinne des CCPA gelten, an Dritte weitergeben, damit wir die Dienste weiterentwickeln und verbessern und unseren Abonnenten relevantere Inhalte und Dienstleistungsangebote zur Verfügung stellen können, wie in unseren Abonnentenvereinbarungen festgelegt.

Seit unserer Gründung ist der Ansatz von Zendesk von einem starken Engagement für Datenschutz, Sicherheit, Compliance und Transparenz geprägt. Dieser Ansatz umfasst die Unterstützung unserer Abonnenten in Hinblick auf die Einhaltung der EU-Datenschutzauflagen, wie sie etwa in der
Datenschutz-Grundverordnung
(„DSGVO“) festgelegt sind.
Wenn ein Abonnent personenbezogene Daten von EU-Bürgern erhebt, übermittelt, hostet oder analysiert, verlangt die DSGVO, dass der Abonnent externe Auftragsverarbeiter nutzt, die ihre Fähigkeit zur Implementierung der durch die DSGVO vorgesehenen technischen und organisatorischen Vorgaben garantieren können. Als weitere vertrauensbildende Maßnahme in Bezug auf die Abonnenten wurde unserer Vertrag über Auftragsverarbeitung („AV-Vertrag“) aktualisiert, sodass unsere Kunden vertragliche Zusicherungen in Hinblick auf das geltende EU-Datenschutzrecht und zur Implementierung zusätzlicher vertraglicher Bestimmungen erhalten, die durch die DSGVO verlangt werden.
Verbindliche interne Datenschutzvorschriften (VID)
: Verbindliche interne Datenschutzvorschriften („VID“) sind durch europäische Datenschutzbehörden genehmigte unternehmensweite Datenschutzrichtlinien für die Durchführung von Übermittlungen personenbezogener Daten innerhalb von Konzernen aus dem Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum („EWR“) in Länder außerhalb des EWR. Die VID beruhen auf den strengen Datenschutzgrundsätzen, die durch die Datenschutzbehörden der Europäischen Union etabliert wurden, und erfordern eine intensive Konsultation mit diesen Behörden. Abonnent:innen können die vollständige Liste von Unternehmen mit entsprechenden Genehmigungen auf der Binding Corporate Rules Approved List
hier
abrufen. Im Jahr 2017 schloss Zendesk das EU-Genehmigungsverfahren in Bezug auf die durch den irischen Data Protection Commissioner („DPC“) geprüften VID (mit Peer-Review durch das britische Information Commissioner’s Office und die niederländische Datenschutzbehörde) für die Rollen als Auftragsverarbeiter und als Verantwortlicher für die Verarbeitung ab. Diese wichtige behördliche Genehmigung bestätigt, dass Zendesk weltweit die höchstmöglichen Standards für den Schutz personenbezogener Daten implementiert hat, und zwar sowohl für die personenbezogenen Daten seiner Kunden als auch seiner Mitarbeiter. Zendesk ist eines der ersten Softwareunternehmen weltweit, das eine Genehmigung für seine VID erhalten hat, und war das zweite Unternehmen überhaupt, das eine Genehmigung von der irischen DPC erhielt.

Zendesk KI
Zendesk-KI basiert in ihrem Design auf den Grundprinzipien von Datenschutz, Sicherheit und Compliance. Unsere Mission, Unternehmen mit sicheren und zuverlässigen Produkten und Lösungen auszustatten, liegt in unserer DNA. Im Zuge dessen hat Zendesk eine Reihe von
Designprinzipien
aufgestellt. Diese bilden nicht nur einen Standard für das Design, die Entwicklung und den Aufbau unserer Produkte, sondern auch eine Grundlage für den Einsatz generativer KI für die Kundenerfahrung (CX) und Mitarbeitererfahrung (EX).
Von Zendesk AI verarbeitete Servicedaten unterliegen allen Sicherheitsstandards und -verpflichtungen, einschließlich der Einhaltung der robusten
Unternehmenssicherheitsmaßnahmen
von Zendesk und der Speicherung in der
SOC 2-konformen Umgebung von Zendesk
. Servicedaten werden nicht an andere Kunden weitergegeben.
Generative KI-Funktionen werden derzeit von OpenAI unterstützt. OpenAI löscht alle Daten nach der Ausgabe ohne Speicher. Die Datensicherheitspraktiken von OpenAI finden Sie

Nutzt Zendesk Kundendienstdaten, um Modelle für maschinelles Lernen zu trainieren?
Zendesk bietet drei Arten von Funktionen für maschinelles Lernen:
1. Kontospezifische ML-Funktionalität:
Zendesk erstellt maschinelle Lernmodelle, die auf das Konto eines Kunden zugeschnitten sind, indem nur Daten verwendet werden, die im Konto vorhanden sind. Kundenspezifische Modelle werden von keinem anderen Kunden verwendet.
2. Generische ML-Funktionalität:
Zendesk verwendet Servicedaten, um seine generischen, kontoübergreifenden maschinellen Lernmodelle so zu trainieren, dass sie für mehrere Zendesk-Kunden vorausschauend und nützlich sind. Dazu gehören globale und Branchenmodelle. Diese Modelle werden niemals die Servicedaten eines Kunden an einen anderen Kunden weitergeben, da sie nicht „generativ“ sind (d. h. sie erstellen keinen Text).
3. Generative ML-Funktionalität, unterstützt von OpenAI:
OpenAI-Modelle sind vorab geschult und Zendesk-Kundendaten werden niemals von OpenAI (oder einem anderen Dritten) verwendet, um ihr/e Modell(e) zu trainieren.
Wie schützt Zendesk Servicedaten, wenn sie für Modellschulungen verwendet werden?
Bevor Service-Daten zur Schulung einer allgemein verfügbaren ML-Funktionalität verwendet werden, wendet Zendesk je nach Bedarf Aggregations- und Bereinigungsprozesse an. Felder, die für die Aufnahme personenbezogener Daten oder Ticketanhänge verwendet werden, fließen nicht in die Trainingsdaten ein.
Zendesk stellt sicher, dass durch das Modell keine Servicedaten reproduziert werden.
Es besteht kein Risiko, dass die Daten eines Kunden durch die Ausgabe des Modells einem anderen Kunden ausgesetzt werden.
Siehe
KI-Datennutzungsinformationen.
Halluzinationen sind ein grundsätzliches Risiko für alle Funktionen, die auf generativer KI beruhen. Zendesk tut zwei Dinge, um dieses Risiko zu mindern:
Zendesk nutzt die RAG-Technik (Retrieval Augmented Generation), um sicherzustellen, dass generierte Antworten oder Suchergebnisse auf bestimmten Inhalten der Wissensdatenbank basieren
Das Zendesk-Entwicklungsteam überprüft regelmäßig Antworten mit negativem Endbenutzerfeedback auf Halluzinationen, um Tools zu entwickeln, die solche Szenarien automatisch erkennen und verhindern können.
Alle Servicedaten werden in den bestehenden
AWS-Regionen
von Zendesk gehostet. Die Hosting-Standorte von Unterauftragsverarbeitern finden Sie in der
Unterauftragsverarbeiter-Richtlinie von Zendesk
.
Die Nutzung von Zendesk-KI hat keine Auswirkungen auf die Verpflichtungen des Abonnenten in Bezug auf die Datenlokalisierung, einschließlich derer, die im
Data Center Location Add-on
verfügbar sind. Die Servicedaten der berechtigten Abonnenten werden weiterhin in der ausgewählten Region gehostet.
Hinweis: Zendesk WFM (Tymeshift), Zendesk QA (Klaus) und Ultimate Service Data werden in der Google Cloud Platform in den unten angegebenen Regionen gehostet:
USA, Deutschland

Alle Zendesk-Produkte und -Funktionen werden unter Berücksichtigung des Datenschutzes entwickelt, genauso wie die Zendesk KI.
Abonnenten können bei der Verwendung von Zendesk, einschließlich der Zendesk KI-Funktionen, verschiedene Datenschutzgesetze (einschließlich DSGVO und CCPA)
einhalten
.
Die Zendesk KI kann im Rahmen des
Business Associate Agreement (BAA) von Zendesk
abgedeckt werden.
Abonnenten, die ein BAA mit Zendesk abschließen möchten, müssen Zugriff auf das

Datensicherheit
Die Datensicherheitspraktiken von OpenAI finden Sie

.
Sicherheit von Modellen
Zendesk verwendet vorab trainierte OpenAI-Modelle, und die Servicedaten werden von OpenAI zu keinem anderen Zweck als zur Bereitstellung und Sicherung des Dienstes für den Abonnenten verwendet. Sobald die Ausgabe geliefert wurde, werden die Servicedaten gelöscht.
Training von Modellen
OpenAI wird Servicedaten niemals zum Training von Modellen oder für eine andere Form der Service-Verbesserung verwenden.
Datenhosting und Lokalität
Für berechtigte Kund:innen unterstützt OpenAI Datenverarbeitungsstandorte im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum (EWR) und in der Schweiz. Bitte beachten Sie jedoch, dass OpenAI keine Servicedaten speichert oder hostet. Deren Verarbeitung findet nur im Speicher statt, damit die Ausgabe bereitgestellt werden kann.
Datenschutz
Zendesk folgt der „Zero Data Retention"-Richtlinie von OpenAI, sodass keine Servicedaten gespeichert oder von OpenAI gehostet werden, nachdem die Ausgabedaten übermittelt wurden. Daher hat die Verwendung von OpenAI keine Auswirkungen auf die Fähigkeit von Abonnenten, bei der Nutzung von Zendesk verschiedene Datenschutzgesetze (einschließlich GDPR und CCPA)
einzuhalten
.
Alle OpenAI-Funktionen in Zendesk sind optional. Abonnenten, die diese Funktionen nicht nutzen möchten, müssen sie nicht aktivieren oder können sie jederzeit über die Funktionen des Admin Centers deaktivieren.
HIPAA
Ausgewählte OpenAI-gestützte Funktionen sind für die Verwendung mit HIPAA-fähigen Konten verfügbar. Weitere Informationen finden Sie auf der Seite
Erweiterte Compliance
