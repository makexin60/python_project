Pixel tags, also known as tracking pixels, web beacons or clear GIFs, are tools used to transmit information to our service providers’ or partners' servers. When you visit a website or open an email that contains a web beacon, that tool will instruct your browser to transmit information such as your IP address, device details, time of the activity, and nature of the activity (e.g., email read, web pages visited) to us. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and to improve our websites. They also enable partners to compile information about your browsing activity on the websites for personalization and online targeted advertising. If you exercise your rights to tell us not to share your information or not to use your information for online targeted advertising, we will refrain from placing pixel tags on your browser.
Our websites may use other tracking methods.
Our websites may use other types of tracking and analytics tools, such as keystroke analytics. These tools allow us to recognize devices, even if you have rejected cookies, but they are only used for security and fraud detection purposes. For example, we use these tools to detect bots and other threats. We do not sell or share the information collected using these tools, and we do not use this information for online targeted advertising.
Our websites collect personal information using Server Logs.
A server log is a text file that records activities on our web services. When you visit a website, we log the date and time of your visit, the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. Our server logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to Ping Identity and the website you visit after you leave our site. We use this information in aggregate, such as to analyze website traffic patterns and to better understand website user behavior generally. We also use the information for security purposes, to detect threats, and for fraud prevention. For example, we may block login attempts coming from countries where we do not do business. We do not sell or share the information collected by our logs, and we do not use this information for online targeted advertising.
Our websites use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics.
Analytics services help us understand how people use our websites. In some cases, these services are provided by companies that act as service providers for us, meaning that they do not use the information collected for their own purposes. In other cases, the company may combine information collected from users of our websites with information collected from other websites. You have the right to opt-out of having your data combined by these third parties. You can use our Cookie Management Platform to reject all non-necessary cookies. If you exercise your rights to tell us not to sell/share your information for online targeted advertising, we will also refrain from placing third party cookies on your browser.
