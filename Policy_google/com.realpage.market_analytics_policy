RealPage may provide personal information to third parties for business purposes under limited circumstances, including service providers and vendors that support or integrate with the RealPage Services described in this policy (see “Disclosure” column in the chart below). RealPage only discloses personal information to the extent reasonably necessary to support RealPage Services requirements, or for the third-party vendors or service providers to perform the services on our or our Clients’ behalf. We do not permit third party vendors or service providers to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.

is collected (i) from Client’s employees during setup of RealPage Services user accounts, (ii) from Client during activation and implementation of RealPage Services; and (iii) from website analytics software and services integrated with RealPage Services.
V.	Personal Information Use & Processing
In providing the suite of RealPage Services, RealPage primarily acts as a service provider or data processor under contract to our Clients. As a service provider or data processor, RealPage does not control any of the personal information we process on behalf of our Clients. Our Clients are the data controllers who collect and control all such personal information, and RealPage is required to provide our products and services in accordance with Clients’ contractual provisions and instructions regarding data collection, privacy, processing, and security.
Accordingly, we may use or disclose the personal information we collect on behalf of our Clients for one or more of the following purposes:
To fulfill the purpose for which the personal information was collected and provide the requested RealPage Services.
To integrate with apartment community services offered by RealPage or third-party service providers contracted by Clients.
To distribute communications and legally required notices regarding the status of RealPage Services via phone, email, and SMS text
To provide RealPage Services maintenance, enhancement, research, development, security, support, and website optimization.
To maintain compliance with federal and state laws related to software-as-a-service, background screening, financial institutions, and money services businesses.
To create, maintain, customize, and secure RealPage Services user accounts.
To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
To exercise or defend legal claims.
To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of RealPage's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by RealPage is among the assets transferred.
RealPage will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice. Additionally, RealPage processing of sensitive personal information is limited to activities necessary for the delivery and performance of RealPage Services on behalf of our Clients and end users.
For information about how your property manager uses and discloses your personal information, please contact your property manager and/or refer to its privacy policy.
VI.	Personal Information Rights and Choices – State Privacy Rights
Certain state jurisdictions provide their legal residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. Each right includes the ability to make a specific consumer request and corresponding obligation of the receiving party to (i) verify the identity of the requestor and (ii) respond in accordance with statutory guidelines. This section describes your rights and, along with
Section VII
below, explains how to exercise those rights if you are a resident of one of these states.
PLEASE NOTE: Under most circumstances, any request regarding your privacy rights should be submitted to the
property manager
that operates your apartment community or rental property.
As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider or data processor for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information when we act in that capacity. Our role as a service provider or data processor is to assist our Clients, upon their request, in responding to requests submitted to them by consumers.
However, for our direct-to-consumer and other products identified in
Section I
, you may submit privacy rights requests in accordance with their respective privacy policies.
Accessing and Updating/Correcting Personal Information
You have the right to confirm whether a data controller is processing your personal data and, if so, to access such personal data. You may access and update or correct your information (as needed) by logging into your RealPage Services account or contacting your property manager. If you require verification that your requested changes have been completed, and such verification is not readily displayed in your RealPage Services account, you may request confirmation at the email address listed below (See
Section XVII
“Contact Us”).
Data Portability and Access to Specific Information Regarding Personal Information Collection, Use & Disclosure
You have the right to request a copy of the personal information collected about you in a readily useable format that is transferable to other entities, to the extent technically feasible (frequently known as “data portability”).  If you are a California resident, you also have the right to request a disclosure summarizing the collection, use, sale, sharing and disclosure to third parties of your personal information over the past 12 months. You can request a data copy or disclosure by contacting your property manager. If your request is verified and granted by your property manager, the personal information subject to the request will be produced in a portable format from our systems and transmitted to you by your property manager.
Deletion of Personal Information
You have the right to request the deletion of any of your personal information that was collected and retained in connection with RealPage Services, subject to certain exceptions. You can request data deletion by contacting your property manager. If your request is verified and granted by your property manager, the personal information subject to the request will be deleted or permanently de-identified in our systems. RealPage will not attempt to re-identify any personal information de-identified through this process or any other de-identified information in our possession
A verified deletion request may be denied if retaining the information is permitted under the applicable law and is reasonably necessary for your property manager, RealPage, or our service providers or contractors to
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide the RealPage Services requested or reasonably anticipated by you within the context of our or your ongoing business relationship with your property manager, or otherwise perform our contract with your property manager.
Help to ensure security and integrity to the extent the use of your personal information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for those purposes.
Debug RealPage Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise that consumer’s free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research that conforms or adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion  is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the ability to complete such research, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are: (i) reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with our Clients; and (ii) compatible with the context in which you provided the information.
Comply with laws, regulations, statutes, codes, ordinances, or other legal obligations.
VII.	How to Submit a Consumer Privacy Request
Under most circumstances, any request regarding your privacy rights should be submitted to the
property manager
that operates your apartment community or rental property.
As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider or data processor for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information when we act in that capacity. Our role as a service provider or data processor is to assist our Clients, upon their request, in responding to requests submitted to them by consumers.
However, for our direct-to-consumer products and the four other RealPage Services with separate privacy policies identified in
Section I
, you may submit privacy rights requests in accordance with their respective privacy policies.
Only you (or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf) may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
Certain state privacy laws may limit the number of requests for access and/or portability that you can make in a 12-month period (e.g., two under California law). Other states may require one free response per consumer in a 12-month period but allow the data controller to either decline to act on a request or charge a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of responding to requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows confirmation of your identity as the person whose personal information was collected (and, if applicable, the authority and identity of an authorized representative).
Describe your request with sufficient detail to allow the data controller to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
VIII. Consumer Request Responses and Timelines
If your property manager notifies RealPage of a verified and granted consumer request, we will endeavor to respond to the request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require additional time beyond the 45 days, we are entitled to an extension up to an additional 45 days (for a total response timeline capped at 90 days). In the event that an extension is necessary, we will inform your property manager of the reason and extension period in writing.
RealPage does not charge fees to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will notify your property manager why we made that decision and provide them with a cost estimate before completing your request.
If we are unable to assist the Client in the fulfillment of a verifiable consumer request, we will provide your property manager with an explanation of the reason(s) for our inability to do so. If the applicable state law affords you the right to appeal a denial, you may appeal the decision in accordance with the process established by your property manager.
IX. Personal Information Sales, Sharing, Targeted Advertising and Profiling – Opt Out Rights
RealPage does
not
sell personal information collected through RealPage Services or use such information for targeted advertising or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning consumers and no such activity has occurred in the prior 12 months.  Subject to the statements in the last paragraph of this section, RealPage does
not
share personal information collected through the RealPage Services for cross-contextual behavioral advertising and no such activity has occurred in the prior 12 months.
If RealPage changes its practices and engages in the sale or sharing of personal information or in targeted advertising or profiling as regulated by law, we will provide advance notification to impacted individuals and offer the ability to opt in/opt out in accordance with regulatory requirements.
RealPage utilizes cookies and tracking technologies as set forth in the
Cookie Policy
. Under some circumstances, these technologies may be deemed a “sharing” of personal information under applicable privacy laws. Where this is or may be the case, such as on our RealPage.com website, RealPage provides a
Cookies Settings
allow you to opt out and customize the cookies presented.
X. Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless permitted by law, we will not engage in any of the following practices in response to your exercise of privacy rights:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
XI. Other California Privacy Rights
California Employees, Applicants & Independent Contractors
– The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”) also prohibits businesses from retaliating against an employee, applicant for employment, or independent contractor for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
The State of California also grants California residents privacy rights via laws unaffiliated with the CCPA. Those rights include the following:
California's "Shine the Light" law (California Civil Code §1798.83)
permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@realpage.com.
California’s Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA – California Civil Code §§ 1786.10 -1786.40)
requires certain privacy disclosures related to investigative consumer reporting agencies’ operations, including the following:
Personal Information Disclosure: United States or Overseas
Personal information collected in connection with the provision of consumer reports and investigative consumer reports through our Resident Screening products (LeasingDesk and On-Site) is securely stored on servers located within the United States. This information may be made available to employees of RealPage or its affiliated companies who are located outside of the United States or its territories, solely for the purpose of performing their job duties and in accordance with applicable laws.

As a service provider or data processor, RealPage does not control any of the personal information we process on behalf of our Clients. Our Clients are the data controllers who collect and control all such personal information, and RealPage is required to provide our products and services in accordance with Clients’ contractual provisions and instructions regarding data collection, privacy, processing, and security.
Accordingly, we may use or disclose the personal information we collect on behalf of our Clients for one or more of the following purposes:
To fulfill the purpose for which the personal information was collected and provide the requested RealPage Services.
To integrate with apartment community services offered by RealPage or third-party service providers contracted by Clients.
To distribute communications and legally required notices regarding the status of RealPage Services via phone, email, and SMS text
To provide RealPage Services maintenance, enhancement, research, development, security, support, and website optimization.
To maintain compliance with federal and state laws related to software-as-a-service, background screening, financial institutions, and money services businesses.
To create, maintain, customize, and secure RealPage Services user accounts.
To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
To exercise or defend legal claims.
To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of RealPage's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by RealPage is among the assets transferred.
RealPage will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice. Additionally, RealPage processing of sensitive personal information is limited to activities necessary for the delivery and performance of RealPage Services on behalf of our Clients and end users.
For information about how your property manager uses and discloses your personal information, please contact your property manager and/or refer to its privacy policy.
VI.	Personal Information Rights and Choices – State Privacy Rights
Certain state jurisdictions provide their legal residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. Each right includes the ability to make a specific consumer request and corresponding obligation of the receiving party to (i) verify the identity of the requestor and (ii) respond in accordance with statutory guidelines. This section describes your rights and, along with
Section VII
below, explains how to exercise those rights if you are a resident of one of these states.
PLEASE NOTE: Under most circumstances, any request regarding your privacy rights should be submitted to the
property manager
that operates your apartment community or rental property.
As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider or data processor for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information when we act in that capacity. Our role as a service provider or data processor is to assist our Clients, upon their request, in responding to requests submitted to them by consumers.
However, for our direct-to-consumer and other products identified in
Section I
, you may submit privacy rights requests in accordance with their respective privacy policies.
Accessing and Updating/Correcting Personal Information
You have the right to confirm whether a data controller is processing your personal data and, if so, to access such personal data. You may access and update or correct your information (as needed) by logging into your RealPage Services account or contacting your property manager. If you require verification that your requested changes have been completed, and such verification is not readily displayed in your RealPage Services account, you may request confirmation at the email address listed below (See
Section XVII
“Contact Us”).
Data Portability and Access to Specific Information Regarding Personal Information Collection, Use & Disclosure
You have the right to request a copy of the personal information collected about you in a readily useable format that is transferable to other entities, to the extent technically feasible (frequently known as “data portability”).  If you are a California resident, you also have the right to request a disclosure summarizing the collection, use, sale, sharing and disclosure to third parties of your personal information over the past 12 months. You can request a data copy or disclosure by contacting your property manager. If your request is verified and granted by your property manager, the personal information subject to the request will be produced in a portable format from our systems and transmitted to you by your property manager.
Deletion of Personal Information
You have the right to request the deletion of any of your personal information that was collected and retained in connection with RealPage Services, subject to certain exceptions. You can request data deletion by contacting your property manager. If your request is verified and granted by your property manager, the personal information subject to the request will be deleted or permanently de-identified in our systems. RealPage will not attempt to re-identify any personal information de-identified through this process or any other de-identified information in our possession
A verified deletion request may be denied if retaining the information is permitted under the applicable law and is reasonably necessary for your property manager, RealPage, or our service providers or contractors to
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide the RealPage Services requested or reasonably anticipated by you within the context of our or your ongoing business relationship with your property manager, or otherwise perform our contract with your property manager.
Help to ensure security and integrity to the extent the use of your personal information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for those purposes.
Debug RealPage Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise that consumer’s free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research that conforms or adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion  is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the ability to complete such research, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are: (i) reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with our Clients; and (ii) compatible with the context in which you provided the information.
Comply with laws, regulations, statutes, codes, ordinances, or other legal obligations.
VII.	How to Submit a Consumer Privacy Request
Under most circumstances, any request regarding your privacy rights should be submitted to the
property manager
that operates your apartment community or rental property.
As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider or data processor for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information when we act in that capacity. Our role as a service provider or data processor is to assist our Clients, upon their request, in responding to requests submitted to them by consumers.
However, for our direct-to-consumer products and the four other RealPage Services with separate privacy policies identified in
Section I
, you may submit privacy rights requests in accordance with their respective privacy policies.
Only you (or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf) may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
Certain state privacy laws may limit the number of requests for access and/or portability that you can make in a 12-month period (e.g., two under California law). Other states may require one free response per consumer in a 12-month period but allow the data controller to either decline to act on a request or charge a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of responding to requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows confirmation of your identity as the person whose personal information was collected (and, if applicable, the authority and identity of an authorized representative).
Describe your request with sufficient detail to allow the data controller to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
VIII. Consumer Request Responses and Timelines
If your property manager notifies RealPage of a verified and granted consumer request, we will endeavor to respond to the request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require additional time beyond the 45 days, we are entitled to an extension up to an additional 45 days (for a total response timeline capped at 90 days). In the event that an extension is necessary, we will inform your property manager of the reason and extension period in writing.
RealPage does not charge fees to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will notify your property manager why we made that decision and provide them with a cost estimate before completing your request.
If we are unable to assist the Client in the fulfillment of a verifiable consumer request, we will provide your property manager with an explanation of the reason(s) for our inability to do so. If the applicable state law affords you the right to appeal a denial, you may appeal the decision in accordance with the process established by your property manager.
IX. Personal Information Sales, Sharing, Targeted Advertising and Profiling – Opt Out Rights
RealPage does
not
sell personal information collected through RealPage Services or use such information for targeted advertising or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning consumers and no such activity has occurred in the prior 12 months.  Subject to the statements in the last paragraph of this section, RealPage does
not
share personal information collected through the RealPage Services for cross-contextual behavioral advertising and no such activity has occurred in the prior 12 months.
If RealPage changes its practices and engages in the sale or sharing of personal information or in targeted advertising or profiling as regulated by law, we will provide advance notification to impacted individuals and offer the ability to opt in/opt out in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
XI. Other California Privacy Rights
California Employees, Applicants & Independent Contractors
– The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”) also prohibits businesses from retaliating against an employee, applicant for employment, or independent contractor for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
The State of California also grants California residents privacy rights via laws unaffiliated with the CCPA. Those rights include the following:
California's "Shine the Light" law (California Civil Code §1798.83)
permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@realpage.com.
California’s Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA – California Civil Code §§ 1786.10 -1786.40)
requires certain privacy disclosures related to investigative consumer reporting agencies’ operations, including the following:
Personal Information Disclosure: United States or Overseas
Personal information collected in connection with the provision of consumer reports and investigative consumer reports through our Resident Screening products (LeasingDesk and On-Site) is securely stored on servers located within the United States. This information may be made available to employees of RealPage or its affiliated companies who are located outside of the United States or its territories, solely for the purpose of performing their job duties and in accordance with applicable laws.
