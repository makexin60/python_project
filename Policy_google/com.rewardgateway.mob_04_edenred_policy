Reward Gateway (UK) Ltd (
"we"
,
"us"
or
"our"
) is committed
to protecting and respecting your privacy.
This Privacy Notice ("Notice") sets out the basis on which any
personal data we collect from you or from third parties, including
Redux (the
"administrator"
) who we have entered into
a Licence Agreement with, about you on this website (the "programme",
"Redux"
) will be processed by us.
We will be the Data Controller of your personal data which you
provide to us or which is collected by us via Redux.
This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and
use personal information about you and that we are required to
notify you of the information contained in this Privacy
Notice (
"Statement"
). It is important that you read this
Statement so that you are aware of how and why we are using
your personal information and how we will treat it.
We have appointed a Data Protection Team, who can be contacted
using the details at the end of this Notice should you have
any questions, complaints or feedback about your privacy.
The Type of Information We Collect From you and How We Use It
We will collect various types of personal information from you when you
use Redux, depending on the services which you use. Further
details of how we use your personal data are set out below.
In this section, we have indicated with asterisks whether we need to
process your personal data:
* to enter into and/or to perform our contract with you to provide
the services via Redux;
** to pursue legitimate interests of our own or of third parties,
provided that your interests and fundamental rights do not override
those interests;
*** to enable us to comply with our legal obligations; and/or
**** with your consent.
Before you register
Before you register on Redux, to allow us to carry out our
eligibility checks* we will ask the administrator to provide two pieces
of unique information about you (such as your postcode, start date
or date of birth).
The administrator has provided us with your information for an account to be created.
The administrator will sometimes also provide the information necessary
to allow us to conduct National Minimum Wage and Basic Earnings
assessments automatically on their behalf when we are required to do
so***/** (see When you enter into a salary deduction agreement with
the administrator section below for more details).
When you register
In addition to the personal data provided to us by the administrator,
when you register on Redux we will also collect and store
personal information about you, such as your name, company identifier,
email address, password, postcode, a contact telephone number, gender and
date of birth. At the administrator’s choice, we may also collect
additional information about you such as your office location.
You will also need to provide the information necessary to allow us to
carry out our eligibility check (which will vary dependent on the
information provided by the administrator, see above).
This information will be used in order to complete your registration and
to allow you to use Redux*. You will not be able to register
without at least providing your name, email address and password, as these are used to secure your account and
to allow us to confirm your identity if you contact the support team.
When you login
Each time you log in to Redux, we automatically conduct checks
against your Internet Protocol (IP) address to ensure your security.
This includes looking up your IP address against a “proxy denylist” to
check that someone is not using your credentials and trying to hide
their location**. This proxy denylist is operated by MaxMind, Inc. If
your IP address appears on it, we will not allow you to login.
We also look up the IP address in a static database we download from
MaxMind Inc. to check which country the IP is affiliated with. This
helps us to further protect your account against people who may have
access to your credentials**. If we do spot a change, we will alert you
that a login has occured from a new device or location.
This information along with time and event data (such as successful or
failed logins) are also recorded in our database for audit purposes**.
Depending on the services you use on Redux, we may collect and
process additional personal data about you, as set out below.
When you use Cashback
If you visit a Cashback retailer on Redux, we will record that
you clicked and visited their website for the purpose of tracking the
Cashback earned*. We will provide the retailer with a pseudo-anonymous
‘click reference’ to allow us to attribute the purchase and Cashback to you.
Each of these retailers are independent on
Redux so you should check their privacy terms to make sure you
are happy with them before providing any other details to them.
If you have a problem with the retailer and your Cashback, we may need
to provide them with additional information about your order to
help**. We will ask you for the minimum information we need to do
this, but you will be responsible for the accuracy and level of detail
it contains.
When you withdraw your Cashback
If you make a request for a Cashback withdrawals to your bank account,
you will need to provide your bank details for us to process the
withdrawal but we will only store your bank details until the withdrawal
is processed*. They will be shared with our bank, HSBC, to process your
request after which all the details will be destroyed.
Alternatively you will be able to withdraw your Cashback as part or full
payment for goods on Redux or ask us to donate it to the
nominated charity on Redux*.
When you make a debit or credit card purchase
If you choose to purchase goods using a credit or debit card through
Redux, we will collect your payment details from you and pass
them to Checkout.com, our secure payment processors,
who will use them to process the payment*. We do not store or process
your credit or debit details on our servers.
We will also collect your delivery address from you, and use the contact
details previously provided, to allow us to process the order*.
If you opt-in to saving your credit or debit details for future use on
Redux, your information will be stored securely by our payment
processor. You can update or remove these at any time.
Where goods are dispatched by a third-party supplier, we may need to
share your information with them to fulfil your order, such as your
contact details and delivery address*. This will be clearly indicated
to you at the point of purchase. You will be able to review these
suppliers’ privacy terms before any information is shared with them.
We will also carry out a fraud check during the order process. This
check is carried out by our third party provider, Sift Science (“Sift
Science”)**. Sift Science will only act in accordance with our
instructions and how they will process your personal data is set out
below.
Sift Science will collect information about your behaviour on the
portal (such as the length of time between logging in and reaching
checkout), technical information about the device used (such as your
browser version and IP address) and the details you enter at checkout
(such as your contact details and delivery and billing address).
After you have placed your order and before goods are dispatched, Sift
Science will use this information to provide us with a score based on
the likelihood of fraud. The score provided determines whether your
order is automatically accepted by us or queued for our human review. If
it is queued for human review, we will carry out a manual fraud check to
decide whether to accept or refuse your order or, in some circumstances,
require payment to be made by an alternative, more secure mechanism such
as a bank transfer. For more information about this processing activity,
please contact us using the details provided at the end of this Notice
in the “Contacting Us” section.
After too many failed orders
If too many failed orders originate from your account, we will
automatically restrict access to your account. Before allowing you to
access your account again, we will notify you and ask you
for further supporting documents such as your driving licence, council
tax bill or statement, bank or credit card statement, utility bill or
payslip, as evidence that it is you attempting these orders**. If
these documents are not to our satisfaction, we may contact the
administrator with the intention of verifying that it is you using your
account in this way**.
These supporting documents will only be used for the purpose of
verifying your identity, will not be shared with any third parties and
will only be retained by us until we have reviewed them, even if we are
not satisfied with their legitimacy or authenticity.
You do not need to provide these supporting documents to us but, if you
choose not to, then we will not be able to provide you with access to
your account.
When you enter into a salary deduction agreement with the administrator
If you choose to purchase goods through Redux and enter into a
salary deduction agreement with the administrator, such as Childcare
Vouchers, Cycle to Work, Smart Tech or Holiday Trading, we will collect
your name, address, IP address, browser details, payroll information,
and deduction amount. This information will be provided to the
administrator as proof of your electronic signature of the salary
deduction agreement and to enable them to administer the deduction and
pay us for the goods on your behalf*.
Additionally, if the administrator has provided us with the information
necessary such as your payroll and salary information (see
National
minimum wage and national living
wage
for more details), we will use this information to conduct the National
Minimum Wage check on their behalf in line with the parameters they have
provided***. The employer is legally obliged to conduct such as
check.
If they have not provided us with this information, we will ask you to
provide it instead.
If the administrator provided us with the information necessary to
conduct the National Minimum Wage check, we will conduct the check and
automatically approve or forward your application for salary sacrifice
benefits to them for review. For more information about this processing
activity, please contact us using the details provided at the end of
this Notice in the “Contacting Us” section.
If you provide us with the information necessary to conduct the National
Minimum Wage check, then we will conduct the check but the results of
all checks will be forwarded for review by the administrator before your
application is approved or rejected. If you are not eligible, you can
contest the assessment with the administrator.
You will not be able to purchase goods through Redux via a
salary deduction agreement unless you or the administrator provide this
information to us.
We will also provide the information necessary to the relevant third
party benefit provider (see the Disclosures of your Information section)
to allow them to provide the benefit to you. This information will vary
by benefit provider but will usually contain at least your name and
application amount.
Special Information for Smart Tech
When you use SmartTech to purchase technology, your personal information
is not shared with a third-party supplier. We obtain vouchers direct
from our supplier and issue them to you when you choose to participate
in SmartTech.
When you take out a Healthcare Cashplan
If you decide to purchase a Healthcare Cashplan through Redux,
we will ask for your bank account details. These are used to allow our
Healthcare Cashplan provider to set up a Direct Debit for all future
payments*. We will pass your bank details directly to the provider to
allow them to set up the Direct Debit. We will also provide the
Healthcare Cashplan provider with your name, telephone number, date of
birth, gender, details of any existing medical conditions and selected
plan (and your partner’s if you choose this option) to allow them to
provide the benefit to you.
When you send an eCard or when you make a nomination
If you ask us to send an eCard, you will need to provide us with the
name of the person you are sending the eCard to (“the recipient”). If
the recipient has already registered on Redux, we will send the
eCard on your behalf to their registered email address****.
If they have not already registered, you will also need to provide an
email address which we will send the eCard on your behalf to****.
The recipient will be asked to confirm that they have read and
understood this notice and agree to our Terms & Conditions
before being able to view your message.
You must have the consent of the recipient to give us their name and, if
applicable, email address and also any personal information you disclose
in your message to them. This information will also be disclosed to the
administrator for the purposes of performance management.
When you write a blog or comment / react to content
When you write a blog or comment / react to content on the site, we will
display your name and any other personal information you choose to share
via your blog or comment**.
When you complete a survey
From time to time you may be invited to participate in a survey run by the administrator.
If you complete a survey, all of the information that you provide in connection with that survey
will be provided to the administrator. Please be aware that the administrator controls the survey
and what happens to the survey data, which may include using that data for research purposes
or making the survey responses public****.
We recommend that you contact the administrator to understand how they
will use your survey responses. In some cases, the administrator may decide to provide
you with their own separate privacy notice governing the use of your
survey data in which case the information you submit in connection with such surveys will
be governed by that privacy notice.
When you contact us
If you contact us for support purposes, we will require some information
to handle your query. The following data are saved in Zendesk to enable
processing: your name, email address, telephone number any other personal
information you provide to us for the purpose of dealing with your query.

When you visit Redux we will automatically collect
information about your visit such as the pages you viewed, services you viewed or searched for, length of visits to certain pages,
the times and dates of these actions, details of page response times and
any download errors that occurred.
We will also collect data from the device and application that you use
to access our services, including your IP address (from which we may
infer your geographic location), login information and browser type.

another website or in an email) we record information about that source.
We will use the above information in order to:

information and the combined information for the purposes set out in

The Administrator
Because the administrator pays us to operate  for you,
they’ll want to know how the website is performing. Except as set out
elsewhere in this Statement, we will only share information with the
administrator on an aggregated and anonymous basis about how often
you’ve used the website and what services you used. If you use our SmartSpending discounts product, we will not share
information with the administrator about how much you’ve spent, where
you shop, and how much you’ve saved as an individual, as we treat this
as confidential.
Our Internal Teams and Prospective Retailers
We also use information about you on an aggregated and anonymised basis
for internal management purposes, to, share it with current or
prospective retailers and to use it to target offers that are made to
users of Redux. This type of information includes, for example,
the types of product that you purchase and the value of those purchases.
However, you can’t be identified from this information.
Members of our Group
We share personal information with members of our group for the purposes
of providing the benefits to you and managing our business: RG Engagement
Group Ltd, Reward Gateway Pty Ltd, Reward Gateway (UK) Ltd Branch, Reward Gateway (USA) Inc,
International Benefits Holdings Ltd, Asperity Employee Benefits Group Ltd
Other Parties
We will also disclose your personal information to third parties:
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which
case we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller
or buyer of such business or assets;
if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third
party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers
will be one of the transferred assets; and/or
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in
order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or
apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect
the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, customers and
providers. This will include sharing your information as part of a
legal or official investigation if we have evidence or reason to
suspect that transactions on your account could be fraudulent.
International Transfers of your Personal Data
A number of the service providers listed above are based outside the UK and European Economic Area and your personal information may therefore be transferred to or accessed from outside of the UK and European Economic Area.
We have either signed UK and EU Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses with these providers or we have confirmed that they have Binding Corporate Rules in place. This ensures that your personal data is treated by those providers in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU and UK laws on data protection. We also ensure there are adequate supplementary measures in place, such as encryption at rest and in transit.
Other entities in our group, Reward Gateway (USA) Inc and Reward Gateway (Australia) Pty Ltd, are also located outside the EEA in countries that are not considered to provide an adequate level of data protection. We have put in place appropriate intra-group agreements using the EU Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect personal data when it is transferred to those entities.
We can supply a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to you on request.
Your Rights
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights to:
request access to your personal information (commonly known as a
“data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy
of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we
are lawfully processing it;
request correction of the personal information that we hold about
you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
information we hold about you corrected;
request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to
ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no
good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right
to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you
have exercised your right to object to processing (see below);
request the restriction of processing of your personal information,
for example if you want to establish its accuracy or the reason for
processing it; and
request the transfer of your personal information to another party.
You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
third party) and there is something about your particular situation
which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal
information for direct marketing purposes.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or
to exercise any of the other rights above). However, we may charge a
reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or
excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in
such circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from
you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person
who has no right to receive it.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the
right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time.
To withdraw your consent, please contact us using any of the details set out below in the “Contacting Us” section
or change your preferences in the "Communication Preferences" section, under “My Account” within Redux. If we email you under the basis of Consent, there will always be a an easy way to opt out in the footer of the email.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information
Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data
protection issues.

your request within 5 working days.
Storage of your information
Unless we need to keep your data for legal purposes, we will only retain
your personal information for 60 days after the administrator lets us
know you no longer work for them or they decide to use a different
service.
The legal purposes for which we may need to retain your data for
include:
retaining payment records for one year to comply with PCI DSS
regulations;
retaining backups for up-to 180 days after deprovisioning; and
retaining your order history for two years from the date of your
order in case of a dispute.
We may also retain anonymised data about you for longer periods for
integrity and financial reporting purposes.
Recordings of calls are retained for 40 days and chat transcripts are
retained for 90 days.
We take the security and confidentiality of your personal information
very seriously. We will use strict procedures and security features to
aim at preventing unauthorised access, such as secure software design, being ISO 27001 certified, strict access controls, penetration testing, the use of encryption and hashing and robust physical security controls.
