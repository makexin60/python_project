Moon Phase Calendar
Moon Phase Calendar
This application is not only an advanced lunar calendar with notifications, but also a valuable source of information on the Moon in chosen location. In the application it is possible to check e.g. current phase of the Moon, the illumination and the dates of subsequent phases. The application shows also useful information about the Sun, dawn, twilight and important phenomena of light.
Moon Phase Calendar is dedicated for:
people who feel the influence of the Moon on their body
- the calendar of the Moon phases allows to carefully plan important events so that the Moon favors its  implementation. This application will notify up to 3 days in advance about Full Moon or New Moon. In addition, it is possible to observe phenomena such as perigee (the Moon closest to the Earth) or apogee (the Moon farthest to the Earth) - thanks to this it is known when the influence of the Moon is strongest or the weakest.
astronomy amateurs
- view of the compass with the visualization of the azimuths of the Moon and the Sun will allow a better understanding of the phenomena associated with them (at school, university or during independent observation). The compass shows through colored arches the visibility of the Sun or the Moon in the sky on a given day in the selected location.
photographers
- the view of the Sun allows to check when there is a "golden hour" and "blue hour", so it is possible to take beautiful and professional photos outdoors.
