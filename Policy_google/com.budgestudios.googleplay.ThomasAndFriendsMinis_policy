At Budge Studios, we use the power of technology to thrill, educate, and entertain children around the world through creative and innovative apps. We know you care about your personal information and, if you are a parent or guardian, the privacy and security of your children’s personal information.  We designed this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use, process, and disclose your personal information and exercise your privacy rights.

The Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect from you directly, such as your contact information, and indirectly, such as information about your game play usage, and State or Province level location data. It also explains the type of information we obtain through cookies and other tracking technologies as well as other sources such as social networks. This Privacy Policy also explains how we use the information we’ve collected, including to provide you with the apps and optimize our products.  It also contains information about the service providers with whom we share information for purposes such as completing purchases, data analytics, marketing and advertising, website hosting, and technical support.
We’ve also included detailed information on how we protect your children’s personal information.  We adhere to special protections for children’s data such as those established by Quebec Law 25 (the Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information), the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and similar provisions in U.S. state laws, as well as other applicable foreign laws governing children’s data. We do not use children’s information for behavioral advertising.  In summary, we take many precautions designed to protect the online privacy of children, and we encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their children's privacy by discussing this Privacy Policy with them.

It applies to your use of the Budgestudios.com and Budgestudios.ca websites (the Sites) and the mobile apps published by Budge Studios (the Apps) (in this Privacy Policy, the Sites, and Apps are referred to collectively as the Platforms).
By using the Platforms you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy and understand our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities described therein.  In case of discrepancies between the English version and any other versions of this Privacy Policy, the English version shall prevail.

section below.
2. ESRB PRIVACY CERTIFIED
The ESRB certification seal shown on our Platforms confirms that Budge Studios is a valid licensee, and participating member, of the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Certified Program (
ESRB Privacy Certified
). To help protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and have had all areas of our Platforms where this Privacy Policy is posted reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use, and disclosure practices. As a licensee of this program, we are subject to audits of our Platforms and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB.
3. WHAT INFORMATION DOES BUDGE STUDIOS COLLECT?
A.
Information You Provide
Our Sites are general audience and intended for parents and users over the age of digital consent. When you use our Sites, Budge Studios collects information that you provide, such as when you apply for a job or contact customer support. The categories of information we collect include the following:
• Contact identifiers
- including your first and last name, and email address.
• Content
- including content within any messages you send to us (such as questions to customer support).
Our Apps are designed to inspire kids’ imaginations and are primarily intended for children. Budge Studios focuses on data minimization, especially with respect to children. We do not affirmatively request information through our Apps, unless otherwise specified herein.
Please do not provide any information that we do not request.
B.
Information Collected Automatically
For both our Sites and Apps, Budge Studios automatically collects information when you use the Platforms. We automatically collect the following categories of information:
• Device Identifiers

This information is automatically collected through cookies and other tracking technologies incorporated into our Platforms, as described below:
• Cookies
- which are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving language preferences and maintaining your sessions while you are on our Sites. The cookies used on our Sites also contain information used for site navigation and analytics.
• App Technologies
- which are technologies included in our Apps that may collect information from your device. For example, our Apps include software development kids (SDKs), which are tools that provide certain functionality, such as allowing us to analyze the performance of our Apps or bring you advertising in our Apps.
The information we collect through tracking technologies within our Platforms is used for a variety of purposes, as further specified in this Privacy Policy. Also, many of the tracking technologies we use are provided by service providers working on our behalf. For example, we use analytics providers, such as Google Analytics and Amplitude to help us analyze your use of the Sites and Apps, compile statistical reports on the Site's and Apps' activity, and provide us with other services relating to Site and App activity and internet usage. We also work with third-party ad serving services, advertisers, and other technology services to serve advertisements in some of our Apps.
However, we do not collect or use information for behavioral advertising to children. For details on how we handle children’s information, see the
How Does Budge Studios Handle Children's Information?

The categories of sources from which we collect information include:
• Vendors
– which are companies we work with for the purposes of security and fraud prevention.

• Business Transactions
- We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets or rights relating thereto.
• Legal Rights and Obligations
- We may use and/or disclose your information to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage.

6. HOW DOES BUDGE STUDIOS HANDLE CHILDREN'S INFORMATION?
Budge Studios has developed its Platforms to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages. Some parts of the Platforms are primarily intended for children, such as our Apps, while others are intended for parents, such as our Sites. Whenever we refer to children in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under the age of 13 (or, if outside the U.S., under the age of digital majority).
Budge Studios complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children. If you are a data subject in Europe or a California resident and have a child under the age of 16, please see the
What Should I Know as a Data Subject in Europe?
and
What Should I Know as a California Resident?
sections.
If you have any questions or comments about how we treat children's information or our compliance with COPPA, please contact us as set out in the
How Do I Contact Budge Studios?
section. If you would like to learn more about COPPA and ESRB Privacy Certified’s Kids Privacy Seal, which signals our compliance with COPPA, you can refer to the
Children's Privacy
section of the Federal Trade Commission's website.
A. Websites
Budge Studios does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by COPPA from children through its Sites. If we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal information from a child in violation of COPPA, we will promptly delete it. Parents should note that if they provide information about their child, COPPA will not apply to that information.
B. Collection, Use, and Sharing of Information from Children.
•
Photos, Videos, and Audio
- Our Apps may request access to the device's camera, photo album, or microphone to provide in-game functionality. For example, a child may blow into the microphone in order to blow out cartoon candles or take a photo of their arm with a cartoon bracelet and save that image to their local device. Budge Studios does not store or share any photos, videos, or audio files that contain children's images or voices through our Apps. All photos, videos, and audio files are stored locally on the device only and we do not encourage or enable children to make such information publicly available online.  We do not request, prompt, or encourage children to submit personal information online.
• Persistent Identifiers
- Budge Studios collects, uses and shares persistent identifiers (digital labels specific to a user’s device) through our Apps solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Apps or as otherwise permitted by COPPA and other applicable data protection laws. This information may be collected by Budge Studios or another entity providing a service to Budge Studios.
• In-App Advertising
- Some of our Apps incorporate advertising serving technology offered by our service providers (through SDKs), which enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game and displayed while the user plays. The data collected for this purpose, often through “persistent identifiers” may be used for ad attribution and related internal operations purposes such as allowing our service providers to calculate the number of user views, cap the frequency of ads, and serve ads in a format that fits the device. While our Apps may contain contextual advertisements about Budge Studios or products and services of another entity, we prohibit behavioral advertising to children in our Apps or through data collected from our Apps.
We do not collect more personal information from children than is reasonably necessary to use our Apps.
• Security
– We take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information collected through our Apps as explained in Section 9, below. This includes taking reasonable steps to release such information only to entities capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security. We retain children's personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.
• Parental Choices and Controls
- If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we have collected your child's personal information in violation of COPPA, please contact us as set out in the
How Do I Contact Budge Studios?
Section, and we will remove such information to the extent required by COPPA.
7. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT THIRD PARTIES?
If you click on a link to a website, platform, or service not controlled by us, including on an advertisement or an ad provider link, you will leave the Budge Studios Platform you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Also, if you visit our brand page on a social media platform, you will also be interacting with that platform. These other entities may use tracking technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these other entities from whom you request services. If you visit a website, platform, or service that is linked to on a Budge Studios Platform, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any information on that site.
8. WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AND CHOICES?
A. Reviewing, Correcting and Deleting Your Information.
If you wish to request access to certain information you have voluntarily submitted to Budge Studios or request that such information be corrected or deleted, or if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the information practices of Budge Studios, please contact Budge Studios as set out in the
How Do I Contact Budge Studios?
section. Your right to access, correct, or delete your information is subject to applicable legal restrictions. We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. Please note that we will retain and use information about you as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
If you believe we have collected and stored any personal information from children under 13 or the age of digital consent in other jurisdictions, parents or legal guardians can request access to review such information, have it deleted, or stop our further collection or use of such information. To make any of these requests (when applicable), please contact us as set out in the
How Do I Contact Budge Studios?
section below.
B. Tracking Technology Choices.
• Cookies
- Most browsers accept cookies by default. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, some areas of our Sites may not function properly.
• Do Not Track
- Users can set privacy preferences through the Do Not Track (“DNT”) mechanism in certain web browsers. In addition, some browsers or plug-ins use a “Global Privacy Control” (“GPC”), which allows you to opt out of certain data processing. (You can learn more about the GPC at https://globalprivacycontrol.org/.) Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. If our site detects a GPC signal from your device, however, we will interpret it as either a Do Not Sell request or a request to limit the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising depending on the law applicable to your jurisdiction. Note that we do not engage in any behavioral advertising to children.
• App Technologies
- You can stop all collection of information via an App by uninstalling the App.
C. Analytics.
Some service providers we work with offer their own opt-out tools for tracking technologies.
For Google Analytics, you can find their opt-out by visiting:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB
and downloading the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, or visiting Google Analytics for Display Advertising of the Google Display Network at
https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/
.
Please note that any opt-outs only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any entity's opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their practices or programs.
9. HOW DOES BUDGE STUDIOS PROTECT THE SECURITY OF MY INFORMATION?
Budge Studios is committed to informing, raising awareness and training its employees yearly on best practices for protecting personal information. We implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards designed to help protect the security, integrity, accuracy and privacy of the information you have provided from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.
10. FOR HOW LONG DOES BUDGE STUDIOS STORE MY INFORMATION?
We do not retain personal information longer than is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.
For users of the Barbie Dream House app, data about the customizations that the user has made to the dreamhouse are stored in the cloud for the friend sharing feature.  This data is deleted from our servers if it has not been updated for more than 11 months.
If you have submitted a resume to us while applying to work for Budge Studios we will destroy these materials if you are not selected for a position unless you have otherwise given us permission to keep your resume for a future job opening.
11. DOES BUDGE STUDIOS TRANSFER INFORMATION INTERNATIONALLY?
Our Platforms are operated in Canada, and the information we collect is governed by Canadian law. If you are accessing the Platforms from outside of Canada, please be aware that information collected through the Platforms will be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions. Data protection laws in Canada may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Platforms or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of information about you in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions as set out in this Privacy Policy. If your data is collected in Europe, we will transfer your personal data subject to appropriate safeguards, including standard contractual clauses.

Data Subjects Located in the EU:
For European specific requests, you can use any of the methods above or as further specified in the
What Should I Know as a Data Subject in Europe?
section below.
13. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A DATA SUBJECT IN EUROPE?
A. Budge Studios is a Data Controller.
Data protection laws in Europe make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as controllers) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as processors). Budge Studios acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our apps, websites, emails, and advertisements.
B. Budge Studios has a Lawful Basis for Processing.
Data protection laws in Europe require a lawful basis for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
C. Your European Privacy Rights.
If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
You may exercise your rights by submitting a written request to us at the address set out in the How Do I Contact Budge Studios? section above. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
D. Children in Europe.
Where the basis for our processing of personal data from children under 16 in Europe is consent, we will make appropriate efforts to verify that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over those children, and, if we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal data from those children without parental consent, we will promptly delete it. If you are a child under 16 in Europe, please speak with your parent or guardian about this Privacy Policy so you can better understand how we use your personal data.
E. Complaints
If you have a complaint about our use of your personal data or response to your requests regarding your personal data, you may submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us.
In addition to the contact information above, please contact our Data Protection Officer at
privacy@budgestudios.com
14. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT?
These additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA) provides additional rights, and requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise those rights.

section below.
F. Shine the Light.
California's Shine the Light law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties' and affiliates' own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.

At Budge Studios, we use the power of technology to thrill, educate, and entertain children around the world through creative and innovative apps. We know you care about your personal information and, if you are a parent or guardian, the privacy and security of your children’s personal information.  We designed this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use, process, and disclose your personal information and exercise your privacy rights.

The Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect from you directly, such as your contact information, and indirectly, such as information about your game play usage, and State or Province level location data. It also explains the type of information we obtain through cookies and other tracking technologies as well as other sources such as social networks. This Privacy Policy also explains how we use the information we’ve collected, including to provide you with the apps and optimize our products.  It also contains information about the service providers with whom we share information for purposes such as completing purchases, data analytics, marketing and advertising, website hosting, and technical support.
We’ve also included detailed information on how we protect your children’s personal information.  We adhere to special protections for children’s data such as those established by Quebec Law 25 (the Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information), the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and similar provisions in U.S. state laws, as well as other applicable foreign laws governing children’s data. We do not use children’s information for behavioral advertising.  In summary, we take many precautions designed to protect the online privacy of children, and we encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their children's privacy by discussing this Privacy Policy with them.

It applies to your use of the Budgestudios.com and Budgestudios.ca websites (the Sites) and the mobile apps published by Budge Studios (the Apps) (in this Privacy Policy, the Sites, and Apps are referred to collectively as the Platforms).
By using the Platforms you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy and understand our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities described therein.  In case of discrepancies between the English version and any other versions of this Privacy Policy, the English version shall prevail.

section below.
2. ESRB PRIVACY CERTIFIED
The ESRB certification seal shown on our Platforms confirms that Budge Studios is a valid licensee, and participating member, of the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Certified Program (
ESRB Privacy Certified
). To help protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and have had all areas of our Platforms where this Privacy Policy is posted reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use, and disclosure practices. As a licensee of this program, we are subject to audits of our Platforms and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB.
3. WHAT INFORMATION DOES BUDGE STUDIOS COLLECT?
A.

The categories of information we collect include the following:
• Contact identifiers
- including your first and last name, and email address.
• Content
- including content within any messages you send to us (such as questions to customer support).
Our Apps are designed to inspire kids’ imaginations and are primarily intended for children. Budge Studios focuses on data minimization, especially with respect to children. We do not affirmatively request information through our Apps, unless otherwise specified herein.
Please do not provide any information that we do not request.
B.
Information Collected Automatically
For both our Sites and Apps, Budge Studios automatically collects information when you use the Platforms. We automatically collect the following categories of information:

This information is automatically collected through cookies and other tracking technologies incorporated into our Platforms, as described below:
• Cookies
- which are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving language preferences and maintaining your sessions while you are on our Sites. The cookies used on our Sites also contain information used for site navigation and analytics.
• App Technologies
- which are technologies included in our Apps that may collect information from your device. For example, our Apps include software development kids (SDKs), which are tools that provide certain functionality, such as allowing us to analyze the performance of our Apps or bring you advertising in our Apps.
The information we collect through tracking technologies within our Platforms is used for a variety of purposes, as further specified in this Privacy Policy. Also, many of the tracking technologies we use are provided by service providers working on our behalf. For example, we use analytics providers, such as Google Analytics and Amplitude to help us analyze your use of the Sites and Apps, compile statistical reports on the Site's and Apps' activity, and provide us with other services relating to Site and App activity and internet usage. We also work with third-party ad serving services, advertisers, and other technology services to serve advertisements in some of our Apps.
However, we do not collect or use information for behavioral advertising to children. For details on how we handle children’s information, see the
How Does Budge Studios Handle Children's Information?

The categories of sources from which we collect information include:
• Vendors
– which are companies we work with for the purposes of security and fraud prevention.

• Business Transactions
- We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets or rights relating thereto.
• Legal Rights and Obligations
- We may use and/or disclose your information to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage.

6. HOW DOES BUDGE STUDIOS HANDLE CHILDREN'S INFORMATION?
Budge Studios has developed its Platforms to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages. Some parts of the Platforms are primarily intended for children, such as our Apps, while others are intended for parents, such as our Sites. Whenever we refer to children in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under the age of 13 (or, if outside the U.S., under the age of digital majority).
Budge Studios complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children. If you are a data subject in Europe or a California resident and have a child under the age of 16, please see the
What Should I Know as a Data Subject in Europe?
and
What Should I Know as a California Resident?
sections.
If you have any questions or comments about how we treat children's information or our compliance with COPPA, please contact us as set out in the
How Do I Contact Budge Studios?
section. If you would like to learn more about COPPA and ESRB Privacy Certified’s Kids Privacy Seal, which signals our compliance with COPPA, you can refer to the
Children's Privacy
section of the Federal Trade Commission's website.
A. Websites
Budge Studios does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by COPPA from children through its Sites. If we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal information from a child in violation of COPPA, we will promptly delete it. Parents should note that if they provide information about their child, COPPA will not apply to that information.
B. Collection, Use, and Sharing of Information from Children.
•
Photos, Videos, and Audio
- Our Apps may request access to the device's camera, photo album, or microphone to provide in-game functionality. For example, a child may blow into the microphone in order to blow out cartoon candles or take a photo of their arm with a cartoon bracelet and save that image to their local device. Budge Studios does not store or share any photos, videos, or audio files that contain children's images or voices through our Apps. All photos, videos, and audio files are stored locally on the device only and we do not encourage or enable children to make such information publicly available online.  We do not request, prompt, or encourage children to submit personal information online.
• Persistent Identifiers
- Budge Studios collects, uses and shares persistent identifiers (digital labels specific to a user’s device) through our Apps solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Apps or as otherwise permitted by COPPA and other applicable data protection laws. This information may be collected by Budge Studios or another entity providing a service to Budge Studios.
• In-App Advertising
- Some of our Apps incorporate advertising serving technology offered by our service providers (through SDKs), which enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game and displayed while the user plays. The data collected for this purpose, often through “persistent identifiers” may be used for ad attribution and related internal operations purposes such as allowing our service providers to calculate the number of user views, cap the frequency of ads, and serve ads in a format that fits the device. While our Apps may contain contextual advertisements about Budge Studios or products and services of another entity, we prohibit behavioral advertising to children in our Apps or through data collected from our Apps.
We do not collect more personal information from children than is reasonably necessary to use our Apps.
• Security
– We take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information collected through our Apps as explained in Section 9, below. This includes taking reasonable steps to release such information only to entities capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security. We retain children's personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.
• Parental Choices and Controls
- If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we have collected your child's personal information in violation of COPPA, please contact us as set out in the
How Do I Contact Budge Studios?
Section, and we will remove such information to the extent required by COPPA.
7. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT THIRD PARTIES?
If you click on a link to a website, platform, or service not controlled by us, including on an advertisement or an ad provider link, you will leave the Budge Studios Platform you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Also, if you visit our brand page on a social media platform, you will also be interacting with that platform. These other entities may use tracking technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these other entities from whom you request services. If you visit a website, platform, or service that is linked to on a Budge Studios Platform, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any information on that site.
8. WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AND CHOICES?
A. Reviewing, Correcting and Deleting Your Information.
If you wish to request access to certain information you have voluntarily submitted to Budge Studios or request that such information be corrected or deleted, or if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the information practices of Budge Studios, please contact Budge Studios as set out in the
How Do I Contact Budge Studios?
section. Your right to access, correct, or delete your information is subject to applicable legal restrictions. We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. Please note that we will retain and use information about you as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
If you believe we have collected and stored any personal information from children under 13 or the age of digital consent in other jurisdictions, parents or legal guardians can request access to review such information, have it deleted, or stop our further collection or use of such information. To make any of these requests (when applicable), please contact us as set out in the
How Do I Contact Budge Studios?
section below.
B. Tracking Technology Choices.
• Cookies
- Most browsers accept cookies by default. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, some areas of our Sites may not function properly.
• Do Not Track
- Users can set privacy preferences through the Do Not Track (“DNT”) mechanism in certain web browsers. In addition, some browsers or plug-ins use a “Global Privacy Control” (“GPC”), which allows you to opt out of certain data processing. (You can learn more about the GPC at https://globalprivacycontrol.org/.) Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. If our site detects a GPC signal from your device, however, we will interpret it as either a Do Not Sell request or a request to limit the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising depending on the law applicable to your jurisdiction. Note that we do not engage in any behavioral advertising to children.
• App Technologies
- You can stop all collection of information via an App by uninstalling the App.
C. Analytics.
Some service providers we work with offer their own opt-out tools for tracking technologies.
For Google Analytics, you can find their opt-out by visiting:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB
and downloading the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, or visiting Google Analytics for Display Advertising of the Google Display Network at
https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/
.
Please note that any opt-outs only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any entity's opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their practices or programs.
9. HOW DOES BUDGE STUDIOS PROTECT THE SECURITY OF MY INFORMATION?
Budge Studios is committed to informing, raising awareness and training its employees yearly on best practices for protecting personal information. We implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards designed to help protect the security, integrity, accuracy and privacy of the information you have provided from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.
10. FOR HOW LONG DOES BUDGE STUDIOS STORE MY INFORMATION?
We do not retain personal information longer than is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.
For users of the Barbie Dream House app, data about the customizations that the user has made to the dreamhouse are stored in the cloud for the friend sharing feature.  This data is deleted from our servers if it has not been updated for more than 11 months.
If you have submitted a resume to us while applying to work for Budge Studios we will destroy these materials if you are not selected for a position unless you have otherwise given us permission to keep your resume for a future job opening.
11. DOES BUDGE STUDIOS TRANSFER INFORMATION INTERNATIONALLY?
Our Platforms are operated in Canada, and the information we collect is governed by Canadian law. If you are accessing the Platforms from outside of Canada, please be aware that information collected through the Platforms will be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions. Data protection laws in Canada may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Platforms or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of information about you in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions as set out in this Privacy Policy. If your data is collected in Europe, we will transfer your personal data subject to appropriate safeguards, including standard contractual clauses.

Data Subjects Located in the EU:
For European specific requests, you can use any of the methods above or as further specified in the
What Should I Know as a Data Subject in Europe?
section below.
13. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A DATA SUBJECT IN EUROPE?
A. Budge Studios is a Data Controller.
Data protection laws in Europe make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as controllers) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as processors). Budge Studios acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our apps, websites, emails, and advertisements.
B. Budge Studios has a Lawful Basis for Processing.
Data protection laws in Europe require a lawful basis for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
C. Your European Privacy Rights.
If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
You may exercise your rights by submitting a written request to us at the address set out in the How Do I Contact Budge Studios? section above. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
D. Children in Europe.
Where the basis for our processing of personal data from children under 16 in Europe is consent, we will make appropriate efforts to verify that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over those children, and, if we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal data from those children without parental consent, we will promptly delete it. If you are a child under 16 in Europe, please speak with your parent or guardian about this Privacy Policy so you can better understand how we use your personal data.
E. Complaints
If you have a complaint about our use of your personal data or response to your requests regarding your personal data, you may submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us.
In addition to the contact information above, please contact our Data Protection Officer at
privacy@budgestudios.com
14. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT?
These additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA) provides additional rights, and requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise those rights.

section below.
F. Shine the Light.
California's Shine the Light law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties' and affiliates' own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.

ESRB Privacy
Certified
A full-service, annual membership privacy consulting and seal program for websites, mobile apps, and internet-connected products.
Click To Learn More
The Privacy Certified Seal demonstrates members’ voluntary compliance with our rigorous program requirements.
For online services directed to children, the Privacy Certified Kids Seal demonstrates members’ compliance with our FTC-approved COPPA Safe Harbor program.
Program Services
Members of the ESRB Privacy Certified program proudly display our seals to demonstrate their compliance with online and mobile privacy protection laws.
COPPA Safe Harbor
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has approved the Privacy Certified program as a Safe Harbor under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which helps shield our members from potential sanctions and fines.
GDPR & Global Guidance
We provide guidance to our members on privacy laws and regulations outside the U.S., including but not limited to, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) as well as the EU and UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Children’s Code (aka the Age Appropriate Design Code or AADC). We also help our program members seek certification under the ICO-approved
Age Check Certification Scheme.
Individualized Consulting
We work hand-in-hand with our members to create a privacy-by-design approach that meets their individual and unique business needs.
Monitoring and Reporting
We conduct regular reviews and random spot checks of member websites and apps, enabling us to identify potential privacy issues on an ongoing basis and to work with members to address them quickly and effectively.
Identity Verification Services
In exclusive partnership with Veratad Technologies, our members can access identity and age verification authentication solutions at special discounted rates. Such services can be used when obtaining parental consent under COPPA and to reduce the risk of fraud or theft of service.
