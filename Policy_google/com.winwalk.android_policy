PRIVACY POLICY
Last update: February 10, 2025
Gala MIX Inc. ("Gala", “we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy rights of our users ("users" or "you").
This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information, including personal information, that you provide or we collect in connection with our applications (the “App”) and/or websites (collectively, the "Services").
Please note that this Statement applies only to the Services maintained by Gala or its affiliates, and not third party sites or services, whether linked to or from the Services. In addition, this Policy does not apply to other entities that we do not own or control or persons that are not our employees, agents or within our control.
By using the Services, you are expressing your agreement to this Policy and the processing of your data in the manner provided in this Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Services. You must be 16 years of age or older to use the Services.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
1. Information We Collect
When you access or use our Services, we may collect information about you as described below. Our primary goal is to limit the information we collect to the minimum, especially personal information, but some information is required to be able to provide you with a customized experience and to deliver and improve our Services.
Account Information:
When you first launch the App, we assign you an anonymous Account ID, but we do not require you to provide your name, email address or phone number. In addition, you may create a nickname to use some of the features of our Services. We strongly advise you not to choose a handle that contains personally identifiable information such as your name.
Device Information:
We collect certain information such as your device or mobile device identifiers, device advertising ID, device brand and model, operating system and version, last 20 IP addresses and corresponding connection date and time, and language information.
Content and Usage Information:
We collect any content you submit to the Services as well as information about the content, such as when you submitted it. We also collect information about your use of the Services, including App activity, App statistics and interactions with other user contents.
Other Information you Provide to Us:
When you interact with our Services or otherwise communicate with us in any way, we will collect the information you choose to share with us. For instance when you ask for assistance from our customer support team, we may collect and store the contact information you provide (generally includes but not limited to your e-mail address). We may store the correspondence and any information contained within. We also collect optional Account Information you provide, such as your height, weight and gender, which is used to estimate the distance walked and calories burned. We will also store your profile image if you choose to upload one. Finally we will collect your physical activity (your daily steps) and an anonymized Google Fit ID if you choose to use Google Fit in the App to count your steps. We do not access, collect or store any other data associated with your Google Fit account, such as your name, phone number, email, address, profile photo, etc.
Information Collected by Tracking Technologies:
We and our marketing and outsourcing partners use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies or trackers to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits. You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Services on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you may submit within the mobile application.
Other Information Collected with Permission:
Our mobile applications that are distributed through various "app" stores (including iOS and Android) may also request permission to automatically collect other information from your mobile device. We may only collect this information with your authorization in accordance with your device operating system's permission process.
2. Use of Information
In general, we use the information we collect from and about you to provide and operate the Services, respond to your requests, and to provide customer service and technical support. We may use the information we collect to:
Identify or to authenticate users.
Monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our Services.
Personalize and customize your experience while using our Services.
Send information about the Services, including push notification and alerts.
Deliver advertising and to track its result for our or third party's products and services.
Prevent spam or potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service.
Carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected.
If you choose to use Google Fit to count your steps, we will use your Google Fit ID only to retrieve your steps data from the Google Fit API. We do not use your Google user data for any other purpose. We do not sell, transfer, disclose or share your Google user data to any third party.
3. Sharing of Information
We are committed to ensuring your privacy and protecting the security of your personal information. We do not share information about you with third parties except in the following circumstances:

4. Analytics, Advertising and Other Third Party Services
We may allow third parties to serve advertisements in connection with our Services, to provide analytics services and provide you with other services, such as rewards programs. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about you on our Services and other websites and online services, such as your IP addresses, device manufacturer and operating system, identifiers associated with your mobile device or applications on the device, browser types and user activity. This information may be used by us, and these other companies and their customers and clients, to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests, and better understand your usage. Some of these third-party analytics and advertising services offer you a choice to opt out the collection of and/or sharing of this information; links to the opt-out mechanisms for the third parties that offer such a choice can be found in the "Your Choices" section below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third-party cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies.
5. Storage and Protection of Information
We take reasonable technical, physical and administrative measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Furthermore, our trusted vendors and business partners are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.
However, while we strive to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and there may be factors beyond our control that may result in disclosure of personal information. In particular, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining access to this information.
As a consequence, we disclaim any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of any personal information collected from users.
6. Your Choices
1. Access to Personal Information
You have a right to request access to any personal information that we hold in relation to you. You may also review, update, correct or delete your personal information collected by the Services. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. To access the personal information that we hold in relation to you or to review, update, correct or delete your personal information collected by the Services, please contact us at
info@winwalk.club
.
In order to have access to your personal information, you must provide a proof of identification such as account ID and/or information about your recent activity on the Services. We reserve the right to deny access to any user if we believe there is a doubt about your identity. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your personal information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. Moreover, we may still retain your information in our files to resolve disputes, enforce the Terms of Service, and for technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the Services. However, we will not use such personal information for any other purpose.
To delete your account data, please send us an email to info@winwalk.club specifying that you want to delete your account. We will contact you to confirm your request, and your account will be deleted within a few days.
You can also delete your account directly in the App, by visiting the Settings menu.

Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 16 in principle and we do not knowingly or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16.

Gala MIX Inc. is a company located in South Korea and its business operations are primarily conducted in South Korea. We operate our company and administer this Policy under applicable South Korean laws and regulations. If you use our service from outside South Korea, you are thereby consenting for your personal information to be processed in South Korea in the manner described in this Statement.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring
:

.
Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data
Firebase Service Data is personal information that Google collects and generates
during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.
Examples of Firebase Service Data include information about service usage,
resource identifiers like application IDs and package name/bundle IDs, technical
and operational details of usage such as IP addresses, and direct communications
with developers from feedback and support related conversations.

CCPA
GDPR
Certifications
Service Level Standards
As an industry-leading technology provider, we help enable compliance and ensure the security of your data and that of your customers. In today’s privacy-centric data economy, brands can form closer connections with consumers than ever before by building trusted relationships. Therefore, it is vital to protect information being shared across platforms and connected devices while also empowering consumers with choice.
CCPA
The
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
represents a significant shift in state-side consumer data privacy legislation, with implications for brands serving and targeting consumers in the state of California.
For answers to important questions about your business, Kochava, and the CCPA, visit our
CCPA FAQ.
CCPA requires brands to provide consumers with a comprehensive description of their online and offline practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of personal information and of the rights of consumers regarding their personal information. Privacy policies must be designed and presented in a way that is easy to read and understandable to an average consumer. Unlike Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which required app developers to “ask consumers for consent,” the CCPA requires developers to provide consumers a mechanism to “opt-out” from having their personal data sold, with stricter “opt-in” mechanisms for minors. Full legislation
here.
The CCPA took effect on January 1st, 2020, with enforcement commencing no later than July 1st, 2020.
Kochava complies with the CCPA in its capacity as a “service provider” in providing Kochava Measurement services.
As an acting member of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), Kochava is enacting the IAB’s
CCPA Compliance Framework
within our native measurement SDKs.
GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) creates consistent data protection rules across Europe. It applies to companies that are based in the EU and global companies like Kochava that process personal data about individuals in the EU. Kochava is, and will continue to be, compliant with all data privacy laws across the globe. We are committed to complying with GDPR legislation and collaborating with partners to facilitate compliance.
We thought it would be helpful to provide the context upon which Kochava delivers its services to clients in order for you to better understand how Kochava complies with GDPR and treats client data.
Kochava provides a number of different services to clients:
Kochava Measurement
A comprehensive set of data analytics and attribution tools
The characteristic Kochava Measurement client is a company that has created an app and wants to measure every aspect of an advertising campaign promoting it. The Kochava Measurement client enters into a contractual relationship with Kochava, which allows the client to embed Kochava software (an “SDK”) into its app. The client customizes the SDK to collect certain data derived from the app. Kochava processes this data on behalf of the client and visualizes it on a private dashboard for the client’s analysis. The client pays Kochava a fee for providing this service. The data remains the exclusive property of the client at all times.
Free App Analytics
A limited set of free data analytics and attribution tools.
The characteristic Free App Analytics (“FAA”) client is a company that has created an app and wants to measure the performance of an advertising campaign promoting it. The FAA client enters into a contractual relationship with Kochava, which allows the client to embed Kochava software (an “SDK”) into its app. The client customizes the SDK to collect certain data derived from the app. Kochava processes this data on behalf of the client and visualizes it on a private dashboard for the client’s analysis. Instead of the client paying Kochava a fee for this service, the FAA client allows Kochava to use the data for Kochava’s own purposes. There are two distinct differences between Kochava Measurement and FAA: (1) The FAA client has access to a limited set of data analytics tools, whereas the Kochava Measurement client has access to the full suite of tools; and (2) the FAA client receives the service free of charge in exchange for granting first-party data rights to Kochava, whereas the Kochava Measurement client pays Kochava a fee for services without granting additional data rights. Kochava does not, and will not, determine the purposes or means of processing personal data of European data subjects for any of its clients. As such, Kochava operates exclusively as a Data Processor under GDPR across each of its business units.

Role
Legal Basis
Kochava Measurement
Data Processor
Kochava processes data on behalf of its clients.
Free App Analytics
Data Processor
Kochava processes data on behalf of its clients.
In its capacity as a Data Processor, Kochava adheres to the rules of the GDPR as follows:
Data Protection by Design
The Kochava Measurement and FAA service platforms (“Platform”) are designed to enable clients to:
Determine which personal data the Platform processes;
Limit the collection of personal data to that which is adequate, relevant, and necessary for the purpose of which they are processed;
Manage the retention periods of personal data; and
Destroy personal data.
Data Protection by Default
The Platform is designed to:
Process personal information in conformance to the instructions provided by the client;
Collect only the personal data that are necessary for fulfilling the purposes of which they are processed;
Make personal data accessible only to a limited number of people whose job requires such access; and
Ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing personal data.
Collection of "Sensitive" Personal Data
Kochava contractually prohibits its clients from utilizing the Platform to collect, process, or otherwise handle sensitive personal data.
Data Retention
Kochava does not keep personal data any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is being processed. Kochava deletes personal data after a client’s contract has expired or has been terminated.
Incident Response
Kochava will continue to promptly inform clients of incidents involving personal data in line with the data incident terms in our current (and any subsequently updated) agreements. Kochava maintains, and will continue to invest in, advanced threat detection and avoidance technologies, as well as a rigorous 24/7 incident management program to help identify and respond to security or privacy events (and any personal data breaches under the GDPR) without delay.
Third-Party Audit
Kochava is audited annually by an independent third party against GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standards.
International Transfers
Kochava ingests client data to its cloud servers from locations across the world. Upon ingestion, Kochava transfers the data to its secure processing facility located in the United States. Kochava is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, which is a legal mechanism to enable the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to the US, where certified organizations guarantee to provide a level of protection in line with EU data protection law. See more
here.
Kochava also offers clients EU-approved Model Contract Clauses upon request.
Kochava will, in addition, continue to monitor the evolution of international data-transfer mechanisms under the GDPR, and is committed to having an ongoing lawful basis for data transfers in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
Subprocessing
Kochava does not subcontract any of its processing operations to a subprocessor in the absence of a written agreement which contractually obligates the subprocessor to adhere to all applicable GDPR data processing requirements.

In order to protect your privacy, Kochava has engineered its systems to not collect identifying information such as email, name, and phone number. However, GDPR considers mobile device identifiers and IP addresses to be “personal information.” A mobile device identifier is a unique string of 30+ numbers associated with your device (e.g., cell phone). An IP address is a series of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computing device using a particular “Internet Protocol” at a given time to communicate over a network.
If you are concerned that Kochava has this information, we will be happy to delete it from our systems upon request. You may submit a request to delete all your personal information by emailing Kochava at privacy@kochava.com or by contacting the legal department via telephone at 855-562-4282. However, please bear in mind that when you contact Kochava with such a request, because of the precautions we have proactively taken to protect your privacy, you are actually volunteering more personally identifying information to Kochava as a result of lodging the request than Kochava would have ever had prior to you initiating contact.
Opt Out Policy
Additional Terms
In its capacity as a processor of personal data, Kochava will ensure its contractual agreements with clients require the parties to adhere to the respective obligations of controllers and processors. Furthermore, Kochava will enter into data-processing agreements with clients where required.

Privacy
Data Protection
adjoe GmbH (hereinafter referred also to as “adjoe”) appreciates your interest in our enterprise and in our online appearances.
In principle, it is possible to use all of the adjoe’s websites and social media sites without providing any personal data that directly reveals your identity to us. However, if you as a user wish to make use of special services via our websites or our social media offerings, it may be necessary to process personal data. In addition, when you visit web services, certain information about your end devices or technical equipment is processed that does not allow any direct conclusion to be drawn about your identity, but which is legally considered personal data or is protected for other legal reasons. We strictly adhere to the legal requirements of data protection law and in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and other legal data protection reguflations. If it is necessary to process personal data and there is no legal basis for such processing, we will ask for your consent.
We would therefore like to take this opportunity to inform you which of your personal data we collect when you visit our website and other online media operated by us and for what purposes it is used. Information on all your rights and how to exercise them can be found in the following section “Your rights as a data subject” in this Data Protection Notice.

Insofar as individual websites and the processing of personal data therein is carried out under the joint accountability of various companies of the Applike group according to Articles 4 No. 7, 26 GDPR or individual companies as sole controllers according to Article 4 No. 7 GDPR, for the respective contact information on the controller(s), please refer to the imprint of the respective websites.
3. Personal data
Personal data is information about personal or factual circumstances of a specific or identifiable natural person. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number and date of birth, but also data about your specific career, etc., which can be assigned to a specific person with reasonable effort.
Information that is anonymized and not associated with your identity, however, is not personal data.
4. Purposes of the processing of personal data
Some of the personal data and further information we may collect from you is necessary to enable us to provide you with the services you request, to fulfil our contracts with you, to comply with legal requirements or if we have a legitimate interest in the use of your information, for example, when we use your personal data to be able to offer you an extensive and interesting offer via our websites and our web services and to constantly improve these.
When we collect data directly from you, we may ask you for your consent and clearly mark mandatory information (e.g. with an asterisk (*)). You voluntarily provide us with any other information that is not marked.
We will generally collect, process and use the personal data you provide online only within the legal bases provided for within the applicable data protection legislation or within the borders of your consent and as well only for the purposes disclosed to you.
5. General legal bases
The legal bases for the processing of your personal data may be the following:
Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6 para 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.
Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. c GDPR.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
6. Which personal data is collected and processed?
You can generally browse our websites without providing us with personal data (e.g. name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) that reveal your identity directly to us, unless you make them available to us voluntarily (e.g. for registrations for events, enquiries or surveys) or you have consented to the intended use or otherwise the corresponding legal provisions on the protection of your data permit the specific use of your personal data according to the aforementioned legal bases for specific purposes.
Particularly, your personal data may be used as follows:
6.1 Applications and the application procedures
If you are interested in working for our company, you can also apply for a position within adjoe GmbH and become part of our team. If you apply to us electronically, i.e. by e-mail or via our web form, we collect and process your personal data for the purpose of handling the application procedure and carrying out pre-contractual measures.
By submitting an application on our recruiting page and sending us your application documents, you express your interest in joining us to work for us and make your personal data available to adjoe for the purpose of applying for a specific position advertised by us. In this context, you provide us with personal data which we use and store exclusively for the purpose of your job search/application.
In particular, the following data is collected:
Your name (first and last name)
Your e-mail address
Your resume/CV
Salary expectations
Your possible start date
Information on how you heard about the vacant position
You also have the opportunity to upload relevant documents such as a cover letter, references and certificates, and further documents that you consider significant in the context of your application. These documents, just like CVs, may contain further personal data such as date of birth, address, etc.
Finally, you have to confirm that you have read our Data Protection Notice before submitting your application.
The scope of personal data that you need to provide to us as part of your application depends on the scope and type of your application or the position advertised with us. You are generally free to decide which data you provide us with. However, we may not be able to consider your application without certain information that is required in the individual case or according to the job posting. If necessary, please refer to the job posting for which you wish to apply to find out whether certain information is required.
We clearly mark mandatory information there (e.g., with an asterisk (*)). In these cases, you provide us with all other information not marked with an asterisk voluntarily.
Note on special categories of personal data
:
We would like to point out that job applications, in particular resumes, references and other data you send us, may contain particularly sensitive
information
about your state of health, your racial or ethnic origin, your political opinions, your religious or philosophical beliefs, your memberships in a trade union or political party, or your sex life. However, we do not request such data from you and you provide us with such information voluntarily and on the basis of your consent. This consent also relates to the processing of all personal data of a special nature submitted as part of your application in accordance with the provisions of this data protection declaration.
In the further course of the application process, we may also collect further data from you and process them, together with the information you provided in the course of your application, for the purposes stated here. This may also include our assessment of whether you are qualified and suitable for filling vacancies in our company.
If you apply to us, your any of the personal data you provide to us is stored and used exclusively for the purpose of filling the vacant position for which you have applied and to be able to contact you personally on the basis of your application and, if necessary, to initiate a possible employment relationship with you.
Only authorized employees from our personnel department or employees involved in the application process have access to your data. A transfer of your personal data to third parties or a use of your data for advertising purposes will not take place unless you have expressly consented to it. A use of your personal data beyond the uses mentioned in this Data Protection Notice does not take place.
Retention of your application data
Your data will generally be stored for a period of 180 days after the end of the application process. As a rule, this is done to fulfil legal obligations or to defend against any claims arising from legal regulations. We are then obliged to delete or anonymize your data. In this case, the data is only available to us as so-called metadata without direct personal reference for statistical evaluations (for example, proportion of applications regarding gender, number of applications per period, etc.).
The legal basis for this data processing is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR (which permits the processing of data to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures), in this context directed towards the conclusion of an employment contract with you and Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR (which permits the processing of data to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests), in this context, directed at our legitimate interest in being able to defend ourselves in the event of legal claims being brought against us on the basis of general equality legislation. With regard to the processing of (possibly special categories of) personal data provided in addition to the mandatory data, the legal basis is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR (which permits data processing on the basis of your consent).
Prolonged retention (“Talent Pool”)
In addition, and only with your specific consent to do so, we store your data for inclusion in the Applike group’s “Talent Pool” for 2 years after the end of the application process in order to identify any other interesting positions for you. This also applies, for example, to applications for training or internship positions.
In this case, we will continue to use all of the data collected from you as part of the application process in order to review your application in relation to vacancies at our company and other companies of the whole Applike group and in order to be able to contact you personally on the basis of your application, as well as to initiate a possible employment relationship with you, if applicable.
In the event that we are currently unable to offer you a position in our company, you can already request to be included in the Applike group’s “Talent Pool” in the course of your application and give the corresponding consent to the extended processing period of your application data.
In the event of extended storage of your data within the Applike group’s Talent Pool, the processing of your personal data is subject to joint controllership in accordance with Art. 26 GDPR. For all details in this context, please refer to the Data Protection Notice on the joint website of the companies of the Applike group.
You can revoke your consent to the use of your application data at any time with effect for the future. To do so, simply send an e-mail to the e-mail address
privacy@adjoe.io
. Your data will then be deleted from our applicant database; if deletion is not possible, blocking will take the place of deletion. In this case, we can no longer consider your application.
Additional charges (beyond the regular transmission fees of your Internet or telephone provider) will not be incurred for the revocation.
You are not obliged to consent to an extended storage of your application data in the Applike group’s “Talent Pool”. Without your consent, we are however unable to include you in our “Talent Pool” and must delete your application data in accordance with the requirements of Section 6.1.1 after completion of the initial application process.
The legal basis for this data processing is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR (which permits data processing on the basis of your consent).
Data processing within the scope of the employment relationship
If you receive and accept an offer of employment with us as part of the application process, we will store the personal data collected during the application process at least for the duration of the employment relationship.
The legal basis for this data processing is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR (which permits the processing of data to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures), in this context directed towards the conclusion of an employment contract with you and Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR (which permits the processing of data to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests), in this context, we use your personal data mainly for the purpose of establishing, implementing and, if necessary, processing and terminating the employment relationship entered into with you. You will be informed in detail about the processing of your personal data and the legal bases thereof within the scope of the employment relationship entered into with the companies of the Applike group when the employment contract is concluded.
6.2          Contact forms on our websites
For general inquiries and contact requests, please use our contact form at
https://adjoe.io/contact-us/
or send us an e-mail at
contact@adjoe.io
. When you contact us via our contact form or via e-mail, we use your personal data exclusively to answer your inquiries according to your requests and to your satisfaction. To do so, we generally process your full name (name and last name) and also e-mail address to reply to your individual inquiry. Further, it is generally your free decision which data you provide to us. However, we may not be able to fulfil your contact request without certain details required in individual cases.
The legal basis for this data processing is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR (which permits the processing of data to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures), Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR (which permits the processing of data to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests). Our legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR is the optimization and fulfilment of our online offers and our web services.
6.3          Server-Log files
Your visit to our websites is automatically logged by our web servers. In connection with the retrieval of the information you requested from our web services, data is collected for the provision of our various services or for evaluation and security purposes and, if necessary, stored in anonymized form (without personal reference). The web servers we use automatically store data about the retrieval of our web services in so-called server log files. These are the following data:
Your IP address
The URLs you access on our web pages
Referrer URL (the page from which you visit us)
Time of the server request
Host name of the accessing terminal (the name of your Internet service provider)
Browser type and browser version
Operating system used and its settings
The processing of the above data is done for security purposes, for general fraud prevention and as a precaution against attacks on our web services. An automated combination of this data with data from other data sources does not take place.
If we also automatically log your IP address, this is automatically deleted after 30 days at the latest .
Furthermore, we store the URL accessed with the associated page title and optional information on the page content; information on the terminal device used, operating system and browser. This information is generally transmitted with each individual page request when using the Internet. However, unlike cookies and similar technologies, no information is read from the memory of the user’s terminal device and no information is stored on this terminal device.
Since the privacy of our visitors is important to us, this data is processed without being merged with other data provided by you, such as your contact details, and furthermore, data that may allow a reference to an individual person, such as the IP address, login or device identifiers, are anonymized or pseudonymized immediately after collection by deleting the last number block. No other use, combination with other data or disclosure to third parties takes place.
This data processing is based on the legal basis of Article 6 para.1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR, which allows data processing based on our legitimate interest. Our legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR is the optimization and technical security of our online offers and our web services.
Apart from that, only general information is recorded, e.g. when which content from our offer is called up or which pages are visited most frequently, the names of the requested files as well as their call-up date and time. These data are evaluated to improve our offer and do not allow any conclusions about your person. We will not use this information for any other purpose.
The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR, which allows the processing of data to protect the legitimate interests of the data controller.
7.             Our social media appearances
We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found below.
7.1          Data processing through social networks
Social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Stack Overflow, X, Medium and MeetUp can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or banner ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:
If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.
Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.
7.2          Legal bases
Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g., consent within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR).
7.3          Responsibility and assertion of rights
If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Stack Overflow, X, Medium and MeetUp), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Stack Overflow, X, Medium and MeetUp).
Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.
7.4          Storage time
The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular, retention periods – remain unaffected.
We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators for their own purposes. Particularly cookies and similar techniques stored on your device by the respective social media provider may remain until you delete them (please refer to the following section 8 of this Data Protection Notice for further information on the cookies that we use on our website). For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g., in their privacy policy, see below).

8.             Cookies and similar technologies
Within our websites and with your consent, we also may use cookies as well as other similar technologies (hereinafter collectively referred to as “cookies”) from third party providers.
We do not use any cookies ourselves in our social media profiles mentioned in section 7 of this Data Protection Notice. With regard to the use of such technologies by the respective providers of these social media platforms, we kindly ask you to inform yourself in this regard under the specified information sources supplied by the providers themselves.
8.1 General information about cookies
The use of cookies helps us make it more convenient for you to use our website. For example, we use session cookies to detect whether you have already visited individual pages on our website. These are erased automatically when you leave our website.
Other Cookies help us to collect information about how you behave as a user on our website and how you interact with the features we offer. We do this to better understand how our website is used and to enable improved navigation and features. Cookies that we use will not allow to identify you personally. However, with the help of these cookies we can – with your consent – re-identify the device you use or your web browser when you repeatedly access our web offer and thus optimise your experience as a user of our website and make it more comfortable by adapting the presentation of the content to your particular interests or your preferences and designing it individually and according to your needs. Cookies therefore also allow us to recognise whether you have visited our website before or whether you are a new visitor.
For these purposes, we use cookies and similar technologies from the third-party providers listed in Section 8.2 below. And your personal data may also be processed by the named third-party providers as described in detail.
Detailed information on cookies in general, the types of cookies and their intended use, as well as on the relevant legal basis for the use of cookies and on your selection and control options for the cookies used in detail within our websites can be found in our detailed instructions within our
PRIVACY PREFERENCES MANAGER
, which generally also opens automatically when you access our websites for the first time and within which you can adapt the use of cookies and similar technologies to your wishes and needs.
When you click
here
or on the cookie link in the footer, you can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future or change your cookie preferences without this resulting in any legal disadvantages for you.
You also may refuse the use of cookies (at all) by selecting the appropriate settings of your browser, however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our websites.
8.2          Third party provider services we use on our websites
Our websites use services (including cookies and similar technologies) from the third-party providers listed below and your personal data may also be processed by the named third-party providers as described in detail:
8.2.1
Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
On our websites we use Google Analytics 4 (GA4), a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. (“Google”).
In this context, pseudonymized usage profiles are created and cookies are used. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website can be, among other things:
a short-term recording of the IP address without, permanent storage
Browser information,
Date and time of access,
Device information,
The URL of the visited website,
Geographic location,
The pseudonymized data may be transferred by Google to a server in the USA and stored there.
The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website and internet use for the purposes of market research and demand-oriented design of these internet pages. This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on our behalf. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data.
These processing operations are carried out exclusively when consent is given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR.
The parent company Google LLC is certified as a US company under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. There is hereby an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR, so that a transfer of personal data may also take place without further guarantees or additional measures. With regard to data transfers outside the EU or the EEA, please also refer to the information in section 13 (“Data transfers to “Third Countries”).
Additional information on the service can be found at the following link:
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12017362?hl=de
.
8.2.2
Additional information on Google Signals
Google Signals is a feature in Google Analytics that collects session data from websites and apps where users are logged in with their Google Account and have enabled personalized advertising. It enables advanced analysis by linking user behavior across different devices and providing additional information such as demographic characteristics and interests. Your consent to the use of Google Analytics (see above) also includes consent to the Google Signals add-on function.
Additional information on Consent Mode, advanced implementation
Under the Digital Markets Act, Google is obliged to obtain user consent before processing user data for personalized advertising. Google fulfils this requirement with the “Consent Mode”. Users are obliged to implement this and thus prove that they have obtained the consent of website visitors.
Google offers two implementation modes, the basic and the advanced implementation.
We use the extended implementation method of Google Consent Mode. If you consent to data processing in connection with the use of GA4 (see above), a connection to Google is established, Google Analytics cookies are set and the corresponding processing is carried out. If you refuse consent, no Google Analytics cookies will be set. However, a unique “ping ID” will be generated and transmitted to Google. The Google code is executed, whereby only limited user data is transmitted to Google, including information such as:
IP address
Browser details
Visited URL
A personalised user ID is not assigned.
If you have consented to the execution of Google Analytics 4, Consent Mode, extended implementation, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR. In addition, it is in our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR to use Google Analytics 4, Consent Mode, extended implementation, in order to obtain data on conversions without creating user profiles and thus increase profitability.
By consenting to the use of Google Analytics, you also consent to your data being processed in the United States of America (USA) in accordance with Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The USA has been assessed by the European Court of Justice as a country with an insufficient level of data protection according to EU standards. In particular, there is a risk that your data may be processed by US authorities for control and monitoring purposes, possibly without any legal remedy. If you do not consent to the use of this service, the transfer described above will not take place.
We request your consent with the help of our
PRIVACY PREFERENCES MANAGER
, within which you can also revoke your consent at any time and adapt your settings to your wishes and needs at any time with effect for the future, without this causing you any disadvantages.
8.2.3     Google Maps
Within our websites, we may use map service Google Maps via an API. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
For the use of the functions of Google Maps, it is necessary to store your IP address. This information will generally be sent to a Google server in the USA, where it will be stored. The provider of this site has no influence on this data transfer.
If you consent to the execution of Google Maps the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR.
By consenting to the use of Google Maps, you also consent to your data being processed in the United States of America (USA) in accordance with Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The USA has been assessed by the European Court of Justice as a country with an insufficient level of data protection according to EU standards. In particular, there is a risk that your data may be processed by US authorities for control and monitoring purposes, possibly without any legal remedy. If you do not consent to the use of this service, the transfer described above will not take place.
We request your consent with the help of our
PRIVACY PREFERENCES MANAGER
, within which you can also revoke your consent at any time and adapt your settings to your wishes and needs at any time with effect for the future, without this causing you any disadvantages.
8.2.4     Consent Management Tool (Borlabs Cookies)
To collect and manage your consent to the use of cookies we use the consent management tool “Borlabs” from Borlabs GmbH, Hamburger Str. 11, 22083 Hamburg, Germany. This tool allows us to obtain and manage the consent of website users for data processing.
Borlabs collects data generated by end users who use our website. When an end user gives consent via the cookie consent tool, Borlabs automatically logs the following data:
Browser information,
Date and time of access,
Device information,
The URL of the visited website,
Banner language,
Consent ID,
The consent status of the end user, which serves as proof of consent.
The consent status is also stored in the end user’s browser so that the website can automatically read and follow the end user’s consent in all subsequent page requests and future end user sessions for up to 12 months. Consent data (consent and withdrawal of consent) is stored for three years. The retention period corresponds to the regular limitation period according to § 195 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch [BGB]). The data is then deleted immediately.
The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the described processing. There is no possibility for the user to object as long as there is a legal obligation to obtain the user’s consent to certain data processing operations (Art. 7 para. 1, Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR).
Borlabs GmbH acts as a data processor for us.
9. Period for which the personal data will be stored
We only store personal data that you provide to us for as long as they are needed to fulfil the purposes for which these data were provided or as long as this is required by law:
If you conclude contracts with us, we store and process your personal data for the duration of your contractual relationship with us and also for the fulfilment of legal post-contractual archiving obligations and for the duration of the statutory retention periods (maximum 10 years);
If you apply through us for vacant positions with us, we will delete your application data at the latest 180 days after completion of the application procedure, unless you have given us your consent to store your data two more years in the talent pool for future job vacancies;
If you send us an inquiry, we process your personal data for the duration of processing your inquiry and for the period we may need to document the inquiry process and our answers.
Generally, we delete or anonymize your personal data from our systems and records, so that you can no longer be identified, when they are no longer needed. We may retain certain personal data in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations and to enable us to administer our rights (e.g. to enforce our claims in court), or for statistical purposes (in anonymous form).
10. With whom do we share Personal Data?
If these cases are not listed in this Data Protection Notice, we will not sell or market your personal data to third parties or forward them on for any other reason.
In addition to the other cases mentioned in this Data Protection Notice, your personal data will only be passed on without your express prior consent in the following cases:
If it is necessary for the clarification of an illegal or abusive of our web services or for the prosecution, personal data are passed on to the prosecution authorities as well as if necessary, to damaged third parties. However, this only happens if there are concrete indications of illegal or abusive behaviour. A disclosure to third parties bound to professional secrecy can take place if this is necessary to enforce the contractual conditions or other agreements as well as our claims arising from contracts that you have concluded with us. The legal basis for data transmission is Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures and Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests.
Further, we may also be legally obliged to provide information to certain public authorities upon request. These are law enforcement authorities, authorities that prosecute fined offences and the tax authorities.
As our business develops, the structure of our company may change as its legal form changes, subsidiaries, parts of companies or components are established, purchased or sold. In such transactions, customer information will be shared with the part of the company to be transferred with your consent. Whenever personal data is passed on to third parties to the extent described above, we will ensure that it is used in accordance with this data protection declaration and the relevant data protection laws and ask you for your consent.
11. Who is involved in processing your Personal Data?
We process your personal data collected through the website and may also engage third parties to assist us according to our instructions and therefore, your personal data can also be processed on our behalf by our reliable, external service providers (“contract processors”). We solely rely on trusted and reliable contract processors who conduct a number of business processes on our behalf and only provide them with the information they need to provide their services to us. We make every effort to ensure that all contract providers with whom we work strictly protect your personal data and use them only for the purposes to which we assign them and on our behalf. For example, we can commission the following services for which the processing of your personal data is necessary to our contract processors or our contract processors may be
Third parties who support and help us to provide digital and e-commerce services, including CRM, web analytics and search engine and user content maintenance tools;
Advertising, marketing, digital and social media agencies to assist us with advertising, marketing and campaign activities, to analyse their effectiveness and to manage your contact requests and questions;
Third parties who assist us in providing IT services, including platform providers, hosting services, maintenance and support for our databases, and our software and applications that contain information about you (in some cases, such services simply include access to your data to perform the desired task);
Particularly, the data provided in the context of your application will be transmitted via TLS encryption and is stored in a database within a cloud-based system for online applications and to carry out the application process. The Applike Group uses a cloud-based system (“Lever”) from the specialized provider Employ, Inc., 20 North Meridian Street, Suite # 300, Indianapolis, IN 46204, USA for the online application and the implementation of the application process. This is the service provider for the employer and may also receive knowledge of personal data of the applicants in connection with the maintenance and maintenance of the systems. The Applike group has concluded a data processing agreement according to Article 28 GDPR with this provider, which ensures that the data processing is only carried out in accordance with the Applike group’s instructions and in a permissible manner, and that the data is not passed on to third parties. The data processed by Employ, Inc. is hosted in the EU. Employ, Inc. collects and processes personal data exclusively in accordance with the instructions received or the consent of the employer and in accordance with the applicable data protection laws. Where necessary, Employ, Inc. transfers personal data in individual cases to group companies and suppliers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. For data transfers to the US, the provider has joined the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which ensures compliance with the European data protection level on the basis of an adequacy decision by the European Commission. Further information on this is available from the provider at the following link:
https://www.lever.co/privacy-notice/
.
The legal basis for data transmission is Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures and Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests.
We have concluded a contract with all our contract processors on the commissioned data processing on our behalf in accordance with Article 28 GDPR and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using their services.
12. Data transfers to “Third Countries”
If we process data in a Third Country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies, this is only done in accordance with the strict legal requirements of the EU and we ensure that your data is treated in accordance with the provisions of this Data Protection Notice.
Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we only process or have the data processed in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation through the so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission (SCC), in the presence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations according to Articles 44 to 49 GDPR; further information can be found on the websites of the EU Commission under the URL
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en
. Where necessary, we and our contract processors will, where applicable, also take supplementary measures to ensure the protection of your privacy rights, the confidentiality of your personal data and compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of the EU.
13. Data Security
We make every effort to take extensive technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data against unintentional or unlawful deletion, alteration or loss and against unauthorized disclosure or access. All our employees are accordingly bound to secrecy and data protection. Insofar as it is within our sphere of influence, we use modern encryption techniques and a large number of other measures in particular to prevent unauthorized access by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption exists, the data you exchange with us cannot be read by third parties.
Further, our security precautions are regularly checked and adapted to technological progress.
However, we would like to point out that due to the structure of the Internet, it is possible that the rules of data protection and the above-mentioned security measures may not be observed by other persons or institutions for which we are not responsible. In particular, unencrypted data can be accessed by third parties – particularly if this is done by e-mail. We have no technical influence on this. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the user to protect the data provided by him against misuse by encryption or in any other way.
14.          Your Rights as a Data Subject
If we process personal data as the data controller, you as the data subject have certain rights under Chapter III of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), depending on the legal basis and purpose of the processing, in particular the right of access (Article 15 GDPR), the right to rectification (Article16 GDPR), the right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) (Article 17 GDPR), the right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR), the right to data portability (Article 20 GDPR), the right to object (Article 21 GDPR). If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to revoke this data protection consent in accordance with Article 7 para. 3 GDPR.
If you wish to exercise your above rights, please contact us using the contact details given in section 2 of this Data Protection Notice.
Please note that we may require proof of identity and full details of your request before we can process your request.

AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “AppLovin”) operates a suite of tools for app developers and other businesses to automate and optimize the marketing and monetization of their platforms, products, or services by enabling the placement of different types of advertisements on digital properties including mobile apps, websites, and connected TV devices (collectively, the “Advertising Services” or “Services”).  As explained below, consumers interact with us in a few ways, primarily through advertisements served by AppLovin on behalf of advertisers.
The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our Services and advertising platform, and our corporate website at www.applovin.com (the “Website”), as well as your choices related to that information.

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.
General Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer who downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services through advertisements served within a digital property, we may collect certain information, including the following:
Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;
Carrier;
Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);
Network connection type and speed;
IP Address;
Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services;
HTTP header information;
Advertising IDs (IDFA/GAID/Amazon FOSAID);
Vendor IDs (IDFV);
App Set IDs; and
Advertising and tracking preferences and restrictions.
Application publishers may choose to share with us additional information including your age or year of birth, gender, email, phone number, and interest segments for purposes of their own direct ad serving.  We do not retain this data or pass it downstream to advertising partners.  Please see the applicable publisher’s privacy policy for more information about their use of first party data.
Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here
, current as of the date listed at the top of that page.
If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, please see the
“Manage Your Privacy Choices”
section below. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or Switzerland, you may also see the
“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.
Manage Your Privacy Choices:

).  You may still receive ads after limiting processing of information for interest-based advertising, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.

If you believe we have served an advertisement to a child or might have any personal information from or about a child, or if you believe a mobile application in which an AppLovin-served advertisement appeared may be designed for, directed to, or pass personal information knowingly from, children in violation of our policies, please contact us via email at
dataprotection@applovin.com
.
Data Security and Retention
We implement reasonable measures to help secure the information we collect through the Services. We retain the data we collect through the Services for up to 2 years.

AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.

To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

No method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is fully secure, and any data you transmit is at your own risk.

What are personal data?
The term personal data is defined in the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (Federal Data Protection Act) and the GDPR. According to these laws, these are individual details about personal or factual circumstances of a specific or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, your civil name, your address, your telephone number or your date of birth. Find out more about what exactly data protection is
here
.
Scope of anonymous data collection and data processing
Unless otherwise stated in the following sections, no personal data is collected, processed or used when using our websites. However, by using analysis and tracking tools, we learn certain technical information based on the data transmitted by your browser (e.g. browser type/version, operating system used,
web pages visited on our website incl. length of stay
, previously visited website). We evaluate this information for statistical purposes only.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data
Where we obtain
the consent
of the data subject for processing operations involving personal data, Art. 6 (1) lit. a) EU Genereal Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party. This also applies to processing operations necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.
Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) lit. c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
In cases where vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make it necessary to process personal data, Art. 6 (1) lit. d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
If the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the former interest, Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.
Creation of log files
With each call of the Internet page the BitBurst GmbH collects data and information by an automated system. These are stored in the log files of the server. The data is also stored in the log files of our system. These data are not stored together with other personal data of the user.
(1) Information about the type of browser and the version used
(2) The user's operating system
(3) The user's Internet service provider
(4) The user's IP address
(5) The date and time of access
(6) Websites from which the user's system accesses our website (referrer)
(7) Websites that are accessed by the user's system via our website
Routine deletion and blocking of personal data
The controller shall process and store personal data relating to the data subject only for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose of storage. In addition, data may be stored for as long as this is provided for by the European or national legislator in Union regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. As soon as the storage purpose ceases to apply or a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned regulations expires, the personal data is routinely blocked or deleted.
Rights of the data subject
If your personal data is processed, you are the data subject within the meaning of the GDPR and you are entitled to the following rights in relation to the person responsible:
Right of access by the data subject acc. to Art. 15 GDPR
You can request confirmation from the person responsible as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed by us. If such processing is carried out, you may ask the controller for information on:
the purposes for which the personal data are processed;
the categories of personal data processed;
the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your personal data have been or will be disclosed;
the planned duration of storage of your personal data or, if it is not possible to give specific details, criteria for determining the duration of storage
the existence of a right to rectification or erasure of your personal data, a right to have the processing limited by the controller or a right to object to such processing
the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority;
all available information on the origin of the data when the personal data are not collected from the data subject;
the existence of automated decision making, including profiling, in accordance with Art. 22, (1) and (4) GDPR and, at least in these cases, meaningful information on the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing on the data subject.
You have the right to request information whether your personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organization. In this context, you may request to be informed of the appropriate guarantees in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR in connection with the transfer.
Right to rectification acc. to Art. 16 GDPR
You have the right to obtain from the data controller the rectification and/or integration of any personal data processed concerning you if it is incorrect or incomplete. The data controller shall make the correction without delay.
Right to erasure acc. to Art. 17 GDPR
(1) You may request the controller to delete your personal data immediately and the controller is obliged to delete such data immediately if one of the following reasons applies:
The personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
You revoke your consent on which the processing was based in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR and there is no other legal basis for the processing.
You object to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 (1) GDPR and there are no legitimate reasons for the processing which take precedence, or you object to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 (2) GDPR.
The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully
The deletion of personal data concerning you is necessary to comply with a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States to which the controller is subject.
The personal data concerning you have been collected in relation to information society services offered, in accordance with Art. 8 (1) GDPR.
(2) If the controller has made your personal data public and is obliged to delete them in accordance with Art. 17 (1) GDPR, he shall take reasonable measures, including technical measures, taking into account the available technology and implementation costs, to inform data controllers who process the personal data that you, as a data subject, have requested them to delete all links to these personal data or copies or replications of these personal data.
(3) The right to erasure shall not apply where the processing is necessary
for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information;
to comply with a legal obligation to which the processing is subject under Union or national law to which the controller is subject, or to carry out a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
for reasons of public interest relating to public health pursuant to Art. 9 (2) (h) and i as well as Art. 9 (3) GDPR;
for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 (1) GDPR, insofar as the right referred to in para. 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the attainment of the objectives of such processing, or
to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
Right to restriction of processing acc. to Art. 18 GDPR
Under the following conditions, you may request the restriction of the processing of your personal data:
if you dispute the accuracy of your personal data for a period of time that allows the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
if the processing is unlawful and you refuse to delete the personal data and instead request the restriction of the use of the personal data;
if the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you need them for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
if you have lodged an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons of the controller outweigh your reasons.
If the processing of your personal data has been restricted, these data - apart from their storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of major public interest of the Union or a Member State. If the restriction on processing has been restricted in accordance with the above conditions, you will be informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.
Notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing acc. to Art. 19 GDPR
If you have exercised the right to rectify, erase or limit the processing, the controller is obliged to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this rectification, erasure or limitation of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed of these recipients by the controller.
Right to data portability acc. to Art. 20 GDPR
You have the right to receive your personal data, which you have provided to the responsible person, in a structured, common and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transfer this data to another responsible party without hindrance by the responsible party to whom the personal data has been made available, if
the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR and
the processing is carried out using automated procedures. In exercising this right, you also have the right to request that your personal data be transferred directly from one responsible party to another, insofar as this is technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons may not be impaired by this. The right to data transferability shall not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
Right of objection acc. to Art. 21 GDPR
You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The controller will no longer process your personal data unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. If your personal data is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data for such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes. You have the possibility, in connection with the use of information society services - notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC - to exercise your right to object by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.
Automated decision in individual cases including profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This does not apply if the decision
is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the controller,
is permitted by legal provisions of the Union or the Member States to which the controller is subject, and these legal provisions contain appropriate measures to protect your rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests, or
is done with your explicit consent.
However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Art. 9 (1) GDPR, unless Art. 9 (2) (a) or (g) applies and appropriate measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests.
With regard to the cases mentioned in a. and c., the controller shall take reasonable steps to safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests, which include, at a minimum, the right to obtain the intervention of a person on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to object to the decision.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority acc. to Art. 77 GDPR
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, place of employment or place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR. The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged will inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Art. 78 GDPR.
Duration of storage of personal data
Personal data is stored for the duration of the respective legal retention period. After expiry of the period, the data is routinely deleted, unless it is necessary for the initiation or fulfilment of a contract.

hellotrust
Description and purpose
We use the features of hellotrust (Keyed GmbH, Siemensstr. 12, 48341 Altenberge, Germany) on our website. hellotrust provides a legally required cookie notice and allows the operator to manage opt-in and opt-out via a cookie consent manager. To determine which tools are used, the website is scanned by the hellotrust crawler. Subsequently, the scanned information flows into the Cookie Note/Cookie Consent Manager.
Legal basis
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR.
Recipient
The recipient of your personal data is Keyed GmbH (Siemensstr. 12, 48341 Altenberge, Germany).
Transfer to third countries
There is no transfer of your personal data to a third country. However, we are aware of our responsibility and regularly review the framework conditions and legal changes. Should a transfer to a third country occur, we will update this information as soon as possible.

Further information on data protection
Here you will find further information on processing of your personal data:
https://hellotrust.de/datenschutz/
Data transmission to third countries
The controller may transfer personal data to a third country. In principle, the controller may provide various appropriate safeguards to ensure that an adequate level of protection is provided for the processing operations. It is possible to transfer data transfers on the basis of an adequacy finding, internal data protection rules, approved codes of conduct, standard data protection clauses or an approved certification mechanism pursuant to Art. 46 (2) (a) - (f) GDPR.
If the person responsible undertakes a transfer to a third country on the legal basis of Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR, you will be informed at this point about the possible risks of a data transfer to a third country.
There is a risk that the third country receiving your personal data may not provide an equivalent level of protection compared to the protection of personal data in the European Union. This may be the case, for example, if the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision for the third country in question or if certain agreements between the European Union and the third country in question are declared invalid. Specifically, there are risks in some third countries with regard to the effective protection of EU fundamental rights through the use of monitoring laws (e.g. USA). In such a case, it is the responsibility of the controller and the recipient to assess whether the rights of data subject in the third country enjoy a level of protection equivalent to that in the Union and can be effectively enforced.
However, the basic data protection regulation should not undermine the level of protection of natural persons ensured throughout the Union when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organizations, even if personal data are further transferred from a third country or from an international organization to controllers or processors in the same or another third country or to the same or another international organization.
Integration of other third-party services and content
Description and purpose
It can happen that within this online offer contents of third parties, such as videos, fonts or graphics from other websites are integrated. This always requires that the providers of these contents (hereinafter referred to as "third party providers") are aware of the IP address of the users. Without the IP address, they would not be able to send the content to the browser of the respective user. The IP address is therefore necessary for the display of this content. We make every effort to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only to deliver the content. However, we have no influence on this if the third-party providers store the IP address for statistical purposes, for example. As far as we are aware of this, we inform the users about it. We would like to provide and improve our online offer through these integrations.
Legal basis
The legal basis for the integration of other services and content of third parties is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our overriding legitimate interest lies in the intention of an appropriate presentation of our online presence and user-friendly and economically efficient services on our part. For further information, please refer to the respective privacy statements of the providers.
Contractual or legal obligation to provide personal data
The provision of personal data is neither legally nor contractually required and is also not necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide the personal data. However, failure to provide it may mean that you are unable to use this function or cannot use it to its full extent.

Applications
By submitting their application to us, applicants agree to the processing of their data for the purposes of the application procedure in accordance with the type and scope described in this data protection declaration. The legal basis for the processing of applicant data is Art. 88 GDPR, § 26 BDSG-neu (Federal Data Protection Act) and
Art. 9 (2) (b) GDPR
.
Ins
ofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art. 9 (1) GDPR are voluntarily communicated as part of the application procedure, they will also be processed in accordance with Art. 9 (2) (b) GDPR (e.g. health data, such as severely disabled status or ethnic origin). Insofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art. 9 (1) GDPR are requested from applicants within the framework of the application procedure, their processing is additionally carried out in accordance with Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR (e.g. health data if these are necessary for the exercise of the profession). If made available, applicants can submit their applications to us by means of an online form on our website. The data will be transmitted to us in encrypted form according to the state of the art. Applicants can also send us their applications by e-mail. Please note, however, that e-mails are generally not encrypted and that applicants must ensure that they are encrypted themselves. We can therefore not assume any responsibility for the transmission path of the application between the sender and the receipt on our server and therefore recommend rather to use an online form or the postal dispatch. This is because instead of applying via the online form and e-mail, applicants still have the option of sending us their application by post. In the event of a successful application, the data provided by the applicants can be processed by us for the purposes of the employment relationship. Otherwise, if the application for a job offer is not successful, the applicants' data is deleted. Applicants' data is also deleted if an application is withdrawn, which applicants are entitled to do at any time. The data will be deleted after the expiry of a period of six months so that we can answer any follow-up questions regarding the application and meet our obligations to provide evidence under the General Equal Treatment Act. Invoices for any reimbursement of travel expenses will be archived in accordance with tax law requirements.
Contact opportunities
On the internet pages of BitBurst GmbH
there is a contact form which can be used for electronic contact. Alternatively, it is possible to contact us via the provided e-mail address. If the data subject contacts the data controller via one of these channels, the personal data transmitted by the data subject is automatically stored. The storage is solely for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. The data will not be passed on to third parties. The legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR if the user has given his or her consent. The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an e-mail is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. If the e-mail contact is aimed at the conclusion of a contract, the additional legal basis for processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. For personal data from the input mask of the contact form and those sent by e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with the user has ended. The conversation is terminated when it can be concluded from the circumstances that the matter in question has been finally clarified. The personal data additionally collected during the sending process will be deleted after a period of seven days at the latest.
Newsletter
If the newsletter of our company is subscribed to, the data in the respective input mask will be transmitted to the person responsible for processing. The subscription to our newsletter is carried out in a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after registration you will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with foreign e-mail addresses. When registering for the newsletter, the IP address of the user and the date and time of registration are stored. This serves to prevent abuse of the services or the e-mail address of the person concerned. The data will not be passed on to unauthorized third parties. For the purpose of sending the newsletter, however, necessary data could be transmitted to appropriate service providers. Furthermore, an exception exists if there is a legal obligation to pass on the data. The data is used exclusively for sending the newsletter. The subscription to the newsletter can be cancelled by the person concerned at any time. Likewise, the consent to the storage of personal data can be revoked at any time. For this purpose there is a corresponding link in every newsletter. The legal basis for the processing of the data after registration for the newsletter by the user is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR if the user has given his consent. The legal basis for the dispatch of the newsletter as a result of the sale of goods or services is § 7 (3) Act against Unfair Competition (UWG).
Data Recipients
To the extent permitted or required by law, or to the extent you have consented, we will also share your personal data with other recipients who provide services on our behalf. We limit the disclosure of your personal data to the extent necessary. In some cases, our service providers receive your personal data as processors and are then strictly bound by our instructions when handling your personal data (data protection agreements pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR). In some cases, the recipients act independently with your data that we transfer to them. Subsequent categories of service providers/recipients may receive your data:

About Us
ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“ironSource Mobile”) operates 4 main services:
Ad Network
– A platform that allows app developers to serve ads within their apps, and advertisers to promote their products, and services within apps.
Mediation Platform
– A platform that helps app developers to manage all the ad providers with which they have a direct relationship (e.g. ironSource Mobile ad network, “third party” ad networks, additional online advertising companies, etc.) that serve ads on their apps.
Analytics Platform –
A platform that allows app developers to receive insights on their apps.
Ad Quality Platform
–
A platform that allows app developers to monitor advertising content displayed within their apps.
In addition, as of November 2022, Unity Technologies has been added as a corporate affiliate of ironSource Mobile Ltd. To view Unity’s privacy policy, please click
here
We collect information in either of 2 ways:
Directly
– through our SDKs integrated by app developers in their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information directly from such apps.
Indirectly
– through other third party mediation platforms with which we engage in order to serve ads in apps, or by receiving information from our advertisers, or affiliates.
Scope:
This privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with respect to information it processes through its Ad Network, Mediation Platform, Analytics Platform and Ad Quality Platform. This privacy policy does not govern the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for advertisers.
ironSource Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connetecuit and Utah, please see “State Privacy Rights” section of this privacy policy for information related to privacy laws in these states.
Information We Collect:
Information collected through our Ad Network (“Ad Network Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, and a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”), or . The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising companies to recognize a device across apps, for advertising purposes. You can find additional information about how to limit our use of the Advertising ID under “How to Control Your Information”.
General technical information about a device: Technical information such as the device’s time zone, the amount of free memory on the device, the name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status, operating system name and version,  the language of the operating system, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection type (e.g. WiFi), etc.
Campaign information: An indication if an ad was viewed, or clicked, or if there was an install of an advertised app. Information about actions performed within an advertiser’s app following such an install, such as in-app purchases, and level in the game (if the advertiser chooses to provide such information).
Information collected through our Mediation Platform (“Mediation Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer.
General technical information as described above.
Data provided by the app developers (if they choose to provide it) – The app developer can choose to share with us the following information: age, gender, in-app purchases, advance in the game, and such other information provided by the app developer.
Information collected by our Analytics Platform (“Analytics Information”)
Identifiers: a self-created ID unique to a specific app.
App events: Events set by the app developer that occurred within the app.
General technical data about the device.
Information collected by our Ad Quality Platform (“Ad Quality Information”)
Identifiers: a self-created ID unique to a specific app.
Advertising content: The ads displayed within the app, and interactions with such ads.
General technical data about the device.
How We Use the Information We Collect:
As stated above, we provide 4 main services. For each such service, we use the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general description of how we use information across our services:
Operating our Ad Network
– We use Ad Network Information to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting, billing and attribution: We use Ad Network Information to generate reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Network Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud detection and prevention: We use Ad Network Information for detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.
Optimization and frequency capping: We use Ad Network Information for optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of ads you view in a specific app.
Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in, or from their advertising campaigns.
Operating our ad marketplace. We use Ad Network Information to allow the third party advertising companies listed
here
to bid on ad inventory.
Operating our Mediation Platform
– We use Mediation Information to operate our mediation platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our mediation platform in order to allow them to better understand their audience in terms of interaction with ads.
Segmentation: We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content of the ads served by different networks.
Sending ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network Information.
Operating our Analytics Platform
– We use Analytics Information to operate our Analytics Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Analytics Platform in order to allow them to better understand the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Analytics Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Operating our Ad Quality Platform
– We use Ad Quality Information to operate our Ad Quality Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Ad Quality Platform in order to allow them to see which ads were served within their apps, and how such ads affected the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Quality for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.

Our Privacy Principles for the use of data about Targeted End Users
Liftoff’s systems aggregate events/data at granularities that cover many users, as opposed to a specific user, unless the user consents. For instance: users with iPhone X’s in San Francisco have clicked on ads in app A 100 times and installed app B 50 times.
Liftoff does not tie together events/data across apps in a user-specific way, without the user’s consent. For instance: we do not track that a person did X in app A and also Y in app B from a different publisher, if the person opts-out of interest-based advertising.
Instead, Liftoff only ties events/data from a given specific user within the context of a given app. E.g. user with app-local ID 123 installed app A, then finished the tutorial, then made a purchase.
This allows Liftoff to understand the conversion rates from one event to another within an app, but not track the activities of a user across different apps.
Liftoff does not record or store personal information that the user cannot easily revoke, such as email address, physical address, photographs or phone number to personalize our advertising. Liftoff relies upon device IDs to uniquely identify a user, and Liftoff solely relies upon the user’s consent in allowing Liftoff to access this information.
Liftoff does not export per-user data outside of Liftoff, except for validation purposes to a company that already has access to that data
Details of how to opt-out of interest-based advertising from us can be found at:

V. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Your personal information may be collected, transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located, including the United States and other countries where we or our group companies or service providers (among others) maintain facilities. Our group affiliates and our third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. We maintain primary data centers in the United States, Singapore, Japan and Germany.

We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Privacy Policy and according to applicable law.
We have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, including by entering into the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal information, or where required, we will ask you for your prior written consent for such international data transfers.
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland which have been formally recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” and “adequacy regulations” from the European Commission, Swiss and UK authorities.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision, we take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. These safeguards include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021 under Article 46(2) GDPR for transfers originating in the EEA, UK and Switzerland; and the UK Addendum under Article 46(2) of the UK GDPR for the transfer of data originating in the UK.

VI. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHO WE SHARE IT WITH
We do not sell your personal information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we do share your personal information with third parties as described below. If you have consented to us sharing your personal information but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.
Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You will be able to recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is necessary and related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies. This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information that we collect through the Site and Services. If you have any questions about these practices, please contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
Service Providers
We employ third party companies and people, for example cloud service providers (“Third Party Service Providers”), such as Amazon Web Services, Dropbox, Salesforce and
Unity Technologies
to perform tasks e.g., provide computer and network infrastructure services on our behalf or as advertising exchange partners and we may need to share your information with them to provide products or Services to you. We only share your personal information with Third Party Service Providers to the extent necessary for them to assist us and they do not have any right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We may also work with Google to deliver the best advertising opportunities to its clients through the use of remarketing tags. Traffic Clients and other data subjects can consult Google’s policies to learn more about Google’s processing policies
here
.
Third Party Digital Advertising Partners
If you are a Targeted End User, we will share data about you with Partners, to be used by those Partners for advertising-related purposes, including establishing (on behalf of advertisers) whether to bid on the opportunity to show you ads. When we share data in this manner, we will also share with the relevant Partner details about whether you have consented to, or objected to, the use of your data by the Partner for specified purposes.
Group Companies
We may provide your personal information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf to provide the Site and the Services to you. These parties are required to process such information based on our instructions and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. They do not have any independent right to share this information.
Compliance with laws and legal proceedings
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
Merger or Acquisition
If Liftoff Mobile, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.

The security of your personal information is important to us.  Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us
We take appropriate steps to pseudonymize your personal information. For Targeted End Users, the advertising device IDs (which are the only per-user identifiers that we track, and can be reset by the user at any time) are SHA1-hashed before insertion. Since SHA1 is a one-way hashing algorithm, the original raw advertising device ID cannot be reverse-engineered from the hashed version.

If you have provided us with personal information for the purposes of holding an account with us, we will retain your information (including personal information) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.
If we hold information about you through any other means we shall only process this information for as long as is necessary for the purpose and in any event for no longer than 28 days.
Information relating to Targeted End Users is retained for 30 days in pseudonymized form before it is automatically deleted from our active database. Backups are stored indefinitely.
We will delete it after the timescales stated above, except we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
IX. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
We perform the following automated decision-making processes using your personal information:
To build lookalike targeting models to target users who are similar to the Customer’s existing users. Our Machine Learning does this automatically for every Customer. The more upfront device IDs Liftoff has, the more beneficial this is.
For power predictive ML features e.g. users who have purchased in the past are much more likely to purchase again in the future
To exclude existing users from User Acquisition campaigns, and power targeting rules for re-engagement campaigns e.g. target users who have registered but not purchased.
We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal data is subject to automated decision-making. Our technical and organizational security measures can be provided on request.
When we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contacting us using the contact details provided under Section IV titled “Complaints, Questions and Suggestions”.

We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly, and in a  transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.
These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where:
it's necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a  party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a  contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);
it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your  data protection interests), such as for research and development, to  market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and  interests;
you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or
we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation
Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).
We don't keep personal information for longer than is necessary.  While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
                                                 That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
Your data will be processed in accordance with the following legal provisions:
In relation to data submitted in forms, surveys, etc. with your consent, Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR
With regard to the services that you use to fulfill the contract, Article 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR applies

                                                manner that is incompatible with these purposes:

to enable you to access and use our website, associated applications, and associated social media platforms;
to contact and communicate with you;
for internal record-keeping and administrative purposes;
for  analytics, market research, and business development, including operating and improve our website, associated applications, and associated  social media platforms;

Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
If you are situated in China, please be aware that your personal information will be processed in countries outside of China, such as the USA and EU. This processing may occur due to our affiliates who have entrusted us with the distribution of their surveys or the presence of other Company affiliates, agents, or contractors in these regions.

We adopt this notice to comply with the Brazilian Data Protection Law Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (Law No. 13,709/2018) (“LGPD”). Any terms defined in the LGPD have the same meaning when used in this notice.
LGPD
On September 18, 2020, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) came into effect for Brazilian residents. In addition to the rights outlined in our Privacy Policy, as a user located in Brazil, you may be able to exercise the following rights with respect to the personal information that we have collected, subject to certain limitations:

You have the right to access the personal data we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with, including information about any public and private entities we have shared your personal data with.

If you want to correct or revise any of the data we retain on you, you may do so by accessing your account and the information contained within it or contacting our team.
The right to anonymize, block or delete unnecessary or excessive data or data that is not being processed in compliance with the LGPD.
Please note that, depending on the request, this may result in a suspension or discontinuation of certain services and may be governed by legal and/or contractual retention guidelines.
The right to the portability of data to another service or product provider, by means of an express request.
We provide you with the ability to move any of your account data to a third party, at any time.

For example, we may not be able to fully comply with your request if we are bound by certain legal restrictions or contractual requirements, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision.
Exercising Data Portability and Deletion Rights
To exercise the data portability and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us: privacy@makeopinion.com
We will need to verify your identity before processing your request. The verifiable consumer request must:

Our details
We are TheoremReach Inc. TheoremReach is a market research and surveying company that works with companies such as advertisers and market researchers to survey people on their opinions and preferences. Our registered office address is at TheoremReach, 500 Westover Dr. #33399, Sanford, NC 27330.
For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR” or “data protection law”) in respect to personal information of users of the Services, we are the data controller. This is because we dictate the purpose for which your personal information is used and how we use your personal information. We fairly process your information under relevant law. If you have any questions about how your data is kept or if you wish to exercise one or more of your rights in regard to the data we keep on you, please contact our Data Protection Officer at TheoremReach Inc., Attn: Mel Montano, TheoremReach, 500 Westover Dr. #33399, Sanford, NC 27330 or at privacy@theoremreach.com.
For the purposes of data protection law, in respect of personal information of persons who are contacts of our clients (e.g., market researchers and developers), we shall process personal information as a data processor on behalf of our clients, who use our Services to conduct market research surveys. If you are a contact of one of our clients, our client’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy, will apply to our processing of your personal information.
As described in the section below entitled “How is my information shared?”, we may share your personal information with other organizations, such as our customers, that may receive and process your personal information as a controller in their own right.
What information do we collect and how is it collected?
We may collect different types of information depending on your use of the Website and/or our Services. We’ve outlined these practices based on whether you are a website visitor, a market researcher, a developer or a survey respondent.
Website Users
We may collect personal information from you, including your name and email address, when you submit a message to us via our “Contact Us” online form. We may use this information to respond to you or to send you offers (e.g., an offer to take a survey on a different device).
We may also collect personal information about you that you choose to provide to us when you submit a CV, including your name, address, phone number, email address, previous employment, educational background, a list of references, and any other information you choose to provide when you submit your CV to our recruitment team.

Researchers and Developers
We collect registration information about you. In order to use our Services you have to register and create and account providing your email and password.
Your registration information is kept securely and not disclosed to any third party for any other reason than the ones specified hereunder (see “How is my information shared?” section below). We may use your registration information for contacting you occasionally (e.g., for platform announcements, account, activation).
We may work with third-party service providers to provide maintenance services, data analysis, service hosting, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process your registration information, including personal information, as part of providing their contracted services to us. We require these third-party service providers to agree to only use the information we provide them for the purpose for which it was provided.
TheoremReach does not collect or store payment information or other information submitted as part of your payment for the Services. If you are a developer, we only collect your PayPal email address if you use our Services in your apps and/or games. Payment information is collected and processed by our third-party payment provider, PayPal.
Survey Respondents
Generally, we collect the responses that you submit to our multiple choice surveys on behalf of our customers. In certain instances, we may ask if you want to provide your contact information (i.e., email address and/or mobile phone number) for additional follow-up or so you can log in to our Services from multiple devices.
TheoremReach maintains this information in a database, and may use this information to invite you to participate in future survey. Your decision to participate in future surveys is completely at your discretion. That is, you have no obligation to complete this or any future survey. For more information on how to change your preferences, see “What are my options?” section below.
We collect information about you—the individuals who participate in, or are invited to participate in and/or respond to, any of our surveys (collectively, the “Survey Respondents”)—from and under the direction of our customers and we share that information with our customers. If you are a Survey Respondent and have any questions or concerns regarding our customers’ privacy practices, or if you seek access to or wish to correct, amend or delete information, you should contact the entity from whom you received a survey.
The types of personal information we may collect via our surveys include your name, IP address, email address, zip code, address, phone number, demographic information (age, household income, family size, highest education completed), product preferences and any other information you choose to provide. In some cases, health information, information regarding race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, membership information, and gender may also be collected.
We may also collect usage information and device data. For more information about our practices, see the “Use of cookies and device IDs” section below.
We may also use aggregate personal information and statistics for the purposes set forth in the “Can you access your responses?” section below.
How will we use your information and on what legal bases do we use personal information?
In general, we use your personal information to accomplish our business and commercial purposes, including for marketing, transactional purposes, or to otherwise enhance our business practices and our services to you. More specifically, we may use your personal information:
To provide the website to you (including to process registration with the Website). This is in our legitimate interest (i.e., the provision of the Website to you).
To provide you with the services we offer (including to process and deliver surveys, survey responses and rewards, to process, analyze and develop survey data for use with the Services and our customers). This is to perform a contract between you and us.
To communicate with you and other individuals and to carry out your requests and respond to your communications. This is to perform a contract between you and us.

To provide you with information about the Services we offer in accordance with your preferences as indicated (this may include sending you other surveys or information about products or services of a promotional partner on that partner’s behalf), including any marketing consent preferences. We can do this based on your consent.
To comply with any legal or regulatory obligations (including in connection with a court order and establishing, exercising or defending legal claims). This is in our legitimate interests (i.e., protection of our business, employees and customers) and for compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject.
To enforce or apply the agreements concerning you (including agreements between you and us). This is in our legitimate interest (i.e., protection of our business, employees and customers).
We may request your consent in circumstances where a legal justification over and above legitimate interests is required by applicable law (e.g., in relation to our use of certain cookies).
How is my information shared?
The information we collect via surveys is typically used in aggregate form to help companies (our customers) understand marketplace needs as well as to create and deliver better products and services.
We analyze and aggregate your responses to find insights and trends in groups of responses, for advertisers, market researchers, and polling parties, such as for election estimates or product preferences.
We may share the survey responses and response metadata (collectively, the “Response Data”) and related information with survey developers and researchers (i.e., our customers). We may aggregate your Response Data with Response Data collected from other users through the Services and share such aggregated data with third parties, including our advisors, investors, and/or customers. Additionally, we may share Response Data we collect with third parties in connection with the use and operation of the Services and other aspects of our business (e.g., with our customers, agents, advisors, consultants, advertisers, business partners, investors and/or vendors).
When you supply any personal information, such as an email address or phone number, during the course of completing a survey it may be shared with a third-party company who has been hired by us to provide services to help us with our business activities such as product fulfillment, hosting, and follow-up information. For example, we use Amazon Web Services as our cloud service provider for data storage. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose such information.
We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of assets, reorganization or liquidation of our business.
We also reserve the right to disclose your information, including personal information, as we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; to protect TheoremReach and others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Services and our other property; to correct technical problems and malfunctions on the Services; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or other persons or entities. We may disclose your information, if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity or other legal process.

Use of cookies and device IDs
If you are a Survey Respondent, to invite you to participate in surveys that may be of great interest to you and to enable you to use our Services, we use a hashed version of your device ID — a unique identifier of your mobile device that is coded and anonymized. In some cases, when you take our surveys from a mobile browser, we will place “cookies” on your mobile device. Cookies are small text files that your browser stores on your device and are commonly used by web sites to provide you with an enhanced experience by remembering you from previous visits. Our cookies do not contain any personal information, but they enable us to understand the surveys you may have taken. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to inform you or prevent the use of cookies. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able, depending upon the individual survey, to complete more than the first set of questions in a survey.
If you would like to opt-out from either storing your device ID or accepting our cookies, or if you would like to opt out of both of these enhancements, click
privacy@thereomreach.com
and provide your device ID to be removed from the Service.
Log files
Like most online and mobile companies, we log the use of our Services. This includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks in order to administer the survey, track aggregate movement, analyze trends, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to personal information. We collect this from any website user, including market researchers, developers and survey respondents.
Third party links, Applications, and Websites
Our Services may be offered through or in connection with third party mobile applications or third party websites. When you participate in the Services you are leaving the third party mobile application or website through which you accessed the Services. In addition, the Website may contain links to third party websites that are not controlled by us. These links are made available to you as a convenience, and you agree to use these links at your own risk.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage, nor does it apply to your relationship with the third party websites, applications, services, and surveys that may be linked to, facilitated through or provided via our Services. For example, our Services may be made available to you through third party mobile applications (including mobile games). This Privacy Policy only applies to information we collect from you while you are using the Services. If you use a third party application, website, or service or participate in a third party survey, then such third party’s privacy policy will govern the use, storage and disclosure of your information in connection with such site, application, service, or survey. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party websites, applications, services, and surveys nor any data or information you may share with such third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies applicable to each and every third party website, application, service, and survey prior to your access, use, or participation.
Protection of your information; Retention
We take reasonable precautions to protect personal information and to keep personal information secure from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. For example, when you enter information (such as login credentials) on our login form, we encrypt the transmission of that information using transport layer security (TLS). Although we use reasonable efforts to help protect your information, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Website as such information may be transmitted using the Internet, other public telecommunication networks, servers, hardware or software that are not owned, operated, or controlled by us. Any information, including personal information, you provide to us via the Internet is at your own risk. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at
admin@theoremreach.com
.
We will retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for purposes for which it was collected. The precise period will depend on the reason why it was collected. For example: for marketing purposes your personal information will be retained until you withdraw your consent; and in relation to your questions, until your comment or question has been resolved and a reasonable period thereafter or as long as the law requires. Once the retention period for each situation has expired we will take all reasonable steps to destroy or erase from our systems all personal data that we no longer require in accordance with all our applicable record retention schedules and policies.
User feedback
If you provide us with comments, suggestions, recommendations or other feedback pertaining to our Services (collectively, “Feedback”), you understand that we may (although we have no obligation to do so) retain, disclose, use, or otherwise commercially exploit that Feedback in connection with any or all of our Services without compensation or consideration to you.
Where will we transfer your information?
We are headquartered in the United States and we will process your information in the United States. Your personal information will be transferred and stored in the United States.
Due to the global nature of our business, as part of the Services offered to you through our Website, the information which you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Union/European Economic Area (“EU/EEA”) or United Kingdom (“UK”) (such a country is called a “third country”) (e.g., our third-party payment processor in the United States). Data protection law imposes restrictions on the transfer of personal information outside of the EU/EEA or UK but such transfers can be made if the country to which we may transfer the data has an adequate level of protection for your rights, there are appropriate safeguards or a contract is in place allowing the transfer to take place, you have provided your consent or the transfer is necessary for reasons set out in the data protection laws.
If we transfer your information outside of the EU/EEA or UK in this way, we will take reasonable steps and implement appropriate measures to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with data protection law. These measures generally include either transferring personal information to third countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission or transferring personal information to a third country where the recipient has agreed to a European Commission-approved data transfer agreement in the form of standard contractual clauses.

Last Updated: December 4, 2024
Last Edit/ Review: July 3, 2024
1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
These
FAQs
provide a handy entry point to our longer and more comprehensive Privacy Policy (below). They enhance rather than replace the important notices in this Privacy Policy, which governs our collection, use, storage, and sharing of the information that we collect or receive from you.
What’s new as of December 4, 2024?
On December 4, 2024, we updated our position with LevelPlay from a “Data Processor” to a “Data Controller”. We also made some formatting updates, updated our Third Party Partners list.
The difference between an edit/review and an update is that "updates" involve material changes to our Policy whereas edits are not material or simply indicate a review has occurred. For example, we may make clarifying edits by giving additional examples. When we provide an update, you will receive a notice to accept and read the changes, which are summarized here.

6. Our Policies Concerning Children
Unity Struckd
If the user is a child, we may collect and store the below information solely for our internal operations and our legitimate interest:
IP address
Unique Installation-specific ID
Randomly generated User ID
Vendor ID
Device ID
We collect the above information
for internal analytics to understand the service and e.g., why an error is occuring in Struckd or what causes users to engage with Struckd
so that we can send push notification
so that we can make updates to the application without needing to push an update
We may share some of this information with our service providers who we contract with to help us provide our services to you. Please note, while we collect country and birth date, this information is not stored.
Unity Advertising  Services
Developers using Unity’s Advertising Services may offer any of the following three categories of applications: 1) child-directed (Users are likely children), 2) mixed audience (Users are both children and non-children), 3) non-child directed (Users are unlikely to be children). If the application is a mixed audience, the Developer should implement an age-gate where required by law, and send a signal to Unity which indicates that we need to limit data collection, serve non-personalized ads, or otherwise disable the service. The Developer similarly categorizes applications which are specifically child-directed. A child is considered to be any User under the age of consent in their applicable jurisdiction.
In connection with the Ads Service, in the event we receive a signal from a Developer, we reduce our data collection for our Ads Service. In such instances, we will only collect Personal Information listed below. We collect this Personal Information for internal operations and our legitimate interests in providing the Service.
IP address is used to provide a compliant experience suitable for the User’s region.
Unique Installation-specific ID is used for operational purposes related to the serving of contextual advertisements.
User ID is used in connection with providing rewards in exchange for watching an ad. Unity uses a developer-set identification (User ID) to let the Developer know when a User with the User ID has completed the watched the ad and is therefore entitled to receive the in-game reward (coin, gems, etc.).
In connection with the Unity Rewards service, in the event we receive a signal from a Developer, we will collect and maintain a service-specific identifier associated with the Developer’s application in order to enable a service block since the Unity Rewards service is not intended for children.
Our Services are otherwise not intended for children. If you are aware that our Services are otherwise collecting Personal Information about children, please contact us at
DPO@unity3d.com
If you or your parent or guardian have questions about this policy or how we use your personal information, you can contact us at
DPO@unity3d.com
.

9. Transfers out of Country of Collection
Unity has implemented and maintains a framework consistent with applicable law for transfers of Personal Information outside of the country of collection, including for transfers out of the UK and/or EEA.
Unity has implemented and maintains a framework consistent with applicable law for transfers of Personal Information outside of the country of collection, including for transfers out of the UK and/or EEA.
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have
facilities
, including
ironSource
which is headquartered in Israel, or in which we engage service providers, such as Google Cloud Platform and Looker, and by using the Services you understand that your Personal Information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.
Where this will involve transferring your Personal Information outside the UK and/or EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
Adequacy Decisions:
Some non-EEA countries are recognized under the UK GDPR and by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available
here
). For example, we may transfer to our affiliates who are located around the world, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Standard Contractual Clauses:
For transfers of Personal Information from the UK and/or EEA to third countries, which are not considered adequate under the UK GDPR and/or by the European Commission, we have put in place standard contractual clauses adopted under the UK GDPR and/or by the European Commission to protect your Personal Information. For example, we use Google Cloud Platform’s infrastructure and data centers which are located around the world, including the United States. We rely on both controller-controller and controller-processor Standard Contractual Clauses. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting us in accordance with the “
Contacting Us
” section below. “
UK GDPR
” has the meaning given to it in section 3(10) (as supplemented by section 205(4)) of the Data Protection Act 2018.
Japan
For transfers from Japan to countries other than the EEA/UK, we have put adequate measures in place to protect your Personal Information.
The transferees are obligated to comply with equivalent or comparable rules to those under the Act on the Protection of Personal Information of Japan (APPI) on a continuous basis, and we periodically confirm their compliance. We also periodically confirm any changes to the data privacy regulations of other countries that may affect the compliance measures taken by our overseas affiliates and third-party service providers and take measures such as requesting that they take corrective measures or suspending the provision of Personal Information if any issues arise in the implementation of such compliance measures. We will provide you with further information on the measures we take in this regard upon your request.
10. Retention
We retain Personal Information for as long as is necessary or as permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law, for example, for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. The criteria to determine our retention periods include:
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services);
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
Where a legal obligation arises or retention is advisable in light of our legal position, in some circumstances, we will retain certain Personal Information, even after your account has been deleted and/or we no longer provide the Services to you; for example:
To cooperate with law enforcement or public, regulatory and government authorities: If we receive a preservation order or search warrant, related to your Services account, we will preserve Personal Information subject to such order or warrant after you delete your Services account.
To comply with legal provisions on tax and accounting: We may retain your Personal Information after you delete your Personal Information, as required by tax law and to comply with bookkeeping requirements. Please note the length of time may vary by country.
For fraud and security purposes: We may retain your Personal Information for fraud/ security purposes such as IP address, User ID, Device ID, and unique app installation-specific ID, which can be used to investigate whether a specific device exhibits a pattern of abnormal app interaction behavior, which may indicate a malicious bot or fraudulent actor.
To pursue or defend a legal action: We may retain relevant Personal Information in the event of a legal claim or complaint, including regulatory investigations or legal proceedings about a claim related to your Personal Information, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation (whether in respect of our relationship with you or otherwise) after the dispute has been settled or decided by a court or tribunal from which there is no further right of appeal. The criteria for determining the length of time we will retain this information include:
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, if the settlement or decision requires us to keep the records for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
11. Security
We employ a variety of measures to safeguard the collection, transmission, and storage of the information we collect. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process, and store, and the current state of technology. Please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the
“Contact Us”
section below
12. Biometric Information
Please note, Unity is a data processor for information uploaded through Safe Voice, which, depending on legal interpretation, may be considered biometric data. The following Section contains legal information which is only applicable under U.S. Law.
Your use of certain features may result in the collection of biometric information. Biometric information is any information based on an individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual. Biometric information that may be collected depending on how you use Unity's products includes voice recordings. For example, if you are using Unity Safe Voice for in-app voice communication, that may be considered to be collecting biometric information under applicable laws.
We use commercially reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative methods designed to protect biometric information within our organization.
We retain biometric information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purposes stated in this policy, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by applicable law. For more information on the criteria used to determine our retention periods, please see the "
Retention
" section in our Privacy Policy.
We will destroy or dispose of your biometric information as required by applicable law. For example, we may destroy electronic records of biometric information through such processes as overwriting magnetic media, degaussing, or physical destruction, and we may dispose of paper records by such processes as shredding or incineration.
Please note you may need to make your request for deletion through Unity’s customer as we may need our customer’s assistance to locate your account.
13. Unity Ads Privacy Features and Third Party Partners in Providing Advertising
Privacy Features
If Unity delivers personalized advertising through its ad network, Unity will provide notice and information about how you may be able to opt-out of such personalized advertisements. Please note that the limitations available to you are determined by the laws within your jurisdiction and the tools the Developer chooses to implement. Such an opportunity to opt out may occur through your device settings (see the section “Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices” in our
Cookie & Advertising Policy
and the choices available within the ad unit as described in this Policy by accessing the Data Privacy icon in the ad unit.
Developer Advertising Using Other Ad Networks
Developers may use other third-party advertising networks, and Unity’s choice features within its ad units only apply to ads delivered in the Unity network.
Please note that the Developer of the app showing Unity Ads may have limited choices in providing certain identifying information, including your device advertising ID, about you to our third-party partners advertising goods and services with Unity. You may still see ads from the partners listed below, but they will not be based on your Personal Information. Additionally, you may have opted-out of profiling in Unity’s ad network within a Unity Ad for your app, in which case we will only serve contextual ads from ourselves and these partners within your app. For all others, please review the following information:
Third Party Ad Network Partners
The following third-party partners may receive an ad request from Unity containing your Personal Information. This list may be updated from time to time.

We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information.
In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps or our Social Media Pages.

9 – DATA-SAFETY
The data will be processed by automated means for the time strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which they have been collected and in compliance with the principle of necessity and proportionality, avoiding the processing of personal data if the operations can be performed through the use of anonymous data or by other means.
We have adopted specific security measures to prevent the loss of personal data, illegal or incorrect use and unauthorized access but please note that it is essential for the security of data that the device is equipped with tools such as constantly updated antivirus and that the provider supplying the Internet connection ensures the safe transmission of data through firewalls, anti-spam filters and similar measures.

‍
Revocation Of Consent or Objections.
We will grant, where required by law, your request to revoke consent to processing (where our processing is based upon consent), or object to our processing (where our processing is not based upon your consent).  If you revoke your consent or object we may no longer be able to provide you Services. In some cases we may limit or deny your request to revoke consent or object if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity.
To the extent that we are a data processor that is processing your information on behalf of one of our Clients, we encourage you to reach out to that Client to make your request, as we are required to await instructions from the Client as the data controller. If you submit your request directly to us, we may explain how to forward your request to the applicable Client for handling as the data controller.
To exercise your rights as described in this Notice, you may contact us via the following methods:
Via our Privacy Rights Requests Form found here: https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/e0118af2-14b4-4fff-a224-80889caf13ff

Note that we may require you to prove your identity, including by phone call or email. Depending on your request, we will ask for information such as your name, the last item you received or ordered from us, or the date of your last redemption or order from us. We may also ask you to provide a signed declaration confirming your identity.
In some circumstances, you may designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf.  We will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf.  You must provide us with a copy of the signed permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us.

Additional Information for California Residents and California Notice at Collection
Your California Privacy Rights; “Shine the Light” Law
California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for third parties’ own direct marketing
purposes.
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
‍
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents the rights to receive certain information regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information about them, as well as rights to know/access, correct, delete, and limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information and opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of “personal information” (as all terms in quotes are defined under the CCPA).
Under the CCPA, you have the right to receive notice of certain information about our data collection, use, and disclosure. The following table summarizes the categories of personal information we collect; the categories of sources of that information; whether we disclose, sell, or share that information to service providers or third parties, respectively; and the criteria we use to determine the retention period for such information. The categories we use to describe personal information are those enumerated in the CCPA. We collect this personal information for the purposes described above in “Use and Processing of Information.”
Please note that because this list is comprehensive, it may refer to types of information that we collect and share about people other than yourself. For example, while we transfer credit card or debit card numbers for our business purpose in order to process payments for orders placed with us, we do not collect or transfer credit card or debit card numbers of individuals that submit questions through our website’s “contact us” page.
‍
Categories of Personal Information That We Collect

Government entities, law enforcement, lawyers, auditors, consultants and other parties as required by law
Not sold/shared
We determine the retention period for each of the categories of personal information listed above based on (1) the length of time we need to retain the information to achieve the business or commercial purpose for which it was obtained, (2) any legal or regulatory requirements applicable to such information, (3) internal operational needs, and (4) any need for the information based on any actual or anticipated investigation or litigation.
Entities to whom we disclose information for business purposes are Service Providers, which are companies that we engage to conduct activities on our behalf. We prohibit Service Providers from using personal information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement.
Entities to whom we “sell” or with whom we “share” information are third parties. Under the CCPA, a business “sells” personal information when it discloses personal information to a company for monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party either because we disclose personal information to the company for something other than an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because its contract does not prohibit it from using personal information for purposes unrelated to the service it provides to us. A business “shares” personal information when it discloses personal information to a company for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. Mobile Information received for multi-factor authentication purposes will not be shared with third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.

‍
Opt out of sale or sharing of personal information
: You have the right to opt out of our sale or sharing of your personal information to third parties. To exercise this right, please visit our
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
webpage or contact us. Your right to opt out does not apply to our disclosure of personal information to Service Providers.

‍
