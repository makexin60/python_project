With Business Partners for their own purposes

            may disclose your personal information to them for their own
            purposes or their service providers’, such as for marketing or
            compliance purposes. In many cases, such disclosure is related to
            our operation of the Services, such as disclosing your information
            to a Business Partner when you make a purchase or place a bet
            on-site at or near the stadium of that Business Partner.

            live (See “Your Choices”). However, we do not control
            how Business Partners use and share your information once they
            receive it. You will need to contact such Business Partners directly
            for information about their privacy practices or to exercise rights
            you may have (including if you would like to opt-out of receiving
            future emails from a Business Partner).
With other third parties with your consent
.
Service-Specific Processing of Information
Several of our Services involve specific processing activities, which
          are described below in this section.
Identity Verification and Biometric Information
Some of our Services require verifying your identity by collecting
          your picture (such as a selfie) of you along with a picture or scan of
          your driver’s license or other government-issued identification
          document.  We may engage vendors that use such information to
          capture, scan, obtain, and use your biometric data—specifically,
          your facial geometry scan—to verify your identity and protect
          the safety and security of the Services. FBG does not capture,
          receive, obtain, or otherwise store your biometric information, but
          instead uses a third party service provider.  Depending on your
          state of residence, such service provider may either be Socure or
          IDVerse.  For more information on how our vendor, Socure, uses,
          discloses, destroys, and safeguards your biometric information, and
          the length of time for which Socure stores your biometric information,
          please review the Socure Privacy Statement, available at
socure.com/privacy
.  For further information on how our vendor, IDVerse, uses,
          discloses, destroys, and safeguards your biometric information, and
          the length of time for which IDVerse stores your biometric
          information, please review the IDVerse Privacy Policy, available at
https://idverse.com/privacy-policy/
.  If you have questions, please contact us at the information
          below or reach out to the vendor directly regarding their treatment of
          biometric information.  Please note that if you choose not to
          provide your biometric information, you may not be able to use the
          Services.
If you choose to use facial or fingerprint scans to access your
          account through our mobile application, please see your device
          provider’s policies for information regarding collection, use,
          retention and storage of such information.
Betting and Gaming (Including Casino)
You must provide certain information to use our betting and gaming
          Services. This information may include:
Name and address;
Phone Number;
Age;
Geolocation, including precise geolocation information;
A scan or other image of driver’s license or other ID
            card;
Social Security number;
Information about your sportsbook transactions, including the time,
            amount wagered, event wagered on, and results; and
If available, information about your casino transactions, including
            the games played, time, amount wagered, and results.
Some of this information, including precise geolocation, biometric
          information, Social Security number, and images of ID cards, is
          sensitive personal information.
In addition to the purposes described in the How We Use Your Personal
          Information section above, we gather this information to verify your
          identity and that you are located in a state that permits betting and
          gaming Services, as well as for tax, payment, reporting, and related
          obligations. We may also use your information to record your results,
          notify you about events or games you may have an interest in, inform
          you about promotions, collect fees, and receive and process disputes.
You will not be able to use betting and gaming services without
          location data being turned on.  Where we collect precise
          geolocation data to enable betting and gaming Services, we will use
          that data to verify your eligibility to place bets or wagers, process
          payments, perform analytics, and for purposes of legal and regulatory
          compliance.
Streaming
In connection with our streaming offering, we may disclose your
          Personal Information to partners and content licensors, like the NFL,
          Genius, and Sportsradar, who may be involved in providing video
          content that you may access through the Services.
As required by law or otherwise as directed by you.
We may also disclose any Personal Information, including sensitive
          personal information as required by gaming regulators and oversight
          agencies or boards (including integrity monitoring associations) who
          have the lawful right to seek such information in connection with
          regulating us and our business practices under applicable state law or
          regulations.
If you, to the extent permitted by applicable law, give third parties
          access to credentials for your betting and gaming account for purposes
          of account aggregation and analysis, you are authorizing them to
          access any information available to you in your account, and therefore
          directing us to make that data available to them. Do not provide third
          parties with credentials to your account if you do not intend to
          authorize such access, or if such provision of credentials is not
          permitted by applicable law.

Cookies and Similar Technologies
Our Properties (and authorized third parties) use cookies and similar
          technologies to collect information about you, your device, and how
          you interact with our Properties. This section contains additional
          information about:
The types of technologies we use and the purposes for which we use
            them
The types of information we collect using these technologies
How we disclose or make information available to others
Choices you may have regarding these technologies
Types of Cookies and Similar Technologies We Use
Our Properties and the third parties that we authorize may use the
          following technologies:
Cookies
, which are a type of technology that install a small amount of
            information on a user's computer or other device when they visit
            a website. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some
            are persistent over multiple sessions over time.
Pixels, web beacons, and tags
, which are types of code or transparent graphics that contain a
            unique identifier. In addition to the uses described below, these
            technologies provide analytical information about the user
            experience and help us customize our marketing activities. In
            contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard
            drive, pixels, web beacons, and tags are embedded invisibly on web
            pages and other digital properties, such as emails.
Session replay tools
, which record your interactions with our Properties, such as how
            you move throughout our Properties and engage with our webforms. In
            addition to the uses described below, this information helps us
            improve our Properties and identify and fix technical issues
            visitors may be having with our Properties.
Embedded scripts and SDKs
, which allow us to build and integrate custom apps and
            experiences, some of which may be developed by a third party.
Purposes for Using These Technologies
We and authorized third parties use these technologies for those
          purposes described in this Privacy Notice, which may include:
Personalization, such as remembering user preferences, login
            details and browsing behavior; tracking your activity across online
            properties and platforms over time to better understand your
            preferences and interests; and personalizing online content;
Improving performance, such as maintaining and improving the
            performance of our Properties and Services;
Analytics, such as analyzing how our websites are used. For
            example, we may use Google Analytics to help us improve our
            Properties, performance and user experiences.  Google Analytics
            may use cookies and tracking technologies to perform their
            services.  To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes
            data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our
            partners’ sites or apps” located at
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners
; and
Advertising, such as providing you with offers that may be of
            interest to you; conducting targeted advertising to you on our
            Properties and those of third parties; and measuring the
            effectiveness of our communications with you and advertising
            campaigns, including identifying how and when you engage with our
            communications.
Information Collected
These technologies collect data about you and your device, such as
          your IP address, location (both approximate and precise), cookie ID,
          device ID, AdID, operating system, browser used, browser history,
          search history, and information about how you interact with our
          Properties (such as pages on our Properties that you have
          viewed).
Disclosures of Your Information
We may disclose information to third parties or allow third parties
          to directly collect information using these technologies on our
          Properties, such as social media companies, advertising networks,
          companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting,
          security providers, and others that help us operate our business and
          Properties.
Tracking Technologies
Like many other websites and applications, we may automatically
          collect certain information regarding our Services' users. Such
          information may include, without limitation, the IP address (which may
          be used to determine your geographic location) of your
          computer/internet service provider, your device ID, your zip code, the
          date and time you access the Services, the Internet address of a
          referring website, the operating system you are using, the sections or
          pages of the Services that you visit, and the images and content
          viewed.  We collect information using tools such as cookies,
          web beacons, pixels, tags, embedded scripts, session replay tools,
          SDKs, and tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking
          Technologies”), some of which are further described below.
You can refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings. If
          you refuse or delete cookies, some of our Properties’
          functionality may be impaired. Please refer to your browser’s
          Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the
          use of tracking technologies. If you change computers, devices,
          or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or browsers; or delete
          your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer,
          device, or browser. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not
          opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based
          advertising from us or our agents or representatives.
Interest-Based Advertising
We may use information we collect (alone or in combination with
          information provided by third parties and service providers) to
          deliver targeted advertising (about us or other third party products
          and services) to you when you interact with our Services or other
          websites. Information about you (such as email address) as well as
          cookies and similar technologies (described above) may be used in this
          process. For example, if you are searching for information on a
          particular team in connection with a purchase or wager, we may use
          that information to cause an advertisement to appear on other websites
          you view. We may, now or in the future, have the ability to engage in
          “cross-device matching” to display targeted advertisements
          to you across browsers and devices (as described in Section 6
          above).
To further clarify, we partner with third parties that collect
          information across various channels, including offline and online, for
          purposes of delivering more relevant advertising to you or your
          business. Our partners may place or recognize a cookie on your
          computer, device, or directly in our emails/communications, and we may
          disclose personal information to them if you have submitted such
          information to us, such as your name, postal address, email address,
          or device ID. Our partners use this information to recognize you
          across different channels and platforms, including but not limited to,
          computers, mobile devices, and smart TVs, over time for advertising,
          analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.
If you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements
          please see the Your Choices section below.
Data Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
          fulfill the purposes we have outlined above unless we are required to
          do otherwise by applicable law. This includes, for example, retaining
          your personal information to provide you with the products or services
          you have requested and interact with you; maintain our business
          relationship with you; improve our business over time; ensure the
          ongoing legality, safety and security of our Services and
          relationships; or otherwise in accordance with our internal retention
          procedures.
Third-Party Websites and Social Media Services
Third-Party Websites
. The Services may contain links to other websites or Internet
            resources. When you click on one of those links, you are contacting
            another website or Internet resource. We have no responsibility or
            liability for, or control over, those other websites or resources or
            their collection, use and disclosure of your information, and this
            Privacy Notice does not apply to personal information collected
            through those websites or resources. We suggest that you read the
            privacy policy and terms of use of each such website.
Social Media, Widgets and Open Forums
. Our Services may allow you to engage with social media
            services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram
            ("Social Networks"), and widgets such as the "Share
            this" button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our
            Services or which link from Social Networks to our Services
            ("Social Functions"). These Social Functions may access,
            collect, and integrate with your Social Network accounts and
            information. For example, these Social Functions may collect your IP
            address, identify which page you are visiting on our Services, or
            set a cookie. Social Functions may also be used to register you as a
            Services user. For example, if you are not currently registered as a
            Website user and you use certain Social Functions, you will be asked
            to enter your Social Network credentials and then be given the
            option to register and join the Website. If you choose to use these
            Social Functions, you may be sharing certain Social Network profile
            elements with us, including your name, birthday (month/day),
            comments, contacts, email address, photos, or favorite teams. This
            sharing is subject to each Social Network's own privacy policy
            and terms of use. We do not control those Social Networks or your
            profiles on those services. Nor do we modify your privacy settings
            on those services or establish rules about how your personal
            information on those services will be used. Social Functions are
            either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services.
            Your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy of
            the company providing them. Please refer to the privacy settings in
            your Social Network account to manage the data that is shared with
            us through your account. Information you include and transmit online
            in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, or Social Network, or that
            you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel or survey, may
            be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We do not
            control such uses of your personal information, and by using such
            services you assume the risk and acknowledge that the personal
            information provided by you may be viewed and used by us and/or
            third parties for any number of purposes and that the usage
            restrictions set forth in this Privacy Notice do not apply to such
            services. To request removal of your personal information from a
            blog, community forum or other publicly accessible part of the
            Services, contact us
using the information in the Contact Us section
. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal
            information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to
            do so.
Your Choices
We strive to offer you choices about how information is used and
          disclosed. There are several ways in which you may opt out of the
          various programs and services we provide. Some of the ways in which
          you may opt out are described below. Additional disclosures under U.S.

Push Notifications
. We also may enable our mobile application to offer automatic (or
            “push”) notifications.  We will provide push
            notifications only to those users who permit such notifications.
             If you would like to opt-out of push notifications, you can do
            so using your mobile device settings.

            the specific personal information we maintain about you, (ii) a copy
            of the categories of information we collect about you, (iii) correct
            your personal information, or (iv) delete certain of your personal
            information. You may submit such requests by emailing your request
            to
the email address in the Contact Us section.  We will respond
            to

            rights that may be available to you.
Business Partner Opt-Out
. If you do not want your personal information disclosed to
            any third party who may use such information for direct marketing
            purposes, then you may opt-out of such future disclosures by sending
            an email to
the email address in the Contact Us section
. However, we are not responsible for removing your personal
            information from the lists of any third party who has previously
            been provided with your information in accordance with this Privacy
            Notice, and any elections or privacy choices you may make with
            respect to receipt of certain types of e-mails or marketing
            communications from us will not apply to any such third parties. You
            should directly contact any third parties that send you
            communications with respect to choices that they may make available
            to you with respect to such communications.
Do Not Track Signals
.
Do Not Track (“DNT”)
is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
            browsers.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the
            information
collected on our websites for third-party purposes, and that
            is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms described in
            this Privacy Notice. Some web browsers offer users a “Do Not
            Track” privacy preference setting in the web browser. Due to
            technical limitations, the Services do not currently respond to or
            honor browser-initiated Do Not Track signals. Learn more
            about
Do Not Track
.
Interest-Based Advertising
. To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience,
            we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize
            the content on the website and on other websites. Some of these
            third parties may participate in Digital Advertising Alliance
            ("DAA") and Network Advertising Initiative
            ("NAI") programs, which provide mechanisms for you to opt
            out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members
            at www.aboutads.info and optout.networkadvertising.org. Opting out
            of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all
            advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or
            our agents or representatives.
Location Data Opt-Out.
In some cases, you may also adjust the settings on your
            personal device or mobile device to allow or restrict the sharing of
            location information. For example, the "location"
            permissions on your personal device or mobile device may allow you
            to elect whether to never share location information with us, to
            share location information only while you are using the Services or
            always share location information even if you are not using the
            Services. If you elect to not share your location information, you
            may be unable to access certain features of our Services related to
            wagering. Also, in the event that you prevent the sharing of
            location information, we may still estimate your general location
            based on the IP address you use to access Services other than those
            that enable wagering.
Security of Your Personal Information
We use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of
          the personal information submitted to us both during transmission and
          after we receive it.
Children’s Privacy
We are committed to the preservation of online privacy for all of our
          visitors, including children. We sell products and provide services
          intended for purchase by adults (i.e., those 21 and older and of
          lawful betting age). If you engage with our Services, you are
          representing that you are an adult lawfully permitted to engage with
          our Services. We will not knowingly collect any personal information
          from minors or those under the age of 21 without the consent of that
          child's parent or guardian. If you are under the age of 21, you
          are not authorized to use the Services. If we become aware that
          personal information from an individual under age 21 has been
          collected, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such
          information from our database. To notify us if you believe that we
          have information for an individual under 21 or a minor without
          parental consent, please contact us
using the information in the Contact Us section
.

With Business Partners for their own purposes
: We work with third parties (“Business Partners”) and
            may disclose your personal information to them for their own
            purposes or their service providers’, such as for marketing or
            compliance purposes. In many cases, such disclosure is related to

            to a Business Partner when you make a purchase or place a bet
            on-site at or near the stadium of that Business Partner.

            live (See “Your Choices”). However, we do not control
            how Business Partners use and share your information once they
            receive it. You will need to contact such Business Partners directly
            for information about their privacy practices or to exercise rights
            you may have (including if you would like to opt-out of receiving
            future emails from a Business Partner).
With other third parties with your consent

Service-Specific Processing of Information
Several of our Services involve specific processing activities, which
          are described below in this section.
Identity Verification and Biometric Information
Some of our Services require verifying your identity by collecting
          your picture (such as a selfie) of you along with a picture or scan of
          your driver’s license or other government-issued identification
          document.  We may engage vendors that use such information to
          capture, scan, obtain, and use your biometric data—specifically,
          your facial geometry scan—to verify your identity and protect
          the safety and security of the Services. FBG does not capture,
          receive, obtain, or otherwise store your biometric information, but
          instead uses a third party service provider.  Depending on your
          state of residence, such service provider may either be Socure or
          IDVerse.  For more information on how our vendor, Socure, uses,
          discloses, destroys, and safeguards your biometric information, and
          the length of time for which Socure stores your biometric information,
          please review the Socure Privacy Statement, available at
socure.com/privacy
.  For further information on how our vendor, IDVerse, uses,
          discloses, destroys, and safeguards your biometric information, and
          the length of time for which IDVerse stores your biometric
          information, please review the IDVerse Privacy Policy, available at
https://idverse.com/privacy-policy/
.  If you have questions, please contact us at the information
          below or reach out to the vendor directly regarding their treatment of
          biometric information.  Please note that if you choose not to
          provide your biometric information, you may not be able to use the
          Services.
If you choose to use facial or fingerprint scans to access your
          account through our mobile application, please see your device
          provider’s policies for information regarding collection, use,
          retention and storage of such information.
Betting and Gaming (Including Casino)
You must provide certain information to use our betting and gaming
          Services. This information may include:
Name and address;
Phone Number;

A scan or other image of driver’s license or other ID
            card;
Social Security number;
Information about your sportsbook transactions, including the time,
            amount wagered, event wagered on, and results; and

            the games played, time, amount wagered, and results.
Some of this information, including precise geolocation, biometric
          information, Social Security number, and images of ID cards, is
          sensitive personal information.
In addition to the purposes described in the How We Use Your Personal
          Information section above, we gather this information to verify your
          identity and that you are located in a state that permits betting and
          gaming Services, as well as for tax, payment, reporting, and related
          obligations. We may also use your information to record your results,
          notify you about events or games you may have an interest in, inform
          you about promotions, collect fees, and receive and process disputes.
You will not be able to use betting and gaming services without
          location data being turned on.  Where we collect precise
          geolocation data to enable betting and gaming Services, we will use
          that data to verify your eligibility to place bets or wagers, process
          payments, perform analytics, and for purposes of legal and regulatory
          compliance.
Streaming
In connection with our streaming offering, we may disclose your
          Personal Information to partners and content licensors, like the NFL,
          Genius, and Sportsradar, who may be involved in providing video

As required by law or otherwise as directed by you.
We may also disclose any Personal Information, including sensitive
          personal information as required by gaming regulators and oversight
          agencies or boards (including integrity monitoring associations) who
          have the lawful right to seek such information in connection with
          regulating us and our business practices under applicable state law or
          regulations.
If you, to the extent permitted by applicable law, give third parties
          access to credentials for your betting and gaming account for purposes
          of account aggregation and analysis, you are authorizing them to
          access any information available to you in your account, and therefore
          directing us to make that data available to them. Do not provide third
          parties with credentials to your account if you do not intend to
          authorize such access, or if such provision of credentials is not
          permitted by applicable law.

The types of information we collect using these technologies

Cookies
, which are a type of technology that install a small amount of
            information on a user's computer or other device when they visit
            a website. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some

            technologies provide analytical information about the user
            experience and help us customize our marketing activities. In
            contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard
            drive, pixels, web beacons, and tags are embedded invisibly on web
            pages and other digital properties, such as emails.
Session replay tools
, which record your interactions with our Properties, such as how
            you move throughout our Properties and engage with our webforms. In
            addition to the uses described below, this information helps us
            improve our Properties and identify and fix technical issues
            visitors may be having with our Properties.
Embedded scripts and SDKs
, which allow us to build and integrate custom apps and
            experiences, some of which may be developed by a third party.
Purposes for Using These Technologies
We and authorized third parties use these technologies for those
          purposes described in this Privacy Notice, which may include:
Personalization, such as remembering user preferences, login
            details and browsing behavior; tracking your activity across online
            properties and platforms over time to better understand your
            preferences and interests; and personalizing online content;
Improving performance, such as maintaining and improving the
            performance of our Properties and Services;
Analytics, such as analyzing how our websites are used. For
            example, we may use Google Analytics to help us improve our
            Properties, performance and user experiences.  Google Analytics
            may use cookies and tracking technologies to perform their
            services.  To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes
            data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our
            partners’ sites or apps” located at
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners
; and
Advertising, such as providing you with offers that may be of
            interest to you; conducting targeted advertising to you on our
            Properties and those of third parties; and measuring the
            effectiveness of our communications with you and advertising
            campaigns, including identifying how and when you engage with our
            communications.
Information Collected
These technologies collect data about you and your device, such as
          your IP address, location (both approximate and precise), cookie ID,
          device ID, AdID, operating system, browser used, browser history,
          search history, and information about how you interact with our
          Properties (such as pages on our Properties that you have
          viewed).
Disclosures of Your Information
We may disclose information to third parties or allow third parties
          to directly collect information using these technologies on our
          Properties, such as social media companies, advertising networks,
          companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting,
          security providers, and others that help us operate our business and
          Properties.
Tracking Technologies
Like many other websites and applications, we may automatically
          collect certain information regarding our Services' users. Such
          information may include, without limitation, the IP address (which may
          be used to determine your geographic location) of your
          computer/internet service provider, your device ID, your zip code, the
          date and time you access the Services, the Internet address of a
          referring website, the operating system you are using, the sections or
          pages of the Services that you visit, and the images and content
          viewed.  We collect information using tools such as cookies,
          web beacons, pixels, tags, embedded scripts, session replay tools,
          SDKs, and tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking
          Technologies”), some of which are further described below.
You can refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings. If
          you refuse or delete cookies, some of our Properties’
          functionality may be impaired. Please refer to your browser’s
          Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the
          use of tracking technologies. If you change computers, devices,
          or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or browsers; or delete
          your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer,
          device, or browser. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not
          opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based
          advertising from us or our agents or representatives.
Interest-Based Advertising
We may use information we collect (alone or in combination with
          information provided by third parties and service providers) to
          deliver targeted advertising (about us or other third party products
          and services) to you when you interact with our Services or other
          websites. Information about you (such as email address) as well as
          cookies and similar technologies (described above) may be used in this
          process. For example, if you are searching for information on a
          particular team in connection with a purchase or wager, we may use
          that information to cause an advertisement to appear on other websites
          you view. We may, now or in the future, have the ability to engage in
          “cross-device matching” to display targeted advertisements
          to you across browsers and devices (as described in Section 6
          above).
To further clarify, we partner with third parties that collect

          disclose personal information to them if you have submitted such

Data Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
          fulfill the purposes we have outlined above unless we are required to
          do otherwise by applicable law. This includes, for example, retaining
          your personal information to provide you with the products or services
          you have requested and interact with you; maintain our business
          relationship with you; improve our business over time; ensure the
          ongoing legality, safety and security of our Services and
          relationships; or otherwise in accordance with our internal retention
          procedures.
Third-Party Websites and Social Media Services
Third-Party Websites
. The Services may contain links to other websites or Internet
            resources. When you click on one of those links, you are contacting
            another website or Internet resource. We have no responsibility or
            liability for, or control over, those other websites or resources or
            their collection, use and disclosure of your information, and this
            Privacy Notice does not apply to personal information collected
            through those websites or resources. We suggest that you read the
            privacy policy and terms of use of each such website.
Social Media, Widgets and Open Forums
. Our Services may allow you to engage with social media
            services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram
            ("Social Networks"), and widgets such as the "Share
            this" button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our
            Services or which link from Social Networks to our Services
            ("Social Functions"). These Social Functions may access,
            collect, and integrate with your Social Network accounts and
            information. For example, these Social Functions may collect your IP
            address, identify which page you are visiting on our Services, or
            set a cookie. Social Functions may also be used to register you as a
            Services user. For example, if you are not currently registered as a
            Website user and you use certain Social Functions, you will be asked
            to enter your Social Network credentials and then be given the
            option to register and join the Website. If you choose to use these
            Social Functions, you may be sharing certain Social Network profile
            elements with us, including your name, birthday (month/day),
            comments, contacts, email address, photos, or favorite teams. This
            sharing is subject to each Social Network's own privacy policy
            and terms of use. We do not control those Social Networks or your
            profiles on those services. Nor do we modify your privacy settings
            on those services or establish rules about how your personal
            information on those services will be used. Social Functions are
            either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services.
            Your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy of
            the company providing them. Please refer to the privacy settings in
            your Social Network account to manage the data that is shared with
            us through your account. Information you include and transmit online
            in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, or Social Network, or that
            you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel or survey, may
            be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We do not
            control such uses of your personal information, and by using such
            services you assume the risk and acknowledge that the personal
            information provided by you may be viewed and used by us and/or
            third parties for any number of purposes and that the usage
            restrictions set forth in this Privacy Notice do not apply to such
            services. To request removal of your personal information from a
            blog, community forum or other publicly accessible part of the
            Services, contact us
using the information in the Contact Us section
. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal
            information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to
            do so.
Your Choices
We strive to offer you choices about how information is used and

. We also may enable our mobile application to offer automatic (or
            “push”) notifications.  We will provide push

            so using your mobile device settings.

            rights that may be available to you.
Business Partner Opt-Out
. If you do not want your personal information disclosed to
            any third party who may use such information for direct marketing
            purposes, then you may opt-out of such future disclosures by sending
            an email to
the email address in the Contact Us section

            information from the lists of any third party who has previously
            been provided with your information in accordance with this Privacy
            Notice, and any elections or privacy choices you may make with
            respect to receipt of certain types of e-mails or marketing
            communications from us will not apply to any such third parties. You
            should directly contact any third parties that send you
            communications with respect to choices that they may make available
            to you with respect to such communications.
Do Not Track Signals
.
Do Not Track (“DNT”)
is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
            browsers.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the
            information
collected on our websites for third-party purposes, and that
            is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms described in
            this Privacy Notice. Some web browsers offer users a “Do Not
            Track” privacy preference setting in the web browser. Due to
            technical limitations, the Services do not currently respond to or
            honor browser-initiated Do Not Track signals. Learn more
            about
Do Not Track
.
Interest-Based Advertising
. To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience,
            we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize
            the content on the website and on other websites. Some of these
            third parties may participate in Digital Advertising Alliance
            ("DAA") and Network Advertising Initiative
            ("NAI") programs, which provide mechanisms for you to opt
            out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members
            at www.aboutads.info and optout.networkadvertising.org. Opting out
            of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all
            advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or
            our agents or representatives.
Location Data Opt-Out.
In some cases, you may also adjust the settings on your
            personal device or mobile device to allow or restrict the sharing of
            location information. For example, the "location"
            permissions on your personal device or mobile device may allow you
            to elect whether to never share location information with us, to
            share location information only while you are using the Services or
            always share location information even if you are not using the
            Services. If you elect to not share your location information, you
            may be unable to access certain features of our Services related to
            wagering. Also, in the event that you prevent the sharing of
            location information, we may still estimate your general location
            based on the IP address you use to access Services other than those
            that enable wagering.
Security of Your Personal Information
We use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of
          the personal information submitted to us both during transmission and
          after we receive it.
Children’s Privacy
We are committed to the preservation of online privacy for all of our
          visitors, including children. We sell products and provide services
          intended for purchase by adults (i.e., those 21 and older and of
          lawful betting age). If you engage with our Services, you are
          representing that you are an adult lawfully permitted to engage with
          our Services. We will not knowingly collect any personal information
          from minors or those under the age of 21 without the consent of that
          child's parent or guardian. If you are under the age of 21, you
          are not authorized to use the Services. If we become aware that
          personal information from an individual under age 21 has been
          collected, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such
          information from our database. To notify us if you believe that we
          have information for an individual under 21 or a minor without
          parental consent, please contact us
using the information in the Contact Us section
.

Welcome. This Global Privacy Statement relates to Socure Inc. (collectively, “Socure,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), a platform providing digital identity verification and fraud prevention products and services (the “Services”), and describes

How to Contact Us
. This Global Privacy Statement applies when we verify your identity on behalf of our business customers and prospects, when we market and sell our Services to you, and when you visit and engage with us in person or online, across our websites and digital content (the “Sites”).
Subject to applicable law, we may update this Global Privacy Statement from time to time by publishing a new version on this website. Socure also maintains a
DocV Privacy Notice
that applies specifically to Socure’s predictive document verification product (“DocV”). If our business customers use DocV and our other products and services, both policies apply. (If you’re not sure which products our customers use, ask them!)
How Socure Works
Socure is a platform that provides digital identity verification and fraud prevention products and services to business customers, who provide us with your personal information so we can verify your identity and prevent fraud. Socure uses predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to assess the information we receive from you, our customers, and our our data sources to answer a number of questions relating to identity verification and fraud prevention, such as:
Does this identity actually exist?
Have we seen this identity before?
Does the identity belong to the person who provided it?
What fraud risks are associated with the identity?
Because Socure does not provide any goods or services directly to consumers, you may not interact directly with Socure (outside of DocV, described above). This means that Socure processes your personal information at the request our business customers who might need to assess risks associated with an online transaction, like opening a bank account, wiring money, placing a bet on a sporting event, or updating the contact information in your account.
Only the Socure business customer decides:  (a) whether and for what reason(s) your information is provided to Socure; (b) which elements of personal information we collect and analyze on their behalf; (c) which alternative verification methods are available; and (d) whether and under what circumstances to accept, review, or reject a particular transaction.
Personal Information We Collect (and the Sources)
Socure may collect personal information about you from our business customers or prospects, from your device, from you, from data vendors, and/or from our third-party service providers. The categories of personal information we collect in connection with the products and services we provide our business customers are outlined below, together with information about the sources.
Chart A summarizes the categories of personal information Socure collects about individuals whose identities we verify on behalf of our business customers. Chart B summarizes the personal information Socure collects about individuals who work for our business customers and prospects.

Where We Store and Transfer Your Personal Information

perform identity verification and fraud prevention services on behalf of our business customers;
help ensure the security and integrity of the Services;

Personal information used to verify your identity in connection with your exercise of a data rights request will be deleted within
7 days
of verification. Records of your request to exercise your data rights, and our compliance with our fulfillment obligations, are maintained in accordance with applicable law.
How We Protect Your Information
Socure uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, in accordance with applicable law, and we require our customers and third-party service providers to do the same. Biometric information receives the same rigorous privacy and security protections as other sensitive personal information. This includes encryption in transit and at rest, strict access controls, data minimization, and data governance procedures. Socure’s data protection practices are audited on a recurring basis, and we maintain ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 certifications. That said, there is simply no way to guarantee that any safeguards or security measures will be sufficient to prevent a security incident.
Your Data Rights
Generally, you have the right to file or lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority and to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights. In addition, based on where you reside, you may be subject to one or more of the following data rights:
Right to Know / Be Informed

Right to Appeal
a refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after you receive the initial decision.
Any withdrawal of consent only applies to future processing and does not impact prior processing conducted in accordance with your prior freely given, explicit consent. The right to data portability does not apply to Socure, but we use reasonable efforts to provide you with information in response to an access request that is in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
How to Exercise Your Data Rights

To exercise your rights as they relate to Socure’s data

Data Rights Form

Verifiable Data Protection Rights Requests:
Socure will use commercially reasonable methods to confirm that you submitted a verifiable request, where applicable or required.

In particular, Socure remains responsible and liable under the Data Privacy Framework Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Socure proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the EU-U.S DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S DPF, and the Swiss-U.S DPF Principles, Socure commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to the EU-U.S DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S DPF, and the Swiss-U.S DPF Principles. European Union, United Kingdom, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints should first contact Socure at

Global Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains how we process the data of people who use our verification or authentication services.  There are separate sections at the end of the policy covering how we process data of job applicants and business contacts.
1. Introduction
Privacy is a fundamental human right. Your personal information is exactly that, yours. At IDVerse, we want to keep it that way. That is why privacy is paramount to us, in everything we do, and we are committed to respecting your privacy.
Our Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, hold, use, store and disclose your personal and sensitive information. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time by publishing changes to it on our website. We encourage you to check our website periodically to ensure that you are aware of our current Privacy Policy.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘us’ ‘we’ or ‘our’ means the IDVerse’s different businesses (listed at the end of this Policy). We are bound by different global data protection legislation depending on where you live, including the EU and UK GDPR, various US state laws (including the Californian Consumer Privacy Act) and the Australian Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988.
Personal information includes information about an individual that is reasonably identifiable. For example, this may include your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details.
Sensitive information includes biometric information we process when we perform face matching.
2. Special Biometric Data Notice for Illinois, Washington and Texas Residents
For residents of Illinois, Washington or Texas, if our clients require you to provide us with any document that contains your photograph or if you need to verify or authenticate your identity by providing a photograph or video of yourself, the data derived from your face that we collect and process on behalf of our clients to provide the verification or authentication service may be considered biometric data. We will only use your data for the purpose of verifying or authenticating your identity and the prevention of fraud, and for no other purpose. We do not transfer your biometric data to anyone else. Your biometric data will be stored as long as required for these purposes, but no longer than three years.
3. What personal and sensitive information do we collect and hold?
We may collect and hold the following types of personal information and sensitive information:
name;
mailing or street address;
mobile telephone number;
email address;
age or date of birth;
nationality;
government related identifiers, such as your licence number and class, Medicare number, state or national ID card number, passport number, and birth or marriage certificate number;
indicators of fraudulent activity;
other information identifiable from scanned documents you provide, such as your organ donor status, health information or other sensitive data on the document;
biometric information, such as our ‘Feature ID’ (a one way hash) we create from video footage or photographs of your face;
information obtained from fraud-prevention services and document verification services;
your device ID, device type, geo-location information, computer and connection information, IP address and standard web log information; and
any other personal information that may be required in order to provide our services to our clients.
4. How do we collect your personal and sensitive information?
We may collect these types of personal or sensitive information either directly from you, or from third parties when you use our verification or authentication services.
We automatically receive and record certain information from your mobile device. This may include such information as the third-party website or application into which the services are integrated, the date and time that you use the services, your IP address and domain name, your software and hardware attributes (including operating system, device model, and hashed device fingerprint information), and your general geographic location (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region).
Where you provide us with personal or sensitive information on behalf of someone else, you must ensure you are permitted to provide us with their personal or sensitive information. You also need to tell them how to find a copy of this Privacy Policy.
We may receive personal, sensitive or anonymised information about you from our clients where they make use of our services. This information may include a client ID that identifies you in a database, as well as the categories of information set out above.
Retention of your personal and sensitive information
We will retain your personal and sensitive information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your personal and sensitive information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
5. Why do we collect, hold, use and disclose personal and sensitive information?
We are using your personal data on behalf of our clients. The one exception is where we are providing services under the UK Digital Identity and Attribute Trust Framework, please see Section 14 below.
Purpose
We may collect, hold, use and disclose your personal and sensitive information for the following purposes:
to provide verification or authentication services, where you are seeking to access one of our clients’ products or services (or the products or services of third parties, where our clients act as brokers, resellers, referrers or representatives of such parties);
to prevent fraudulent behaviour being undertaken on our products for any of our clients;
to operate, protect, improve and optimise our website or apps, business and our clients’ and users’ experience, such as to perform analytics, conduct research and create new products. We use synthetic data or information about the characteristics of documents (with no personal data) to train our algorithms; and
to comply with our legal obligations, and perhaps to resolve any disputes that we may have with any of our clients or users.
We may also be entitled to use personal information for any purpose which is related to the above purposes.
We do
not
use your personal data or biometric data to train our algorithms.
We do
not
transfer your biometric data to any other party (with the exception of the client for whom we are verifying your identity for).
We may use de-identified, aggregated information to share insights about users of our services, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of such services.
How we process your data
As soon as we have collected data from you we perform fully automated checks on the evidence on behalf of our clients. Our fully automated checks could include some or all of the following:
extraction of the data from the provided documents using OCR technology;
a visual assessment of the provided documents for signs of fraud; including tampering, photocopying, deepfakes, replacing photos etc;
ensuring that the selfie presented is of a real person in a live environment. We can detect when screens, photos, masks and deepfakes are submitted; and
a biometric face match between your selfie and the photo image on the documents.
We return to our client the evidence collected and an indication of whether our technology has detected any issues. We are looking for signs of identity fraud in the evidence you provide to us. Our client will then decide what its next steps will be. Our clients configure how long we store your personal data for, which could be as short as one week, and there is a maximum period of three years for biometric data.
If we think you are impersonating someone, using a synthetic identity or using a stolen identity then we may retain unique identifiers in a fraud database to allow us to identify if you try to commit fraud against us or our clients again. Please contact

if you think your identifier is in our fraud database and should not be.
6. Other circumstances where we may disclosure of your personal or sensitive information
Business Transactions
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your personal and sensitive information may be transferred. We will endeavour to provide notice before your personal and sensitive information is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
Law enforcement
Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your personal and sensitive information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).
Other legal requirements
On occasion in certain limited circumstances we may disclose your personal and sensitive information in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
comply with a legal obligation;
protect and defend the rights or property of the Company;
prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with our services;
protect the personal safety of users of the services or the public; and
protect against legal liability.
7. Do we use your personal information for direct marketing?
We do not use personal information provided to us or collected as part of our identity verification or authentication services for marketing purposes.
If you are a business contact please see Section 20 below.
8. To whom do we disclose your personal information?
We may disclose personal information (but not sensitive or biometric data) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy to:
companies within the IDVerse group where necessary to provide our services to our clients;
our clients and third parties (where our clients act as resellers or representatives of such parties), where you are seeking to access their products and/or services and are required to verify your identity in order to do so. We do not sell any of your data to any third party;
our employees and contractors, for the purposes of managing our products and systems and providing our services;
third party suppliers and service providers (including providers of document verification services to help us verify the validity of identity documents you disclose to us, and other providers for the operation of our websites and/or our business or in connection with providing our products and services to you);
specific third parties authorised by you to receive information held by us;
other persons, including government agencies, regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies, or as required, authorised or permitted by law; and
as otherwise required or permitted by law.
9. Overseas transfer of personal and sensitive information
We use localised instances of cloud hosting so that overseas transfers are limited.
European, UK and Middle Eastern clients – all data is processed within the EU or the UK
Americas – all data is processed within the USA
Asia-Pacific – all data is processed within Australia or Singapore
We may make limited transfers of personal data within our group companies to Australia or the USA from the UK or the EU in order to provide support and customer success services to our clients. The transfers are made under the EU approved Standard Contractual Clauses (with the UK addendum).
To send you an SMS message to start the verification journey your mobile number only is processed in the USA (other than Australian residents for whom we use an Australian supplier). Our SMS provider (Twilio Inc) exports the mobile number under its European Commission approved Binding Corporate Rules. To check that your address is in the right format we send your address only to a supplier in either the UK, the USA or Australia. Our suppliers all export the address under the EU approved Standard Contractual Clauses (with the UK addendum). Those suppliers are ISO 27001 and SOC2 certified.
10. Security and storage
We take data security very seriously and are externally audited against the ISO 27001 and SOC2 Type 2 standards each year. We take reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures to protect your personal and sensitive information against loss or unauthorised access, use, interference, modification, or deletion. User data is hosted by AWS in cloud environments which we manage and control.
Among other things, we encrypt personal and sensitive information both in transit and at rest and we implement robust disaster recovery and business continuity procedures.
Personal and sensitive information will be held in a secure environment. We have security measures in place which are intended to protect personal and sensitive information. The key methods of securing the storage of personal and sensitive information include:
Secure access to electronic and physical records containing personal and sensitive information, via password protected access permissions to systems and security-protected access to filing cabinets and storage;
Access only to authorised OCR Labs employees and contractors that require access to perform their daily duties; and
Varying access levels depending on the level of the authority and the type of personal and sensitive information required to be accessed.
Controls relating to how personal and sensitive information is extracted from the secure environment and how it is used and distributed. We also regularly conduct security audits, vulnerability scans, and penetration tests to ensure compliance with security best practices and standards.
We do not hold any contact details for you. In the unlikely event your personal data is compromised whilst in our possession we will inform our client for whom we are holding your data, and they are likely to inform you in line with their own privacy obligations.
11. Unsolicited personal and sensitive information
There may be circumstances where an individual provides us with the personal or sensitive information about another person. Where we receive unsolicited personal information which we do not require for the purposes we have outlined above, we will destroy or de-identity that information as soon as practicable (if it is lawful and reasonable to do so).
12. Accessing and correcting your information
You can access the personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact information below.
Sometimes, we may not be able to provide you with access to all of your personal information and, where this is the case, we will provide you with a written notice explaining why. We may also need to verify your identity when you request your personal information.
We note that we may not have stored your personal information where it was collected by us to perform verification services and such services have been completed.
If you think that any personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, outdated, incorrect or incomplete, please contact us promptly and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is corrected.
13. Your Rights
Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data under GDPR
When we are providing our services to our clients we act as a processor to our clients (who are the controllers) – please see the exception in section 14
below
where IDVerse is in fact the controller only in the UK under the Digital Identity and Attribute Trust Framework. It is up to our clients to establish the legal basis of processing, but it will be under one of the following conditions:
Consent: you have given your consent for processing biometric data for identification or authentication purposes and also for the automatic processing of your personal data. This is the
only
ground under which we will process your biometric information.
Performance of a contract: processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of an agreement between you and our clients.
Legitimate interests: processing of your personal data is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our client which does not unduly prejudice you.
Your Rights
We undertake to respect the confidentiality of your personal data and to guarantee you can exercise your rights.
You have the right under this Privacy Policy, and by law depending on your jurisdiction, to:
Request access to your personal data.
The right to access, update or delete the information we have on you.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
You have the right to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. We offer individuals we are verifying the opportunity to amend incorrectly captured data as part of the identity verification journey.
Object to processing of your personal data.
This right exists where our client is relying on a legitimate interest as the legal basis for its processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to its processing of your personal data on this ground.
Request erasure of your personal data.
You have the right to ask our clients to delete or remove personal data that we are holding when there is no good reason for us to continue processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal data.
We give the ability to our clients to export your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. You can ask them for a copy of the data we hold on their behalf about you.
Automated Decision Making.
The service we provide is fully automated in providing to our clients an indication of the risk of fraud, and our clients will use our results as part of their overall decision as to your identity. You will need to contact our client if you want to ask for information about how it uses the results of our fraud checks.
Withdraw your consent.
You have the right to withdraw your consent on using your data. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to certain specific functionalities of the service.
Exercising of Your Data Protection Rights
You may exercise your rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition by contacting us. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests. If you make a request, we will try our best to respond to you as soon as possible. Where our client is the data controller we will pass on the request to them.
You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about Our collection and use of your personal data. For more information, if you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, please contact Your local data protection authority in the EEA or the UK.
14. UK Digital Identity and Attribute Trust Framework – IDVerse as controller
IDVerse’s service allows one time verification of a living person’s identity. This verification is conducted under the rules set out in the UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology’s UK digital identity and attributes trust framework (the “
UKDIATF
“).
IDVerse is certified under the UKDIATF for identity checks for the purpose of a DBS (disclosure and barring service), Right to Work and Right to Rent checks.  You do not have to pay IDVerse for this service, but IDVerse will charge its clients.
Under the UKDIATF IDVerse is acting as the data controller of your personal data because IDVerse must determine how your data is processed and must make a decision if you are correctly verified in accordance with the UKDIATF rules. Once IDVerse transfers your data to its clients then those clients are independently a data controller of your data.
How IDVerse processes your data lawfully under the UKDIATF
Consent
: for the processing of biometric data (your face for matching and liveness checks) and the automated decision making, you need to give explicit consent to IDVerse; and
Legitimate interests
: for the processing of your non-biometric personal data IDVerse is processing under its legitimate interests to provide a service to its clients.
Data Sharing under the UKDIATF
All data collected from you is shared with our clients. Section 3 above lists the data collected.
IDVerse will use third party data suppliers to check for indicators of fraud and the accuracy of the data provided:
Synectics
: We check your information against National SIRA and NFI databases. You can read more about Synectics here:
https://www.synectics-solutions.com/privacy-policy
Loqate, a GBG Group plc company
: we check that your provided address meets the expected structure and format by sending just your address to Loqate.
Twilio
: we send just your mobile number to Twilio so that they can send an SMS link to your mobile.
Please see sections 13 and 17 for your rights and how to make a complaint.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
