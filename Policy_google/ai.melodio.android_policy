How do we protect your Personal Data
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Data that we collect and process. The measures that we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data. For example, we adopt encryption at rest to secure all user data (including database files and backups) and use security keys for data management. We adopt encryption in transit through TLS 1.2 protocols to protect data flow in the public network environment from user devices to servers and from servers to servers. We will also ensure the effective implementation of these technical measures through code review mechanisms. In addition, we periodically test the applications and systems for vulnerabilities and security issues, and take access control measures such as access tokens and multi-factor authentication to ensure information security.
Please be aware and understand that we cannot ensure an absolutely secure Internet. If you find that your Personal Data is breached, please contact us by our contact details so that we can take the corresponding measures.
In the event of any accident, force majeure event or other circumstances leading to the breach of your Personal Data, we will make every effort to control the situation and promptly inform you of the cause, the security measures we have taken and you can take and other relevant information. In the event of a security incident related to Personal Data, we will report such incident to the competent authorities in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, promptly investigate the problem, and take the emergency measures.
5. How do we store your Personal Data
Cross-border Transfer
We deploy local servers in the United States. For the need of our global operation and security management, your Personal Data may be transferred to and processed in the aforesaid jurisdictions where our affiliated entities are based in, which may be different from the jurisdiction you locate. Such jurisdictions may not provide the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. Under such circumstances, we will take necessary and appropriate safeguards to ensure the security of your Personal Data in transit and require that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level of protection and security in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws and regulations.
Retention Period
We will store your Personal Data to the extent as necessary for the proper business needs of our company (e.g., for the purposes of providing service to you and complying with the requirements of laws, tax and finance), except as provided otherwise by applicable laws or regulations. When there is no such need to use your Personal Data or the retention period expires according to applicable laws or regulations, we will delete or anonymize your Personal Data.

If you want to access, correct, or delete your Personal Data, or if you want to file a complaint, withdraw consent, or exercise other rights under applicable laws and regulations, please contact us by our contact details.

If we process your Personal Data based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we have carried out prior to your withdrawal of consent, nor will it affect the lawfulness of our processing of your Personal Data based on a lawful basis other than your consent.

Special notice to California residents
If you are a California resident, this section provides a special notice and applies to you. For California residents, Personal Data in this section is equivalent to “Personal Information” that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
California Shine the Light Law
: California residents may request a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed certain Personal Data about you for marketing purposes. You may make one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. You may request this information by contacting us using the contact details provided in the “How to contact us” section below. Please allow up to thirty (30) days for a response.
California Minors
: If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available information that you have submitted to Melodio, you may request removal by contacting Melodio using the contact details provided in the “How to contact us” section below. When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want to be removed and provide Melodio with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information is located, so that we can find it. Melodio is not required to remove any information where: (i) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain the information; (ii) the information was not posted by you; (iii) the information has been anonymized by Melodio so that you cannot be identified from such information; (iv) you don't follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (v) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the information. Removal of your information from the services does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. In addition, materials that you have posted may be republished or reposted by another user or third party. Please note, Melodio is not required to destroy the information; Melodio’s obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the information or render it invisible to other users and the public.
Do Not Sell My Personal Data
: Where applicable, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides you with the right to opt out of the “sale” of your Personal Data. We generally do not directly sell your Personal Data in the conventional sense (i.e., for monetary or other valuable consideration). Like many social and entertainment mobile applications, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Data to business partners for their use. Making Personal Data (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. To request that Melodio may not “sell” your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details provided in the “How to contact us” section below. Please note, some transfers of your Personal Data may not be considered “sales” and certain exemptions may apply under the CCPA, such as sharing aggregated demographic and interest data of users. Your selection does not affect other sharing of your data, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. You may still see some advertising, regardless of your selection.
Do Not Track
: At this time, we are not aware of worldwide uniform or consistent industry standard or definition for responding to, processing, or communicating Do Not Track signals. Accordingly, our services may be unable to respond to “Do Not Track” requests from browsers. In addition, when you use our services, we and third parties may use tracking technologies to collect your Personal Data about your online activities for a variety of purposes, including serving you advertising and personalized content. If you want to opt out of having your online activity and device data collected by third parties, there are a number of tools and methods that any user may use. For example, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes. Please note that using these tools to opt out of tracking and targeting does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using Melodio, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties. It will exclude you, however, from interest-based advertising conducted through relevant networks and platforms, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.
Additional Information
: If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us. To the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
