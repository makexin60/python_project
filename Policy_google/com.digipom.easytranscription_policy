Last updated: October 17, 2024
This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains who we are, how we collect, share and use Personal Data about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.
We are Digipom Inc. (“Digipom”), a duly incorporated company in the province of Quebec, Canada. We are the creators of Easy Voice Recorder (“EVR”), Easy Voice Recorder Pro (“EVR Pro”), and more. It is the policy of Digipom to respect your privacy, and the privacy of all users of our applications and Services. This Policy applies to Personal Data that we collect through our mobile applications and other products (“Apps”) and websites we control, such as www.digipom.com (“Website”) (collectively “Services”). The Services are also governed by the
Terms of Use
. Digipom reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to modify the Policy.
Your privacy is very important to us and we want you to know everything we do and don’t do with the data you provide. Our guiding principle is that any data we collect from you will be treated with the utmost care and respect, and every effort will be made to ensure the data is kept private.
If you have any questions about the Policy, please contact:
Digipom Legal and Privacy Services
privacy@digipom.com
Compliance with Privacy Laws
Digipom is committed to complying with the privacy and data protection laws applicable to you. These include but are not limited to: (1) the “GDPR”, the European data protection law which stands for “General Data Protection Regulation”, with the official name Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council; (2) “PIPEDA” (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), which is the Canadian data protection law that applies to our activities in Canada; (3) the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which applies to our activities in the United States in certain circumstances; and (4) Brazil’s
Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados
(“LGPD”).
Under applicable law, Digipom Inc. is the “data controller” of Personal Data collected through the Services. “Personal Data” is any data that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with an identified or identifiable natural person, or a specific household. For the purposes of this Policy, “Personal Data” is equivalent to “Personal Information” as defined in the CCPA and PIPEDA.
What Personal Data does Digipom collect?
The Personal Data we may collect about you through the Services falls into the general categories described below. Please see further in the section “Categories of Personal Data Collected under the CCPA”.
Information that you provide voluntarily
Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide Personal Data voluntarily. For example, we may ask for certain information in order to use features in our Apps, register an account with us, subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us, such as:
your name, email address or other contact details.
any information you submit to our customer service team in the App or via email.
The Personal Data that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be explained to you when we ask you to provide your Personal Data.
Information we collect automatically
When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered Personal Data under applicable data protection laws, such as:
Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-app usage, session length, preferred settings, which in-app advertisements you may have viewed, crash reports, and the means by which you were referred to our Services).
Your IP address, device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, other device information, and your general geographic location (e.g. country or city location) based on your IP address.
“Advertising ID” includes the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple, and the Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”) on Android. These are unique identifiers for mobile devices that advertisers use for interest-based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow tracking across apps. These identifiers can be reset from the device’s settings. On Apple, you can opt out by choosing the “limit ad tracking” option in the privacy settings. On Android, you can opt out by choosing “Opt out of interest based ads.”
Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognize your device when you use websites and applications.
“Device information” means device type, model, manufacturer, operating system and language, or other technical data like supported application programming interfaces (“APIs”), screen size, processor, or a combination of this data, available from a device for a developer to check the device’s compatibility with a particular application.
Some of this information may be collected using cookies and/or similar technologies, such as software development kits (“SDKs”). The Services may use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags, local shared objects, hardware-based device identifiers, flash cookies, operating system-based identifiers, clear GIFs and web beacons. Cookies are pieces of data that sites and services can set on your browser or device that can be read on future visits. We may expand our use of cookies to save additional data as new features are added to our Services. However, you can disable cookies by changing your browser settings. Further information about how to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s help screen.
Information we obtain from third party sources
(a) Third party service providers.
We may receive Personal Data about you from third-party sources. We may obtain your Personal Data, for example, when you installed our App or when, prior to installation, you click on an advertisement for the App (see the “Third-Party Advertisements” section below for more information).
In order to better understand our users of the Services, we may conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the information collected. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Digipom may use Google Analytics (see
http://www.google.com/analytics/
), Google Firebase Analytics (see
https://firebase.google.com/features/analytics/
), Firebase Crashlytics (see
https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics
) or other similar services to collect such information.
The Application makes use of Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting (see
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357
) which gives Digipom certain demographic and interest information about our Application users. None of this information, however, can identify you personally to Digipom. The information may be used to serve you advertisements that will be of interest to you. You can disable this feature through your Android settings of your Device or the Google Settings App. You can also opt out of such Google advertising at any time by visiting your Google Ads Settings page (see
https://www.google.com/settings/ads
).
(b) Advertising partners.
From time to time, we may also receive Personal Data about you from other third-party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement directing you to one of our Services (such as an ad for one of our Apps in another publishers’ app), we will be provided with Data about which ad network and advertising campaign the install originated from. Please see the Advertising section below for more information.
Categories of Personal Data Collected under the CCPA
We collect the following categories of Personal Data as defined in the CCPA, and have done so in the past 12 months:
Identifiers (your name, email or other contact information, when provided);
Internet or other electronic network activity information on our Internet Web sites and applications, including, but not limited to, browsing history, search history, and information regarding your interaction with an Internet Web site, application, or advertisement; and
Geolocation data.
What we don’t collect
Under no circumstances does Digipom collect, share or otherwise make copies of any recordings you make using any of our apps (hereinafter “Recordings”) or transcriptions you make using any of our apps (hereinafter “Transcripts”) and any reference to Personal Data in the present Policy does not include Recordings or Transcripts, or any Personal Data about you or any third party included in the Recordings or Transcripts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may make copies of Recordings or Transcripts via application or operating system features (such as the share menu or via file system access), and/or by uploading them to various cloud services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and iCloud. However, Digipom has no access whatsoever to these copies and therefore any Personal Data about you or any third party contained in the copies of Recordings or Transcripts is also not covered by this Policy. Furthermore, some applications include a function called “AI Assistant,” which allows you to submit plain language queries (“Queries”) and get “Responses” provided by the third party OpenAI. If you use the AI Assistant, your Transcript is processed by OpenAI along with your Query, but we never store it. None of the Queries or Responses are ever stored by Digipom, and therefore any Personal Data that may be included in them is not covered by this Policy.
How we use your Personal Data
We use your Personal Data for the following purposes:
To provide and operate our Services
To provide you with the correct versions of our apps (e.g. knowing which language to make our apps available to you in).
To improve our Services and keep them secure
To respond to your customer support requests (e.g. if you write to us with a complaint),
To receive error messages about any issues you or your device encounter with our Services to enable us to fix bugs and interoperability issues,
To detect and prevent illegal activities,
To track App installs (e.g. for purposes of measuring the effectiveness of marketing campaigns),
To conduct optional user feedback surveys,
To understand you, your preferences and user traffic to enhance your experience and enjoyment of our Services,
To conduct research.
To personalize our Services
To remember you the next time you visit one of our Services,
To communicate with you about promotions, rewards, upcoming events, and other news about products and services we offer.
For promotional activities, including marketing and advertising
To provide you with in-app offers and rewards based on your in-app behaviors,
To serve you with relevant targeted advertisements (necessary to fund our Services),
To make you offers to purchase in-app items on discount based on your in-app activity and purchase history,
To send you marketing communications and/or newsletters about rewards and promotions if you have subscribed to them.
Other
To comply with our legal obligations,
To exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or to protect your vital interests or those of any other person,
To prevent and/or detect fraud or fraudulent behavior.
Advertising
We use advertising to fund our Services and to make some of our apps or versions of our apps available for free. We show third-party advertising in our Apps and also advertise our Services via third parties. We want to provide you with more detail about how we use information for advertising, both in our properties and in third-party properties.
When you view ads in Digipom properties (e.g. in our Apps)
To enable us to show in-app ads, we may send your advertising ID, IP address and device information to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our Apps and on third-party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. Digipom does not control which specific ads are shown in our apps (this is controlled by the ad networks), but we do prohibit certain types of ads.
Advertising IDs are used by ad networks for a number of purposes, including, for example, to:
Limit the number of times you see the same ad.
Ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not automated “bots”.
Serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID, your engagement with other brands and ads which is recorded using your advertising ID, and to use your general geographic area.
Other brands may buy ad placements via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in our Apps. The ad network or ad exchange acts as an intermediary between the other app companies and Digipom. In order for the ad network to charge the company purchasing the ad, clicks from the ad and potential installs of other developers’ apps are tracked. These views, clicks and installs from ads are measured using the Advertising ID.
Track which apps you have used to market you similar kind of apps. Your IP address is typically used by advertisers to identify your general geographic location, for example, your country, state and, sometimes, your city.
When you view Digipom ads on third-party services
Digipom also advertises its Apps on other apps by asking ad networks to place ads for audiences that will be interested in them, determined using Advertising IDs. Ad networks use Advertising IDs for this and other purposes, including, for example, to:
Measure ad effectiveness (including total views, clicks and installs generated by its advertising in other publishers’ apps),
Not display ads for an app a user is already using. Digipom may send a list of active users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. The ad network then excludes these users from seeing the ad.
Third-party advertisements
Where you have downloaded one of our apps, we may use Google, a third-party vendor, to serve advertisements in the App, using the AdMob system (see
http://www.admob.com/home/privacy
).
In addition to Google advertisements, from time to time we may allow other third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous data when you use the Application. This list currently includes:
Fluct (see
https://corp.fluct.jp/privacy/ads/
)
InMobi (see
https://www.inmobi.com/privacy-policy
)
Mobfox (see
https://www.mobfox.com/privacy-policy/
)
Pubmatic (see
https://pubmatic.com/legal/privacy-policy/
)
Tappx (see
https://www.tappx.com/privacy-policy/
)
Unity (see

Applovin Ads (see
https://www.applovin.com/privacy/
)
Huawei AppGallery only:
Petal Ads (see
https://consumer.huawei.com/en/privacy/privacy-policy/
)
You can opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by changing the privacy settings of your device and selecting “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt out of interest-based ads” (Android).
Legal basis for processing personal data
Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where (i) we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, (ii) the processing is in our legitimate interests and not superseded by your rights, or (iii) we have your consent to do so.
(a) Under our terms of service, “performance of contract” as a legal basis for processing your Personal Data refers to when we make the App and Services available to you, provide customer support, integrate Apps with technology and distribution platforms such as Apple iOS and Google Android, and inform you of service-related changes and App progress.
(b) We process your Personal Data on the basis of our legitimate interests for example when we provide you the App and App events, serve interest-based advertisements to you (both in-app and on third-party properties), carry out marketing, keep our apps secure, for engineering purposes, analyzing the users’ behavior across our Apps, moderating chat discussion.
(c) We have a “legal obligation” to process your Personal Data when complying with a legal obligation, such as the preventing a crime or fraud or maintaining tax records.

Who does Digipom share my Personal Data with?
We may share your Personal Data with the following types of recipients:

(c) With a
potential or actual buyer (and its agents and advisers)
in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your Personal Data solely for the purposes disclosed in this Policy, and adhere to all the other obligations in this Policy.

any other person, with your consent
for such disclosure.
Categories of Personal Data disclosed under the CCPA

Geolocation data.
Does Digipom sell my Personal Data?
Digipom does not sell your Personal Data to any third party.
How does Digipom keep my Personal Data secure?
Digipom uses standard industry practice (physical, electronic and procedural) to protect all data collected (including Personal Data) secure. We take reasonable steps to protect the Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what Personal Data you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data via the Internet.
Data retention
We retain Personal Data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so, for example, to provide you with a Service you have requested, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. We generally retain Personal Data so long as it may be relevant to the purposes identified herein. To dispose of Personal Data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Personal Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time, but it will be deleted as soon as practicable.

privacy@digipom.com
.
(e) You have the right to
file a complaint
with a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

However, these countries are limited to countries with particular circumstances that protect your data, specifically:
Canada

the Standard Contractual Clauses
for the transfer of personal data outside the EEA; and (2) have signed agreements with us or have informed us that they are GDPR-compliant.
Notwithstanding the foregoing certain of our advertising network partners may transfer unique identifiers including your IP address (considered personal data under the GDPR) to their advertisers who may be located outside Canada or the USA. You can avoid this transfer by opting out of our advertising, as described in the Advertising section of this Policy.

Beacons, Pixels and Tags: Beacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, on websites by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page.
A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.
Mobile SDK: A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a beacon or tag (see Beacons and Tags above). The SDK is a piece of computer code that publishers include in their apps to enable ads to be shown and to enable related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, including by collecting and analyzing data which is available through the device on which the mobile SDK is installed.
Cookie: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.
Non-Cookie Technology: Today’s online world is becoming increasingly complex, with a proliferation of new devices, software platforms, online services and other technology. As such, cookies are not always available. Therefore, companies are using alternative methods to distinguish devices. For example, some platforms, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising. Most mobile devices are assigned unique identifiers that also may be used to distinguish devices. Additionally, it is possible to use mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses about recognizing devices.

ABOUT US AND OUR AD SERVICES
PubMatic provides technology via our advertising platform (the “
Platform
”) and related advertising tools (collectively the “
Ad Services
”) that allow Publishers to make space on their websites, mobile apps, internet-connected or over-the-top TV (known as ‘CTV’ and ‘OTT TV,’ respectively), or other digital properties available to show ads in order to generate revenue (what the advertising industry refers to as a ‘Supply Side Platform’ or ‘SSP’) and buyers to purchase the available space to display ads on these digital properties. In this Policy, we refer to those involved in selling ad space collectively as “
Publishers
”, those looking to buy ad space collectively as “
Media Buyers
” (including, for example advertisers, ad agencies, Demand-Side partners) and Media Buyers and Publishers together as “
Clients.
” Our Ad Services help Clients display relevant online advertising to the End Users who interact with Publishers’ digital properties and engage in planning and measurement to understand how these ads perform. This Policy applies only when we act as a “data controller” and not when we are a processor or service provider acting on behalf of our Clients.

PUBMATIC’S AD SERVICES &
PRIVACY – FULL POLICY
USER INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you visit or use a digital property that uses our technology, we (and our Clients) use and deploy Cookies to automatically collect certain information about you and your computer or other devices, such as your mobile device, CTV, or OTT TV device. While none of this technology provides us with directly identifiable information (meaning, it doesn’t include your name, clear text email address, phone number), it may be considered “
personal data
” or “
personal information”
in some jurisdictions. Altogether, the personal data or personal information discussed in this policy shall be “
User Information.
” PubMatic collects or assigns pseudonymous identifiers (“
Online Identifiers”)
to your browser or other devices to enable our Ad Services to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a browser or device is the same with which our Ad Services have previously interacted. These identifiers include:
cookie IDs (a unique ID randomly assigned by PubMatic to a browser);
unique online IDs (“
UUID
”) created by identity providers and used by our Clients;
mobile advertising IDs (a unique ID assigned by the mobile operating system (e.g., Apple ID for Advertising or Android Advertising ID)); or
CTV or OTT TV device identifier for advertising (a unique ID assigned by the OTT or CTV publisher).
If we (or our Media Buyers) can identify a browser or device, it increases the value of that advertisement to provide more content for you to enjoy. To opt out of our use of such technologies for interest-based advertising purposes, please follow the instructions for opting out, as described in “
Your Opt-Out Choices
” below. See PubMatic’s
Platform Cookie and Other Similar Technologies Policy
for more information on how PubMatic uses cookies and other similar technologies.
Our Ad Services may also automatically collect the following information and associate it with one of the identifiers described above (also User Information:
Browser and Device Information
, such as the IP address you use to connect to an online service; device type and model; manufacturer; operating system type and version (e.g. iOS or Android); web browser type and version (e.g., Chrome or Safari); user-agent; carrier name; time zone; network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular); and information about our Publisher’s apps and versions currently active on a device.
Information about an End User’s behavior on our Publishers digital properties
(“
Behavioral Information
“), such as information about how you interact with the pages of those digital properties, session start/stop time, and precise geolocation (including latitude and longitude coordinates, but only if the Publisher’s digital property has enabled location services on the device and the End User has granted the Publisher permission to collect and share this information for advertising purposes).
Information about ads serviced, viewed, or clicked on
, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether the End User interacted with the ad, the number of times an End User has seen the ad, and whether the End User visited the Media Buyer’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised (“
Ad Interaction
“).
Information about your location,
which we may derive from the approximate location of your device via your IP address (
“Geolocation Information”).
User Information we receive from third parties
We may also combine, merge and/or augment the User Information we collect about you with information received from Publishers and other Clients (such as our data providers) and may include:
Demographic or interest data, obfuscated user identifiers such as UUIDs, hashed email addresses and/or hashed phone numbers, and content viewed (“
Partner Provided Information
“). We do not intentionally collect or process sensitive User Information (e.g., social security numbers) and attempt to prohibit our Clients and partners from passing any such information to PubMatic.
Precise geolocation information collected through Digital Properties. We will not use precise geolocation information for interest-based advertising without your opt-in consent (“
Geolocation”).
We use this Geolocation to derive regions for ad performance reporting.
We work with Clients to help create or obtain groupings of End Users by one or more attributes (e.g., ‘cycling enthusiast’) for advertising purposes (“
Audience Segments”)
.
HOW WE USE THE USER INFORMATION
We process and/or disclose User Information for various business purposes, including to provide the Ad Services and to operate our business. This section will describe those purposes in detail and includes our data processing practices.
Numerous states within the United States have enacted consumer privacy laws that grant their residents certain rights and require additional disclosures (“
State Privacy Laws
”). If you are a resident of one of these states, this section applies to you.
Likewise, those located in the EEA or UK are also afforded various rights, including additional disclosures (
“UK & Europe Privacy Laws
”). Under UK & Europe Privacy Laws, we have established a legal basis for processing your personal information. In most instances, consent is the basis for PubMatic’s processing of User Information. If you do not consent with respect to PubMatic’s SSP, PubMatic may still solicit bids for advertising to be displayed to you but will not process your personal information. In some circumstances we may rely on our legitimate interest to collect and use your personal information, except where such interests are overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may use any of the data described in this Policy for the secondary purpose of detecting, preventing or otherwise addressing fraud, security, or technical issues, as well as to protect against harm to our rights, property, or safety, or that of the public. This is necessary for us to pursue our, your and our partners’ legitimate interests. If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “
Contacting Us
” heading below. Please note that we take appropriate measures to ensure that any processing of User Information is done in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations, and with care for protecting your privacy and User Information.
Serve and Deliver Ads (Ad Services).
Generally, we process User Information to provide our products and services (including the Ad Services) as described in this Platform Privacy Policy. This is what allows Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their Digital Properties and Media Buyers to bid on and fill that inventory with relevant ads, as well as to determine inventory value and to inform bid decisions (i.e., whether to purchase an ad impression or not, for creating segments for End Users matching, targeting of lookalike audiences or retargeting users). For example, when a Publisher has potential ad inventory to offer, we will send a “bid request” to Media Buyers which includes the information detailed in this privacy policy so that Media Buyers can determine if they want to purchase the ad impression.
Ad Reporting.
Provide information and reports to Media Buyers about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their Digital Property (including whether an advertised app has been installed). This information is used to analyze an advertising campaign’s performance.
Frequency Capping.
Using information from our Ad Services to prevent seeing the same ad too many times.
Targeted Advertising.
The method by which we predict likely commercial interests (e.g., sports or travel) based on activities across websites, mobile apps, and other Digital Properties over time. We will also supplement User Information with additional information we receive from third parties, such as third-party advertising segments or audiences, to allow us to customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to End Users and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting exposure to less relevant ads).
Location Based Advertising.
Location-based advertising, services, and content delivered in real-time using your device’s physical location (where permitted by law).
ID Syncs.
We may disclose cookie values to other advertising technology platforms so that they may match their identifier to our identifier.
Fraud Detection & Prevention (Security).
Identify invalid ad impressions, clicks, installs, or ad queries, protect us and our Publishers from fraudulent behavior, and protect the security of the Ad Services.
Business Operations & Improving the Ad Services.
These purposes include several processing activities supporting our ability to run the business for our Clients, such as to:
Facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Ad Services, as well as auditing, researching, and analyzing information to provide, protect, manage, and improve our Ad Services, develop new services, and ensure that our technologies function properly.
Calculate Ad Services usage levels, help diagnose server problems and administer the Ad Services.
Operate our business, such as billing, support, accounting, improving our internal operations, securing our systems, detecting fraudulent or illegal activity, and meeting our legal obligations.
We may disclose User Information to our service providers that store or process the User Information in furtherance of the services we offer via our Ad Services and on our behalf.
The following table illustrates the categories of User Information processed for each business purpose, the lawful basis under which we process User Information, and the categories of recipients of User Information where we engage third parties to augment our ability to provide the Ad Services.

We may disclose User Information in accordance with applicable laws, both within and outside of an individual’s country of residence for specific situations which include:
Where we need to comply with legal obligations or respond to requests from public and government authorities, even if they are outside your country of residence.
To enforce our terms and conditions, protect our operations or the operations of our affiliates, safeguard our rights, privacy, safety, or property, as well as the rights, privacy, safety, or property of our affiliates, you, or others;
When necessary to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; and
In connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
Cross-device and Cross-app targeting
Cross-device and cross-app targeting are strategies employed in digital advertising to effectively connect and interact with individuals across multiple devices and different mobile applications. These strategies aim to enhance the advertising experience by delivering more relevant and personalized ads to you, regardless of the devices or mobile apps you use.
Our Publishers, Media Buyers, and Clients may use information that we share with them to establish connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) for targeted advertising, analytics, and reporting purposes. They may create a match between your devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or web browsers, or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by you or someone in your household. For example, Media Buyers may deliver ads on a tablet based on activities you engaged in on your smartphone. To opt out of cross-device targeting practices, please follow the instructions located at “
Opting Out of Cross-Device Targeting
.”
Our Publishers and Clients also may use information about your activity across multiple, unaffiliated third-party mobile applications for targeted advertising, analytics, and reporting purposes. For example, if you use a travel app, these third parties may display travel-related ads to you on other, unrelated apps.
To opt out of cross-app targeting practices, please follow the instructions located at “
Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising for Mobile Advertising Identifiers
” in the “
Your Privacy Choices
” section of the
Opt Out webpage
.
HOW WE DISCLOSE USER INFORMATION
Because of the role that PubMatic plays in the advertising ecosystem, many of the use cases described above involve a transfer of data to third parties – often to a Publisher or a Media Buyer. For example, when a Publisher works with us to fill an ad on one of their digital properties, we share information with Media Buyers so that they can determine whether they want to show an ad on that property, how much they want to spend on that ad impression, and what ad to show. More detail on these disclosures is provided below. For the purposes described in this Policy, we share your User Information with the following categories of recipients:

AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “AppLovin”) operates a suite of tools for app developers and other businesses to automate and optimize the marketing and monetization of their platforms, products, or services by enabling the placement of different types of advertisements on digital properties including mobile apps, websites, and connected TV devices (collectively, the “Advertising Services” or “Services”).  As explained below, consumers interact with us in a few ways, primarily through advertisements served by AppLovin on behalf of advertisers.
The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our Services and advertising platform, and our corporate website at www.applovin.com (the “Website”), as well as your choices related to that information.

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.
General Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer who downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services through advertisements served within a digital property, we may collect certain information, including the following:
Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;
Carrier;
Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);
Network connection type and speed;
IP Address;
Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services;
HTTP header information;
Advertising IDs (IDFA/GAID/Amazon FOSAID);
Vendor IDs (IDFV);
App Set IDs; and
Advertising and tracking preferences and restrictions.
Application publishers may choose to share with us additional information including your age or year of birth, gender, email, phone number, and interest segments for purposes of their own direct ad serving.  We do not retain this data or pass it downstream to advertising partners.  Please see the applicable publisher’s privacy policy for more information about their use of first party data.
Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here
, current as of the date listed at the top of that page.
If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, please see the
“Manage Your Privacy Choices”
section below. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or Switzerland, you may also see the
“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.
Manage Your Privacy Choices:
To limit collection of information from mobile devices, please visit your device’s settings to set the “Limit Ad Track” or other similar features on your device. Additionally, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising within ads served by AppLovin. For detailed instructions, see

. You can also make choices about data collection for certain companies by visiting an industry consumer choice platform such as the NAI (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
) or DAA (
https://optout.aboutads.info/
).  You may still receive ads after limiting processing of information for interest-based advertising, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.

Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from, or serve advertisements to, children as defined and required by applicable laws. If you believe we have served an advertisement to a child or might have any personal information from or about a child, or if you believe a mobile application in which an AppLovin-served advertisement appeared may be designed for, directed to, or pass personal information knowingly from, children in violation of our policies, please contact us via email at
dataprotection@applovin.com
.
Data Security and Retention
We implement reasonable measures to help secure the information we collect through the Services. We retain the data we collect through the Services for up to 2 years.

Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals
If you are located in the European Union, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, the following additional provisions apply to you.
Data Privacy Framework
AppLovin complies with the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, AppLovin commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact AppLovin at
dataprotection@applovin.com
. AppLovin refers unresolved complaints to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
for more information or to file a complaint.  These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you.
For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website.
Lawful Basis for Processing
On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide services to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning our products and services.
On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers, where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
If the processing of your personal data is necessary, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you if there is no other lawful basis for such processing. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.

Personal information refers to any type of information recorded electronically or otherwise relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, excluding information that has been anonymized. We may collect your personal data when you use our products or services or interact with us. Different types of data will be collected, depending on the service you use and your interactions with us. In some cases, you can choose not to provide such data, but this may prevent us from providing you with corresponding products or services, or may mean that we cannot respond to or resolve any issues you have raised.
When providing you with related products or services, we may also collect and summarize statistics, such as website visits, app downloads, and product sales volume, to understand how our products and services are used. For the purposes of this Statement, the preceding statistics are regarded as non-personal data. We will try our best to isolate your personal data from non-personal data and use them separately. The personal data mixed with non-personal data will still be treated as personal data.
We will collect and use your personal data only for the purposes described in this Statement and Product Privacy Notice. The following are some examples of personal data we may collect:

How Huawei Protects Your Personal Data
The security of your personal data is important to us. We have adopted standard industry practices to protect your personal data from unauthorized access/disclosure/use/modification, damage, or loss. To this end, we take the following measures:
1. We take all reasonable and feasible measures
                                                                        to ensure that the personal data collected is

3. We deploy access control mechanisms to permit only authorized access to your personal data. In addition, we limit the number of authorized personnel and implement hierarchical permission management based on service requirements and personnel levels. Access to personal data will be logged and reviewed by authorized personnel on a regular basis.

If any personal data security incident occurs, we will notify you, pursuant to local legal requirements, of the basic information about the security incident and its possible impact, measures that we have taken or will take, suggestions about active defense and risk mitigation, and remedial measures. The notification may take the form of an email, text message, push notification, etc. When it is difficult to inform data subjects individually, we will take appropriate and effective measures to release a Security Notice. In addition, we will also report the handling status of personal data security incidents as required by supervisory authorities.

Data subjects' requests must be submitted in
                                                                        writing. The requests are equally valid even if
                                                                        the requester does not specify the laws on which
                                                                        the requests are based. In general, verbal
                                                                        requests are not valid unless otherwise
                                                                        permitted by local laws.
Data subjects' requests can be submitted through the official website of Huawei Consumer BG, My HUAWEI app, or HUAWEI ID Privacy center. If a data subject initiates a request via a hotline, email, online customer service, service center, or other channels, we will instruct the data subject to raise an official request through one of the aforementioned channels to facilitate progress communication and result feedback. We have established the dedicated channels to protect their legitimate interests, ensure our business operation, and prevent their rights from being misused or fraudulently used.
(2) Validity of requests
Most laws require data subjects to comply with
                                                                        specific requirements when they initiate
                                                                        requests. This Statement requires data subjects
                                                                        to:

(5) Special notes
a. Only legal guardians or legally authorized persons have the right to access the personal data of others.
b. Most laws/regulations specify the circumstances under which an organization may not provide data to data subjects. These cases include scenarios when providing data may undermine ongoing efforts against terrorism; when the data subject has made repeated requests, or when obtaining and providing such information would consume disproportionate resources.
c. Typically, we will not provide the following information:
(a) Information about others: Requests from data subjects may involve other individuals besides the data subject. We will not provide such information, unless authorized by the relevant individuals.
(b) Repeated requests: If the data subject initiates the same or similar requests related to one data subject for multiple times, and the data has not changed since the last time we provided the data, we will not provide a copy of the data in most cases. Additionally, we have no obligation to provide information that has been publicly available.
(c) Confidential opinions: We are not obligated to provide the requested information if such information is a confidential opinion.
(d) Special documents: We will not disclose any special information in response to requests for accessing personal data. Typically, special information includes any confidential documents (such as attorney/client communication), and information that obtains or expresses a corresponding legal opinion (irrespective of whether it is related to the lawsuit itself or related to information from court proceedings).

We treat anyone under the age of 14 (or the age stipulated by local laws) as a child. Children are not allowed to create their own HUAWEI IDs without the consent of their parents or other guardians.

If the guardian needs to access, correct, or delete the personal data of the person under guardianship at any time, please contact us according to Chapter 10 "How to Contact Us." If we find that we have collected children's personal data without obtaining the prior consent from authenticated parents or other guardians, we will manage to delete the data as soon as possible.
