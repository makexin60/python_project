Information We Collect, How It Is Used, & The Legal Basis for Processing
Account Information
. We collect your email address and phone number to create an account and verify your identity. We also create a user ID for your Poe account. If you are an existing Quora user, your name, Quora-associated email address, profile photo, and Quora user ID will be used to link your Quora account to your Poe account. Depending on your location we may also ask you to provide your date of birth to verify your age. We use this information to communicate with you, troubleshoot issues, and provide updates on the latest Poe features. This processing is necessary to comply with our legal and contractual obligations to you.
Contact List
. With your consent, Poe may access and periodically sync your phone’s contact list to make it easy for you to find and connect with your friends on Poe. It is in our legitimate business interests to provide you with a customized experience.
Device Information
. We collect your device type and operating system details for analytics and to troubleshoot product issues. This is so we can comply with our contractual obligations to you.
Third Party Application Login
. You can log into your Poe account using third party applications (e.g., Google and Apple). When you log in using this method, we collect your name and email address associated with that third party application for authentication and identity verification purposes. This processing is necessary to comply with our contractual obligations to you.
Subscription Billing Data
. We use a third party service provider to collect and process your billing information when you subscribe to Poe. The information our billing provider collects may include your name, billing address, your credit or debit card details, phone number, and email address. This processing is necessary to comply with our contractual obligations to you.
Content Creator Payments.
If you are a content creator on Poe we collect and share your email with our third party payment processor to help facilitate payments to you. We also collect and share your tax information, such as your tax ID and address, with our tax service provider. This processing is necessary to comply with our legal and contractual obligations to you.
Advertising

It is in our legitimate business interest to advertise our platform. Where necessary, we will obtain your consent before engaging in this processing.
User Research
. We may ask you to help us test new features or participate in surveys to help enhance your Poe experience. Your participation is voluntary and the data we collect is anonymized. With your consent, we may use your personal information to communicate with you. It is in our legitimate business interest to improve our platform.
Interactions with Bots on Poe
. Our third party AI model LLM providers and third party bot developers may receive details about your interactions with bots on Poe (including the contents of your chats) to provide and generally improve their services, which they may process in their legitimate business interests. Your Poe user account information (e.g., username and email) is not shared with our third party AI model providers or developers. Third party developers that create bots on Poe using APIs may view and store your anonymized chats on their servers to train their models. We may use your interactions on Poe to provide you a personalized experience, such as recommending other bots to explore or topics to discuss.
Keep in mind, any information and files you provide to the bots on Poe will be shared with third party AI model providers and developers powering the bots, and there is no need to share sensitive personal information with the bots (e.g., credit card information, social security information, etc.). For more information about the third party AI model providers and bot developers, please see the respective bot profiles and visit the

You have questions, we have answers – FAQs
What personal data does Poe collect?
We collect information such as your name, email address, and IP address to create your Poe account. Please visit the
Poe Privacy Policy
to learn more.
Can other Poe users see my chats?
No, other users can’t read your chats with bots on Poe unless you explicitly decide to share them.
What does “anonymized” chats mean?
The personal data associated with your Poe account (e.g. name and email) is not sent to our AI model providers – in other words, they do not know who you are when they receive the contents of your chats.
Are my chats shared with third parties?
We share the contents of your anonymized chats with AI model providers that power the bots on Poe. This includes OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta. Although we take steps to help keep your identity private, any personal data you include in your chats with the bots is shared with the AI model providers (remember, there is no need to share sensitive information, such as your credit card number, with the bots).
Learn which AI model provider powers the bot you’re interacting with by clicking the bot’s info card.
Are my chats used to train the AI models?
In the vast majority of cases, no. Only third-party developer bots are permitted to use your chats to train their models. You can check the bot’s privacy shield icon to find out what type of bot it is.
Official Poe bots and user-created prompt bots using Open AI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta’s AI models do
not
train on your chats and cannot access your chats for anything other than to produce the requested LLM response
Third-party developer bots can use your anonymized chats to train their AI models – even then, they don’t have access to the personal data associated with your Poe account
What happens when I delete my chats? How about when I delete my Poe account?
Your chats and personal data associated with your account are deleted from Poe’s systems and will not be used for any other purpose. Visit the
Poe Help Center
to learn how to find these settings.
How long do your AI model provider partners retain my chats for?
Our partners receive anonymized versions of your chats and each partner sets their own retention schedule (e.g. OpenAI and Anthropic retain your chats for 30 days). Please reach out to the AI model provider directly to learn more.
