Right of access
You have the right to request information on the personal data we hold about you from us at any time. This information includes, but is not limited to, the categories of personal data we process, the purposes for which it is processed, the source of the data if not collected directly from you, and, if applicable, the recipients with whom we have shared your data.

Right to erasure

To the extent that the required information is reasonably available to us, and you do not otherwise have access to the required information, we will provide reasonable assistance to you with any data protection impact assessments, and prior consultations with supervisory authorities  (for example, the French Data Protection Agency (CNIL), the Berlin Data Protection Authority (BlnBDI) and the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)) or other competent data privacy authorities to the extent required by European Data Protection Laws.
Transfer Mechanisms for Data Transfers.
(A) HubSpot will not transfer European Data to any country or recipient not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data (within the meaning of applicable European Data Protection Laws), unless it first takes all such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with applicable European Data Protection Laws. Such measures may include (without limitation) transferring such data to a recipient that is covered by a suitable framework or other legally adequate transfer mechanism recognized by the relevant authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data, to a recipient that has achieved binding corporate rules authorization in accordance with European Data Protection Laws, or to a recipient that has executed appropriate standard contractual clauses in each case as adopted or approved in accordance with applicable European Data Protection Laws.
(B) You acknowledge that in connection with the performance of the Subscription Services, HubSpot, Inc. is a recipient of European Data in the United States. Subject to sub-sections (C) and (D), the parties agree that the Standard Contractual Clauses will be incorporated by reference and form part of the Agreement as follows:
(a) EEA Transfers. In relation to European Data that is subject to the GDPR (i) Customer is the "data exporter" and HubSpot, Inc. is the "data importer"; (ii) the Module Two terms apply to the extent the Customer is a Controller of European Data and the Module Three terms apply to the extent the Customer is a Processor of European Data; (iii) in Clause 7, the optional docking clause applies; (iv) in Clause 9, Option 2 applies and changes to Sub-Processors will be notified in accordance with the ‘Sub-Processors’ section of this DPA; (v) in Clause 11, the optional language is deleted; (vi) in Clauses 17 and 18, the parties agree that the governing law and forum for disputes for the Standard Contractual Clauses will be determined in accordance with the 'Contracting Entity; Applicable Law; Notice’ section of the Jurisdiction Specific Terms or, if such section does not specify an EU Member State, the Republic of Ireland (without reference to conflicts of law principles); (vii) the Annexes of the Standard Contractual Clauses will be deemed completed with the information set out in the Annexes of this DPA; and (viii) if and to the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses conflict with any provision of this DPA the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail to the extent of such conflict.
(b) UK Transfers. In relation to European Data that is subject to the UK GDPR, the Standard Contractual Clauses will apply in accordance with sub-section (a) and the following modifications (i) the Standard Contractual Clauses will be modified and interpreted in accordance with the UK Addendum, which will be incorporated by reference and form an integral part of the Agreement; (ii) Tables 1, 2 and 3 of the UK Addendum will be deemed completed with the information set out in the Annexes of this DPA and Table 4 will be deemed completed by selecting “neither party”; and (iii) any conflict between the terms of the Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK Addendum will be resolved in accordance with Section 10 and Section 11 of the UK Addendum.
(c) Swiss Transfers. In relation to European Data that is subject to the Swiss DPA, the Standard Contractual Clauses will apply in accordance with sub-section (a) and the following modifications (i) references to "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" will be interpreted as references to the Swiss DPA; (ii) references to "EU", "Union" and "Member State law" will be interpreted as references to Swiss law; and (iii) references to the "competent supervisory authority" and "competent courts" will be replaced with the "the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner " and the "relevant courts in Switzerland".
(C) Where the HubSpot contracting entity under the Agreement is not HubSpot, Inc., such contracting entity (not HubSpot, Inc.) will remain fully and solely responsible and liable to you for the performance of the Standard Contractual Clauses by HubSpot, Inc., and you will direct any instructions, claims or enquiries in relation to the Standard Contractual Clauses to such contracting entity. If HubSpot cannot comply with its obligations under the Standard Contractual Clauses or is breach of any warranties under the Standard Contractual Clauses or UK Addendum (as applicable) for any reason, and you intend to suspend the transfer of European Data to HubSpot or terminate the Standard Contractual Clauses ,or UK Addendum, you agree to provide us with reasonable notice to enable us to cure such non-compliance and reasonably cooperate with us to identify what additional safeguards, if any, may be implemented to remedy such non-compliance. If we have not or cannot cure the non-compliance, you may suspend or terminate the affected part of the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees you have incurred prior to such suspension or termination).
(D) Although HubSpot, Inc. does not currently rely on the EU-US Privacy Shield as a legal basis for transfers of European Data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18, for as long as HubSpot, Inc. is self-certified to the Privacy Shield HubSpot Inc will process European Data in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles and let you know if it is unable to comply with this requirement. In the event that HubSpot adopts an alternative transfer mechanism (including any new or successor version of the EU-US Privacy Shield) for transfers of European Data to HubSpot, Inc., such alternative transfer mechanism will apply automatically instead of the Standard Contractual Clauses described in this DPA (but only to the extent such alternative transfer mechanism complies with European Data Protection Laws), and you agree to execute such other documents or take such action as may be reasonably necessary to give legal effect such alternative transfer mechanism.

Annex 2 - Security Measures
We currently observe the Security Measures described in this Annex 2. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings as set forth in the
General Terms
.  For more information on these security measures, please refer to HubSpot’s SOC 2 Type II Report, SOC 3 Report, Security Overview and Penetration Test Summaries, available at
trust.hubspot.com
.
a) Access Control
i)  Preventing Unauthorized Product Access
Outsourced processing: We host our Service with outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. Additionally, we maintain contractual relationships with vendors in order to provide the Service in accordance with our DPA. We rely on contractual agreements, privacy policies, and vendor compliance programs in order to protect data processed or stored by these vendors.
Physical and environmental security: We host our product infrastructure with multi-tenant, outsourced infrastructure providers. We do not own or maintain hardware located at the outsourced infrastructure providers’ data centers. Production servers and client-facing applications are logically and physically secured from our internal corporate information systems. The physical and environmental security controls are audited for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance, among other certifications.
Authentication: We implement a uniform password policy for our customer products. Customers who interact with the products via the user interface must authenticate before accessing non-public customer data.
Authorization: Customer Data is stored in multi-tenant storage systems accessible to Customers via only application user interfaces and application programming interfaces. Customers are not allowed direct access to the underlying application infrastructure. The authorization model in each of our products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant features, views, and customization options. Authorization to data sets is performed through validating the user’s permissions against the attributes associated with each data set.
Application Programming Interface (API) access: Public product APIs may be accessed using an API key or through Oauth authorization.
ii)  Preventing Unauthorized Product Use
We implement industry standard access controls and detection capabilities for the internal networks that support its products.
Access controls: Network access control mechanisms are designed to prevent network traffic using unauthorized protocols from reaching the product infrastructure. The technical measures implemented differ between infrastructure  providers and include Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) implementations, security group assignment, and traditional firewall rules.
Intrusion detection and prevention: We implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution to protect hosted customer websites and other internet-accessible applications. The WAF is designed to identify and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.
Static code analysis: Code stored in our source code repositories  is checked for best practices and identifiable software flaws using automated tooling.
Penetration testing: We maintain relationships with industry-recognized penetration testing service providers for penetration testing of both the HubSpot web application and internal corporate network infrastructure at least annually. The intent of these penetration tests is to identify security vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk and business impact they pose to the in-scope systems.
Bug bounty: A bug bounty program invites and incentivizes independent security researchers to ethically discover and disclose security flaws. We implement a bug bounty program in an effort to widen the available opportunities to engage with the security community and improve the product defenses against sophisticated attacks.
iii)    Limitations of Privilege & Authorization Requirements
Product access: A subset of our employees have access to the products and to customer data via controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a subset of employees is to provide effective customer support, product development and research, to troubleshoot potential problems, to detect and respond to security incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through “just in time” (JITA) requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated daily. Administrative or high risk access permissions are reviewed at least once every six months.
Background checks: Where permitted by applicable law,  HubSpot employees undergo a third-party background or reference checks. In the United States, employment offers are contingent upon the results of a third-party background check. All HubSpot employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.
b) Transmission Control
In-transit: We require HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS)  on all login interfaces and for free on every customer site hosted on the HubSpot products. Our HTTPS implementation uses industry standard algorithms and certificates.
At-rest: We store user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for security.  We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest.
c) Input Control
Detection: We designed our infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior, traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregate log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. Our personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.
Response and tracking: We maintain a record of known security incidents that includes description, dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, we will take appropriate steps to minimize product and Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to you will be in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
d) Availability Control
Infrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a minimum of 99.95% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power, network, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) services.
Fault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over protections during a significant processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.
Online replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained using at least industry standard methods.
Disaster Recovery Plans: We maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans to help ensure availability of information following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.
Our products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless failover. The server instances that support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This design assists our operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and backend while limiting downtime.
Annex 3 - Sub-Processors
To help HubSpot deliver the Subscription Service, we engage Sub-Processors to assist with our data processing activities. A list of our Sub-Processors and our purpose for engaging them is located on our HubSpot Sub-Processors Page available at
