DATA USE AND PRIVACY POLICY for MyShiftPlanner Mobile App
Last Updated: 1st November 2022
Thank you for downloading MyShiftPlanner!
MyBuzz Technologies Ltd, the owners of MyShiftPlanner, are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy when you use our products and services.
This is our privacy policy and it explains:
what personal data we collect from you when you use MyShiftPlanner and related services
how we keep your data secure
how you can contact us
how to delete your account and all stored data about you
The purpose of the app is to provide a personal shift planning tool to help you manage your work and personal life more easily. The nature of this means that you may wish to input personal information into the app to allow you to gain most benefit from it.
The basic services provided by MyShiftPlanner do NOT require you to input personally identifiable data.
Entering this information is completely your choice, and if provided, will be used by the app to provide a better quality or tailored experience to you.
There are OPTIONAL “add-on” services you can choose to use, some of which require you to provide personal details such as an email address, in order to use. These are clearly marked within the app, and also described in more detail within this document.
It is your choice whether you wish to provide this information, and therefore whether you will be able to purchase or use this add-on.
If you choose to use our Service or app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.
The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service.
We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The Data Controller determines the purpose and means of processing personal data collected by the MyShiftPlanner app and services. The Data Controller is:
MyBuzz Technologies Ltd
Beehive Lofts
Manchester
M4 6JG
support@mybuzztechnologies.co.uk
Please contact the data controller if you have any questions or concerns about the data we collect about you.
BASIC INFORMATION COLLECTION AND HOW WE USE IT
Within the basic app, you can optionally provide the following personal information:
Your first and/or last name
Your profession
Your country (in which you are using the app)
Your location of work
Your employee ID
Name of your employer/place of work
Unless you choose to use the CLOUD-BASED services (as described below), all of this information is stored ONLY on the device.
Note – if you use a backup system such as iCloud or Google Drive to backup your device, this information may also be stored on these backup services as part of your device backup data. We have no control over these backups, where or how these files are stored and protected so can’t be held responsible for any misuse, loss or leak of these files from these locations.
The above information is used to provide a better user experience, such as providing the correct Public Holidays for your country on the calendar. Should you choose not to provide them, the app will continue to function but may show incomplete or incorrect information to you.
ADVERTISING
The free version of our app displays advertisements. This provides revenue to us which funds the continued development, support and maintenance of the app.
For advertising services, we use Google AdMob which provides the adverts from themselves and selected advertising partners. These adverts are shown at different places within the free version of the app, such as at the bottom of the screen.
We also provide access to certain Pro features in return for viewing adverts provided through Google AdMob.
Google advertisements will not be shown if you have purchased a relevant product from us, such as the Pro Pack or No Ads/Remove Ads add-on within the app.
Note: temporary or trial access to a feature granted by watching an advert does NOT constitute a purchase, so won’t stop adverts from being shown within the app.
Our advertising partners may optionally use data from your phone, purchase or web history to personalise the adverts shown to you. Specifically, they may collect:
Previous search activity
Your activity while you were signed in to Google
Your previous interactions with ads
Types of websites you visit
Types of mobile app activity on your device
Your activity on another device
The time of day
Info you gave to an advertiser, like if you signed up for a newsletter with your email address
WE DO NOT COLLECT OR HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION ourselves. It is collected directly and automatically by Google from your device using official APIs. We accept no responsibilities for any misuse, loss or leak of this data by Google.
YOU CAN OPT OUT OF SEEING PERSONALISED ADS. This can be done through your device “Settings” app as described below. If opted out, you will see more general ads instead which may be less relevant to you.
NOTE: Opting out of seeing personalised ads will NOT remove ads from MyShiftPlanner, it will simply show less relevant ads. You can only remove ads by purchasing the “Remove Ads” feature or the “Pro Pack”.
To find out more about what Google and their advertising partners collect and how they use your data, please see this link:
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
TO TURN OFF PERSONALISED ADS/AD TRACKING
This is different for iOS and Android but in general:
Open the Settings app on your device
Under Privacy > Advertising (Android) or Privacy & Security > Tracking, turn on/off  the option to “Limit Ad Tracking” or alternatively Privacy > Advanced > Ads and Opt Out of Ads Personisation (depending on the type of device you have).
For more detailed information about advertising and how it’s used, please see the more detailed section at the bottom of this document.
If you have any questions about this, please contain our team at: support@myshiftplanner.com
YOUR MYSHIFTPLANNER CLOUD ACCOUNT
We offer the ability to create a free MyShiftPlanner Cloud account (Account), through which a number of our OPTIONAL services are offered. To register for a MyShiftPlanner Cloud Account, we requiring the following information to be provided:
A valid email address (used as the user ID for your account and must be unique)
A strong password meeting our security rules (6 or more characters, with at least one capital letter and a number or symbol such as ?!.# or space)

If you prefer NOT to have this information stored on your MyShiftPlanner Cloud account, please DO NOT register for an account, or leave the information blank within your app.
If you choose to use the on-line Backup facilities of your MyShiftPlanner Account, your entire database from the app will be sent (securely) to our services, where they will be stored according to our data retention policy.
The Live Sharing feature of the PRO Pack require a MyShiftPlanner cloud account. If you prefer not to register for a MyShiftPlanner account, please check that the PRO Pack features still provide sufficient value without these features.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT DURING SUPPORT CASES:
If you choose to contact our support teams through the app or directly via Email, Facebook, Twitter or Instragram, we will retain your direct contact details and information provided to us about the support incident within our support systems. This data may also include a copy of your app log files and/or data files if you choose to include them at the time you submit the support ticket.
While the incident is on-going, we will use the provided contact details to contact you about the incident, and may use any provided data files to help us reproduce the issues you’re having in order to help solve your problems.
If we have difficulty contacting you during a support incident raised by you, we may use alternate contact details such as alternate email addresses within your account to contact you.
Any details provided during an incident will ONLY be used for that incident, and will never be used for any other purpose – such as sales or marketing.
If you prefer us not to use your data files during an incident, please let us know as soon as possible or remove the files from the generated email before sending to us.
There is a clear option within the Help/Support form in the app which allows you not to include your data files should you prefer not to.
Note: if you choose not to send your data files, it may restrict the amount of support we can provide or severely lengthen the time it takes us to resolve your issue.
PURCHASES and PURCHASE TRACKING
All purchases are made on our behalf through the App Store as appropriate for the device you purchase from. The App Store providers take, process and manage all purchases and money transfers on our behalf. We DO NOT store any credit card or personal purchase information, nor are we able to take payments without your explicit approval through the purchase process. You are required to instigate all purchases, which often need your physical approval via fingerprint, face detection or other security measure employed by the App Store provider.
The App Store owner may choose to keep personal data about you in accordance with their privacy policies, data use policies or terms in order to provide you with the services. Please refer to the relevant app store provider’s policies for more information.
We will NEVER automatically sign you up for a chargeable subscription, add-on or product. The default mode of the App is the free tier with advertisements.

If you wish to cancel any purchases, you must contact the relevant App Store operator as we have no access to your transaction information. We will happily assist you in finding the correct contact details if you wish to do this.
If you wish to see all purchases made within MyShiftPlanner, there is a Purchase History screen within the “Add More Features” option within the menu of the app that will allow you to access this at any time. This screen also includes a convenient link to the App Store purchase area where you can see even more details about your purchases and cancel or change subscription at any time.
We store information about your purchases on our servers in order to provide the appropriate features and services relevant to your purchases. This information includes:
Date and time of purchase
Type of product purchased
Expiry Date
Cancellation Date and Reason
Subscription or Purchase Status

If purchases are cancelled or subscriptions expire, the relevant features or services will be remove from your App or Account in accordance with our Terms and Conditions.

THIRD PARTY LINKS AND ADVERTISMENTS:
We display banner advertisements within MyShiftPlanner unless you have purchased the optional “No Ads” or one of the “Pro” feature pack within MyShiftPlanner. The free version of the app will always show adverts.
Advertisements are provided by Google AdMob network, and fully controlled, validated and monitored by Google as appropriate.
On iOS, when you first install the app it will ask you whether you wish to see
personalised ads
or not.
If you choose to allow these, you will see adverts which have been tailored to your location (country), past purchases and on-line activities as collected by Google and other providers during your use of your phone or the Internet.
If you choose
NOT
to allow personalised adverts, you will still see adverts within the app but they will NOT be tailored to you, so may not be of interest or relevance.
We do NOT provide any of your personal data to Google for tracking or advertising purpose. If personalised ads are allowed by you, Adverts are provided by Google without our involvement using data they have already collected about you from elsewhere.
When requesting a new advertisement, we send across the Ad Tracker ID from your device so that Google/Facebook can offer better tailored adverts that you may be interested in based on other information they may have collected from other apps or your internet usage on the same device.
If you do not want your Tracker ID to be sent to these third parties, you can opt NOT to allow Personalised Ads (iOS only) or turn this off within the Settings of your device.
For iOS, this setting is here (at the time of writing this policy):
For iOS 15 or later:
Open the Settings app on your phone or iPad
Tap “Privacy and Security”
Tap “Tracking”
Find MyShiftPlanner in the list of apps and turn off the switch.
For earlier iOS versions:
Open the Settings app on your phone or iPad
Tap “Privacy”
Scroll to the bottom and tap “Advertising”
Turn ON the “Limit Ad Tracking” option. This will stop MyShiftPlanner and all other apps on your device from using your Ad Tracking Id
For Android, this setting is here (at the time of writing this policy):
Open the Settings app on your device
Tap on the Google Services option
Tap on “Ads” under the “Services” section
Turn ON the option for “Opt out of Ads Personalization”
Note: As there are so many Android devices with different user interfaces, the above may not be accurate for your device. For advice for your specific device, please contact your device provider, or contact us for assistance.
Interacting with the advertisements (e.g. tapping on one) may open the ad providers website or a site outside of MyShiftPlanner.
These external sites are not operated by us and we cannot be held responsible for them. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites before continuing to use them or before providing them with any personal data. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Any issues with those third party services must be raised directly with the third party.
If you have concerns about any particular advertisement, or wish not to see them, tap on the triangular icon in the top-right corner of the advertisement for options on how to report this ad directly to Google.

In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.

The ads which show in our app are tailored for the intended audience of shift workers aged 16 or older. We actively block the most sensitive categories of ads (such as anything sexual or illegal) as far as we are able through the tools provided to us by the ad providers.

Entering this information is completely your choice, and if provided, will be used by the app to provide a better quality or tailored experience to you.
There are OPTIONAL “add-on” services you can choose to use, some of which require you to provide personal details such as an email address, in order to use. These are clearly marked within the app, and also described in more detail within this document.
It is your choice whether you wish to provide this information, and therefore whether you will be able to purchase or use this add-on.
If you choose to use our Service or app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.
The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service.
We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

ADVERTISING
The free version of our app displays advertisements. This provides revenue to us which funds the continued development, support and maintenance of the app.
For advertising services, we use Google AdMob which provides the adverts from themselves and selected advertising partners. These adverts are shown at different places within the free version of the app, such as at the bottom of the screen.
We also provide access to certain Pro features in return for viewing adverts provided through Google AdMob.
Google advertisements will not be shown if you have purchased a relevant product from us, such as the Pro Pack or No Ads/Remove Ads add-on within the app.
Note: temporary or trial access to a feature granted by watching an advert does NOT constitute a purchase, so won’t stop adverts from being shown within the app.
Our advertising partners may optionally use data from your phone, purchase or web history to personalise the adverts shown to you. Specifically, they may collect:
Previous search activity
Your activity while you were signed in to Google
Your previous interactions with ads
Types of websites you visit
Types of mobile app activity on your device
Your activity on another device
The time of day
Info you gave to an advertiser, like if you signed up for a newsletter with your email address
WE DO NOT COLLECT OR HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION ourselves. It is collected directly and automatically by Google from your device using official APIs. We accept no responsibilities for any misuse, loss or leak of this data by Google.
YOU CAN OPT OUT OF SEEING PERSONALISED ADS. This can be done through your device “Settings” app as described below. If opted out, you will see more general ads instead which may be less relevant to you.
NOTE: Opting out of seeing personalised ads will NOT remove ads from MyShiftPlanner, it will simply show less relevant ads. You can only remove ads by purchasing the “Remove Ads” feature or the “Pro Pack”.

THIRD PARTY LINKS AND ADVERTISMENTS:
We display banner advertisements within MyShiftPlanner unless you have purchased the optional “No Ads” or one of the “Pro” feature pack within MyShiftPlanner. The free version of the app will always show adverts.
Advertisements are provided by Google AdMob network, and fully controlled, validated and monitored by Google as appropriate.
On iOS, when you first install the app it will ask you whether you wish to see
personalised ads
or not.
If you choose to allow these, you will see adverts which have been tailored to your location (country), past purchases and on-line activities as collected by Google and other providers during your use of your phone or the Internet.
If you choose
NOT
to allow personalised adverts, you will still see adverts within the app but they will NOT be tailored to you, so may not be of interest or relevance.
We do NOT provide any of your personal data to Google for tracking or advertising purpose. If personalised ads are allowed by you, Adverts are provided by Google without our involvement using data they have already collected about you from elsewhere.
When requesting a new advertisement, we send across the Ad Tracker ID from your device so that Google/Facebook can offer better tailored adverts that you may be interested in based on other information they may have collected from other apps or your internet usage on the same device.
If you do not want your Tracker ID to be sent to these third parties, you can opt NOT to allow Personalised Ads (iOS only) or turn this off within the Settings of your device.
For iOS, this setting is here (at the time of writing this policy):
For iOS 15 or later:
Open the Settings app on your phone or iPad
Tap “Privacy and Security”
Tap “Tracking”
Find MyShiftPlanner in the list of apps and turn off the switch.
For earlier iOS versions:
Open the Settings app on your phone or iPad
Tap “Privacy”
Scroll to the bottom and tap “Advertising”
Turn ON the “Limit Ad Tracking” option. This will stop MyShiftPlanner and all other apps on your device from using your Ad Tracking Id
For Android, this setting is here (at the time of writing this policy):
Open the Settings app on your device
Tap on the Google Services option
Tap on “Ads” under the “Services” section
Turn ON the option for “Opt out of Ads Personalization”
Note: As there are so many Android devices with different user interfaces, the above may not be accurate for your device. For advice for your specific device, please contact your device provider, or contact us for assistance.
Interacting with the advertisements (e.g. tapping on one) may open the ad providers website or a site outside of MyShiftPlanner.
These external sites are not operated by us and we cannot be held responsible for them. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites before continuing to use them or before providing them with any personal data. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Any issues with those third party services must be raised directly with the third party.
If you have concerns about any particular advertisement, or wish not to see them, tap on the triangular icon in the top-right corner of the advertisement for options on how to report this ad directly to Google.

This data may also include a copy of your app log files and/or data files if you choose to include them at the time you submit the support ticket.
While the incident is on-going, we will use the provided contact details to contact you about the incident, and may use any provided data files to help us reproduce the issues you’re having in order to help solve your problems.
If we have difficulty contacting you during a support incident raised by you, we may use alternate contact details such as alternate email addresses within your account to contact you.
Any details provided during an incident will ONLY be used for that incident, and will never be used for any other purpose – such as sales or marketing.
If you prefer us not to use your data files during an incident, please let us know as soon as possible or remove the files from the generated email before sending to us.
There is a clear option within the Help/Support form in the app which allows you not to include your data files should you prefer not to.
Note: if you choose not to send your data files, it may restrict the amount of support we can provide or severely lengthen the time it takes us to resolve your issue.
PURCHASES and PURCHASE TRACKING
All purchases are made on our behalf through the App Store as appropriate for the device you purchase from. The App Store providers take, process and manage all purchases and money transfers on our behalf. We DO NOT store any credit card or personal purchase information, nor are we able to take payments without your explicit approval through the purchase process. You are required to instigate all purchases, which often need your physical approval via fingerprint, face detection or other security measure employed by the App Store provider.
The App Store owner may choose to keep personal data about you in accordance with their privacy policies, data use policies or terms in order to provide you with the services. Please refer to the relevant app store provider’s policies for more information.
We will NEVER automatically sign you up for a chargeable subscription, add-on or product. The default mode of the App is the free tier with advertisements. You can optionally choose to purchase additional features through the purchase options within the app but these are your choice. If you wish to cancel any purchases, you must contact the relevant App Store operator as we have no access to your transaction information. We will happily assist you in finding the correct contact details if you wish to do this.
If you wish to see all purchases made within MyShiftPlanner, there is a Purchase History screen within the “Add More Features” option within the menu of the app that will allow you to access this at any time. This screen also includes a convenient link to the App Store purchase area where you can see even more details about your purchases and cancel or change subscription at any time.
We store information about your purchases on our servers in order to provide the appropriate features and services relevant to your purchases. This information includes:
Date and time of purchase
Type of product purchased
Expiry Date
Cancellation Date and Reason
Subscription or Purchase Status
A link to your MyShiftPlanner Cloud Account if logged in at the time or or subsequently following the purchase.
If purchases are cancelled or subscriptions expire, the relevant features or services will be remove from your App or Account in accordance with our Terms and Conditions.
Note: once purchase are cancelled by the provider, they are blocked by the provider so you will not be able to re-purchase them through the app in future.
MONITORING AND AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED DATA
We automatically collect anonymous usage information from your app to allow us to monitor for problems and security issues. We do this in order to be able to provide the shift scheduling service to you.
The data collected by our automatic monitoring systems includes:
Device Make and model of the device
Country where the app is being used
Language of your device and timezone
IP address (to detect hacking attempt or misuse)
Data and time that the app was opened (to determine number of active users on our platform)
Crash and error information raised by the app
Basic activity within the app so we can identify underused features or problems with the user experience within the app. These are collected anonymously so never tracked against an individual. The tracked activity includes:
Opening of screens within the app
Use of specific features within the app
Purchases
Error generated within the app which you may or may not see
This information does NOT contain anysensitive personal information or contact information, nor is it used for anything other than monitoring our service and to detect breaches or security issues.
None of the information collected (as described above) is used for marketing purposes, nor is it shared with any other party for marketing purposes.
We use a mix of third party and bespokely created services to collect this information, including:
Google Analytics
In-built App Store monitoring and error collection tools
Priorietory monitoring tools developed by MyBuzz Technologies Ltd.
If you would prefer this information not be collected from your device then please delete the app and cease using it immediately.
MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS
All data we collect, and that you provide, will never be sold or shared with third parties for marketing purposes.
If you have opted to receive information from us via the app, we may, from time to time, contact you with relevant MyShiftPlanner or shift related information we believe may be of interest. We will never contact you with irrelevant information.
One of our communications is for the Shift Thinking newsletter published by us. If you have opted in to receive communication from us, then we will send this to you when available. You can opt out of receiving this newsletter by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of this email, at which point we will remove you from the mailing list for the newsletter. Directly unsubscribing from the newsletter will NOT automatically opt you out of receiving other communications.
If you prefer not to be contacted by us at all, you can use the Marketing option in the User Profile section of the app to opt out, or contact our support team who will be happy to do this for you.
If you choose to contact our support team, we reserve the right to contact you regarding the support ticket in order to help resolve your issue, even if you have opted out of all other communications. This may include sending links to relevant articles, images or advice from trusted third parties as part of our assistance with the support incident.
HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR DATA
Your personal data, such as your backups and MyShiftPlanner Cloud account details, will be retained for as long as you are using the app and service. We will delete your data under the following situations:
Backups older than 12 months may be deleted
at our discretion to help control our data storage use.
Accounts not used within 6 months will be deleted
according to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law.
You choose to delete your account
or request we do so for you.
Due to the nature of Mobile Apps and the App Stores, we aren’t informed and therefore will not be aware if you delete the app or discontinue using it. Please inform us directly if you have decided to stop using the app and wish your data to be removed. We will actively prune our database of accounts or backups that are perceived to be orphaned (not used) for at least 6 months.
Anonymised data collected for monitoring and security purposes will be retained for at least 12 months in order to allow us to provide historical evidence if required during any data breaches or security incidents.

THIRD PARTY LINKS AND ADVERTISMENTS:
We display banner advertisements within MyShiftPlanner unless you have purchased the optional “No Ads” or one of the “Pro” feature pack within MyShiftPlanner. The free version of the app will always show adverts.
Advertisements are provided by Google AdMob network, and fully controlled, validated and monitored by Google as appropriate.
On iOS, when you first install the app it will ask you whether you wish to see
personalised ads
or not.
If you choose to allow these, you will see adverts which have been tailored to your location (country), past purchases and on-line activities as collected by Google and other providers during your use of your phone or the Internet.
If you choose
NOT
to allow personalised adverts, you will still see adverts within the app but they will NOT be tailored to you, so may not be of interest or relevance.
We do NOT provide any of your personal data to Google for tracking or advertising purpose. If personalised ads are allowed by you, Adverts are provided by Google without our involvement using data they have already collected about you from elsewhere.
When requesting a new advertisement, we send across the Ad Tracker ID from your device so that Google/Facebook can offer better tailored adverts that you may be interested in based on other information they may have collected from other apps or your internet usage on the same device.
If you do not want your Tracker ID to be sent to these third parties, you can opt NOT to allow Personalised Ads (iOS only) or turn this off within the Settings of your device.
For iOS, this setting is here (at the time of writing this policy):
For iOS 15 or later:
Open the Settings app on your phone or iPad
Tap “Privacy and Security”
Tap “Tracking”
Find MyShiftPlanner in the list of apps and turn off the switch.
For earlier iOS versions:
Open the Settings app on your phone or iPad
Tap “Privacy”
Scroll to the bottom and tap “Advertising”
Turn ON the “Limit Ad Tracking” option. This will stop MyShiftPlanner and all other apps on your device from using your Ad Tracking Id
For Android, this setting is here (at the time of writing this policy):
Open the Settings app on your device
Tap on the Google Services option
Tap on “Ads” under the “Services” section
Turn ON the option for “Opt out of Ads Personalization”
Note: As there are so many Android devices with different user interfaces, the above may not be accurate for your device. For advice for your specific device, please contact your device provider, or contact us for assistance.
Interacting with the advertisements (e.g. tapping on one) may open the ad providers website or a site outside of MyShiftPlanner.
These external sites are not operated by us and we cannot be held responsible for them. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites before continuing to use them or before providing them with any personal data. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Any issues with those third party services must be raised directly with the third party.
If you have concerns about any particular advertisement, or wish not to see them, tap on the triangular icon in the top-right corner of the advertisement for options on how to report this ad directly to Google.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
MyShiftPlanner nor any of its related services are intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.
If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us as soon as possible.
The ads which show in our app are tailored for the intended audience of shift workers aged 16 or older. We actively block the most sensitive categories of ads (such as anything sexual or illegal) as far as we are able through the tools provided to us by the ad providers.
SUBJECT ACCESS REQUESTS
You may request, at any time, a disclosure of all information we hold about you, by contacting us at: support@myshiftplanner.com.

The report will be sent to you in a standard Microsoft Office compatible format, by email.
It is illegal for us to disclose to you information pertaining to us reporting our suspicions concerning your criminal behaviour or of ongoing criminal or regulatory investigations concerning your information.

Sub-policy 1
https://automattic.com/privacy/:
Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles:
We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.
Who We Are and What This Policy Covers
Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone — from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises — to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (“GPL”). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.
This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:
Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, atavist.com, mailpoet.com, automatewoo.com, jetpackcrm.com, happy.tools, wpcourses.com, wpscan.com, newspack.pub, and wp.cloud);
Our mobile applications (including the WordPress mobile app for Android and iOS);
Our other Automattic products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites (for example, WordPress.com plans, the Payments feature, the Pay with PayPal block, WordPress.com, Jetpack, Woo Shipping, Woo Tax, Gravatar, the IntenseDebate comment management system, Akismet plans, Simplenote, Simperium, Cloudup, Longreads, MailPoet, AutomateWoo, Jetpack CRM, Happy Tools, WordPress.com Courses, WPScan and Newspack); and
Other users’ websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us.
This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Automattic or one of our subsidiaries.
Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” And if you’d like to learn more about which Automattic company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on
Controllers and Responsible Companies
.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services, like Tumblr, that have a separate privacy policy.
Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.
Creative Commons Sharealike License
We’ve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a
Creative Commons Sharealike
license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on
GitHub
. You’re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we’d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.
Information We Collect
We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.
Information You Provide to Us
It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
Basic account information:
We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name — and that’s it. You may provide us with more information — like your address and other information you want to share — but we don’t require that information to create a WordPress.com account.
Public profile information:
If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
Payment and contact information:
There are various ways in which you may provide us payment information and associated contact information. For example, if you buy something from us or earn revenue through your site, we’ll collect information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us — a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a
custom domain
, some Longreads swag — or if you pay fees to a person or business through their WordPress.com site (for example via the Payments feature or the Pay with PayPal block), you’ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made. If you use our Ecommerce Services (including Woo Shipping, Woo Tax, and WooPayments), you’ll have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some Services, provide your site URL. You may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information. Additionally, if you use
WooPay
to make purchases on other sites, we will store the contact information and payment information you provide to that service. And if you participate in a revenue sharing opportunity for your site, like
WordAds
, you’ll provide some additional information — for example, a tax ID or other identifier so we can process payments to you.
Business Profile:
Some of our products collect additional information from you as part of creating a user/customer profile. For example, if you are a Jetpack CRM customer we may add you to our customer relationship database (powered by Jetpack CRM!) using information you provide us including your name, your employer, your job title or role, your contact information, and your communications with us. If you are a Happy Tools user, we use information you provide us like your timezone and location information, your company and team information, and your contact information, to set up your account and power the Service’s features.
Content information:
You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).
Credentials:
Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly.
Communications with us (hi there!):
You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).
Job applicant information:
If you apply for a job with us — awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, professional or personal references, similar professional and employment-related data, and work authorization verification as part of the application process. We may also collect additional information about you during the process, like background and credit checks (in applicable jurisdictions and only for certain job roles).  You may also provide us with demographic information when required by law or to support our diverse workplace initiatives, such as your gender, racial or ethnic origin, veteran status, and disability status if you voluntarily submit such information as part of your application. We collect demographic information in accordance with applicable law, and do not request demographic information in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited. We will only use this sensitive information to accommodate a disability or illness, comply with legal obligations, protect the health and safety of our employees, and facilitate our internal programs relating to diversity, inclusion, and anti-discrimination.
Information We Collect Automatically
We also collect some information automatically:
Log information:
Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.
Transactional information:
When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction. This includes when you purchase something we sell or when you use our Services (like
WooPay
) to buy something from a third party.
Usage information:
We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted “[title of post]” at [time/date]). Our
WooCommerce Usage Tracker
also tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, and PHP settings, along with information about your online store, like the aggregate number of orders and customers. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our
Admin Bar
and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.
Location information:
We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.
Stored information:
We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.
Interactions with other users’ sites:
We collect some information about your interactions with other users’ sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your “Likes” and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example,
recommend posts
we think may interest you. As another example, we collect information about the comments IntenseDebate users make while logged in and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and display information about your comments in your IntenseDebate public profile.
Information from cookies & other technologies:
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Information We Collect from Other Sources
We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:
Third Party Login:
If you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) we’ll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address)
Social Sharing Services:
If you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our
Publicize feature
, we’ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.
Financial Account Info
:
If you use WooPayments, we’ll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number. If you use WooPay, we’ll receive your payment information from Stripe.
Google Account Information:
When you connect your Google account to your Newspack powered site, we may access certain Google user data such as your Google Ad Manager Configuration (the network code and your ad units) and your Google Analytics data to allow you to access and manage features more seamlessly. For example, you may be able to manage your Google ads and see your Google Analytics data directly within the dashboard of your Newspack powered site.
The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.
Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.
How and Why We Use Information
Purposes for Using Information
We use information about you for the purposes listed below:
To provide our Services.
For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.
To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.
For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
To place and manage ads in our advertising program.
For example, to place ads on our users’ sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.
To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.
For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.
To protect our Services, our users, and the public.
For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
To fix problems with our Services.
For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
To customize the user experience.
For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.
To communicate with you.
For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Automattic; texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)
To recruit and hire new Automatticians.
For example, by evaluating job applicants (including verifying their identity, experience, and other information submitted) and communicating with them by phone, email, or social media platforms.  If the application progresses, we may also collect interview information and background check information.  This may also include verifying information required to initiate employment, for purposes such as confirming ability to legally work in a specific location, setting up payroll, and complying with statutory reporting requirements.
Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:
(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or
(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or
(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or
(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or
(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our
Cookie Policy
.
Sharing Information
How We Share Information
We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below, as well as in the section called
Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others
:
Subsidiaries and independent contractors:

We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.
Third-party vendors:
We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which powers WooPayments, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your own ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic); those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites (like the extensions on woocommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our
Cookie Policy
).
Legal and regulatory requirements:
We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our
Legal Guidelines
. Additionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers’ (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our
Domain Registrations and Privacy support document
for more details.
To protect rights, property, and others:
We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we
may disclose information related to the emergency without delay
.
Business transfers:
In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
With your consent:
We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.
Aggregated or de-identified information:
We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
Site owners:
If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with another site using our Services, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site. For example, if you leave a comment on a site created on WordPress.com or running Jetpack, your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment. Or if you make a payment (like via the
Payments feature
) to a site, your public display name, user name, and email address may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site. Or if you follow/subscribe to another WordPress.com site we will share your email address with the site owner.
Published support requests:
If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.
Information Shared Publicly
Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly.
That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your “Likes” and comments on other websites are all available to others — and we hope they get a lot of views!
For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven’t uploaded one, is your
G
lobally
R
ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar — get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and “Likes” that you make on other users’ websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Your Gravatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, “Likes,” and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account is the same email address you use on the other website.
We also provide a “Firehose” stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly. Find out more about opting out of the Firehose for
WordPress.com
and
Jetpack
sites. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.
How Long We Keep Information
We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it.
For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic’s websites, like the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automattic’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.
As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.
If you are a job applicant, we will keep your personal data during the application process, and for a certain period thereafter. To determine that period, we take into account a number of factors, like our legal and regulatory obligations (such as equal opportunity obligations) and whether we may need to retain personal data for internal business purposes like analyzing our applicant pool.
Security
While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like
Two Step Authentication
.
Choices
You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:
Limit the information that you provide:
If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services — for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge — may not be accessible. If you are a job applicant, and you choose not to provide certain data elements to us, we may not be able to proceed with the recruitment process.
Limit access to information on your mobile device:
Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for photographs.
Opt out of marketing communications:
You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
Set your browser to reject cookies:
At this time, Automattic does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can
usually choose
to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Opt out of our internal analytics program:
You can do this through your user settings. By opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you’re logged in to your WordPress.com account. For more information, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Close your account:
While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. (
Here
are account closure instructions for WordPress.com accounts.) Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
Your Rights
If you are located in certain parts of the world, including some US states and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:
Request access to your personal data;
Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
Request portability of your personal data.
You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.
US Privacy Laws
Laws in some US states require us to provide residents with additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. You’ll find that information in this section (if you are a California resident, please note that this is the Notice at Collection we are required to provide you under California law).
In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information, depending on the Services used:
Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us or you may choose to voluntarily disclose your race or veteran status as part of your job application);
Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);
Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application); and
Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).
If you are a job applicant, we may have also collected:
Education information, such as the education you disclose in your job application.
You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the
Information We Collect section
above.
We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the
How and Why We Use Information section
. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the
Sharing Information section
. We retain this information for the length of time described in our
How Long We Keep Information section
.
In some US states you have additional rights subject to any exemptions provided by your state’s respective law, including the right to:
Request a copy of the specific pieces of information we collect about you and, if you’re in California, to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, and the categories of third parties we share it with;
Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
Request correction of personal information we collect or maintain;
Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information;
Receive a copy of your information in a readily portable format; and
Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights.
You can find detailed metrics about Automattic’s compliance with these rights in
our Privacy Report
.
Right to Opt Out
We never directly sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).
We may share your information as necessary with our third-party service providers to provide our services to you. To the extent that we share your information with certain advertising, marketing, or analytics vendors, this can be considered a “sale” or “share” in certain U.S. States, which you may have the right to opt out of.
You can learn more about this sharing and how to opt out by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link in the footer of our websites, or from the settings page within our apps. Note that in some instances this link will only display to individuals visiting our sites from within the relevant states.
Our opt-out is managed through cookies, so if you delete cookies, your browser is set to delete cookies automatically after a certain length of time, or if you visit sites in a different browser, you’ll need to make this selection again.
We also respect the GPC browser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire to opt out.
We do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive) personal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with our service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option to limit under California law. We don’t knowingly sell or share personal information of those under 16.
Your Information & Personalized Advertising
Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible. We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites. As part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users’ sites and some of our own.
The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a “sale” or “share” of information under some US state privacy laws. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information. Learn how you can opt out by going to
Advertising on WordPress.com Sites and Sites in the WordAds Program
.
Contacting Us About These Rights
You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to “
How to Reach Us
” to, well, find out how to reach us.
When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.
Appeals Process for Rights Requests Denials
In some circumstances we may deny your request to exercise one of these rights. For example, if we cannot verify that you are the account owner we may deny your request to access the personal information associated with your account. As another example, if we are legally required to maintain a copy of your personal information we may deny your request to delete your personal information.
In the event that we deny your request, we will communicate this fact to you in writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial email and stating that you would like to appeal. All appeals will be reviewed by an internal expert who was not involved in your original request. In the event that your appeal is also denied this information will be communicated to you in writing.  Please note that the appeal process does not apply to job applicants.
If your appeal is denied, in some US states you may refer the denied appeal to the state attorney general if you believe the denial is in conflict with your legal rights. The process for how to do this will be communicated to you in writing at the same time we send you our decision about your appeal.
Controllers and Responsible Companies
Automattic’s Services are worldwide. Different Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.
Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data. Generally, the “controller” is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you under the Terms of Service for the product or service you use. In addition, Automattic Inc., our US-based company, is the controller for some of the processing activities across all of our Services worldwide.
The chart below explains the current controllers for processing your personal information. We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and all countries located in Europe (including the UK and ROI).

Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)
Transferring Information
Because Automattic’s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third-party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the
How and Why We Use Information section
above.
When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with entities based in countries outside the EEA.
You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.
Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others
Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver ads that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Automattic and does not cover the collection of information by any third-party advertisers or analytics providers.
Third-Party Software and Services
If you’d like to use third-party plugins or embeds, WooPayments (powered by Stripe), Woo extensions that enable services provided by third parties, or other third-party software or services, please keep in mind that interacting with them may mean providing information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties. For example, some third-party services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data via a pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third-party service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy and practices. We don’t own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about information collection, use, and sharing, which you should review before using the software or services.
Visitors to Our Users’ Websites
We also process information about visitors to our users’ websites, on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for their websites isn’t covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information. If you’d like, you can also read more about the data we collect on behalf of our users in our
Privacy Notice
.
Users control the content posted on their sites, so any disputes regarding content on a user’s site should be made directly to the site owner, through their “contact us” page, at an email address they provide, or by leaving a comment on the site.
Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Automattic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Automattic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our homepage or the
WordPress.com Blog,
or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
