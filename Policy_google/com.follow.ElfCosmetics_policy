Beauty Squad Loyalty Program, the Soulcare Rewards Loyalty Program,                 and exclusive offers and promotions via email. When you sign up for and participate in these programs,                 we may ask you to provide us with contact information and identifiers such as your name and email                 address, and commercial information such as your purchase history.

here

You may withdraw from our loyalty programs at                 any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable rules, such as by                 closing your account or opting out from our email and SMS communications.
Sale or Sharing of Personal Information
We do not sell your personal information for monetary compensation. However, like most online businesses,                 we share some information with advertisers, advertising publishers, and marketing service providers to                 serve you targeted advertising (including cross-device marketing or advertising campaigns (where we can                 infer that a particular browser, device, or pseudonymous identifier belongs to you)). These third                 parties may collect personal information via automated technologies on our websites for cross-context                 behavioral advertising purposes. This kind of sharing may be considered a "sale" of personal                 information under California law when the personal information is exchanged for non-monetary                 consideration.
We may sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes (and, during the 12-month period                 prior to the last update of this California Residents Privacy Addendum, we may have sold or shared) the                 following categories of personal information with these third parties:
email address, phone number, IP address and internet and electronic network activity including                     information regarding interactions with our website.
You have the right to opt out of this disclosure of your personal information. If you wish to request                 that we do not sell or share your personal information, please contact us using the contact information                 detailed in the
"
Exercising Your California Privacy                     Rights
"
section of this California Residents Privacy Addendum.
We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share personal information of individuals that are                 California residents under the age of 16.
Retention of Personal Information
We will retain your personal information for the time period reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes                 described in this Privacy Notice and California Residents Privacy Addendum, or any other notice provided                 at the time of collection, taking into account applicable statutes of limitation and records retention                 requirements under applicable law.

If you choose to exercise any of your rights under California law, we will not discriminate against you                 because you have exercised any of these rights.
Other California Privacy Rights
Shine the Light Requests
.
California law permits our consumers who are California residents to request certain information about                 our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes during                 the preceding calendar year. This request is free and can be made once a year using the contact                 information detailed in the
"
Exercising Your California                     Privacy Rights
"
section of this California Residents Privacy                 Addendum.
Online Eraser Law
.
If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with us, you have                 the right to request removal of unwanted information that you publicly post on the applicable website or                 mobile application. To request removal of such information, please contact us using the contact                 information detailed in the
"
Exercising Your California                     Privacy Rights
"
section of this California Residents Privacy                 Addendum, with details on where the information is posted. Upon receiving such a request, we will make                 reasonable good faith efforts to ensure that the information is not publicly available on the applicable                 website or mobile application, but the information will not be completely or comprehensively removed                 from our systems and databases.
Additional Information
Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators                 of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do                 not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different                 websites. Because there is no standard interpretation or practice for Do Not Track signals, like many                 websites, our website does not support Do Not Track requests at this time.
However, to opt-out of cookie and web beacon tracking, please see the
"
Withdrawing Your Consent for (Opting-Out of) Tracking                     Technologies
"
section of the Privacy Notice, or to opt-out of                 website-based third-party interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the "
Opting Out of Third-Party Tailored Advertising
"
section of the Privacy Notice.
EXERCISING YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
To make any of the requests or exercise any of your California privacy rights described above, please                 contact us using one of following methods. Please note that you can only make a verifiable request for                 access twice within a 12-month period.
You may access certain personal information by signing into your account for the relevant brand. From                 there, you can update, correct, or modify that personal information (other than your order                 history)—you will need to update, correct, or modify your personal information in each of your                 accounts with our brands as changes in one brand account will not automatically update your other brand                 accounts. Please note that deleting any personal information in your account will not completely delete                 that information from our systems—to request that we delete your personal information from our                 systems, you must follow the directions below.
If you wish to access any personal information that is not contained in your relevant brand account                 profile, if you do not have an account and wish to access your personal information, if you wish to                 otherwise request information from us about the information we collected about you over the past 12                 months, or if you wish to submit a deletion request, please contact us as detailed in the
"Contact Us"
section of this California Residents Privacy Addendum.
Please note that if you are a member of one of our loyalty programs and you request that your personal                 information is deleted, you will be removed from that particular brand loyalty program.

BONA FIDE LOYALTY PROGRAMS
We may offer you various financial incentives, such as discounts and special offers, when you sign up                 with one of our brand loyalty programs, including the e.l.f. Beauty Squad Loyalty Program, the Keys                 Soulcare Rewards, or the Naturium Consistency Club Loyalty Program. To enroll in our loyalty programs,                 you are required to provide us with your name, date of birth (except for the Naturium Consistency Club                 Loyalty Program) and email address and create an account password. Once you enroll in the applicable                 loyalty program, we will also collect information about purchases you may make.
In connection with our loyalty programs, you can receive benefits and financial incentives based on                 certain purchases and other activities. You can join our loyalty programs and find program details,                 terms and conditions on our participating websites. You may opt out of receiving such financial                 incentives at any time by deactivating your loyalty program account(s). To deactivate your loyalty                 program account(s), visit the specific website of the loyalty program you wish to deactivate and provide                 your information as requested.
The categories of personal information collected through our loyalty program that may be sold or                 processed for targeted advertising include identifiers (such as your email address), Internet and other                 online activity information (such as IP address, browsing history and other information regarding your                 interactions with our websites), and commercial information (such as your order history and wish lists).
We may disclose personal information we collect through our loyalty programs to third parties such as                 service providers, data analytics providers, our corporate affiliates, and advertising networks. We do                 not provide the personal information we collect through our loyalty programs to data brokers, as defined                 by the Colorado Privacy Act.
If you exercise your right to request deletion of your personal information, it may be impossible for us                 to continue providing loyalty program benefits to you because we will no longer have the information                 required to provide you with certain benefits (such as information about qualifying purchases).

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS OUT OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
IMPORTANT: Your personal information will be sent to the United States and possibly other                         countries.
Our websites are hosted in the United States. If you are visiting one of our websites from outside the                 United States, your personal information will be transferred to, stored in, or processed in, the United                 States and transferred to, stored in, or processed in additional countries where our third-party service                 providers maintain facilities or operations. These countries include the United Kingdom, Ireland, the                 Netherlands, and Germany.
Where we transfer, store, or process your personal information outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom:
we do so to the extent such transfer, storage, or processing is necessary to fulfil a contract                     between us (for example, to manage your participation in our loyalty program or to fulfill your                     order); or
we rely on other methods to ensure an adequate level of data protection:
Adequacy Decisions
: Some of our third-party service providers are based in                         countries that the European Commission and competent authorities in the United Kingdom have                         found to have adequate levels of protection for personal information; or
Standard Contractual Clauses
: We rely on the European Commission’s model                         contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries (i.e. the standard                         contractual clauses), and equivalent contracts issued by the relevant competent authority of the                         United Kingdom, when transferring personal information to our third-party service providers who                         are located in countries that the European Commission
and the
relevant                         competent authority of the United Kingdom as applicable have not found to have adequate levels                         of protection for personal information.
You can request a copy of the instruments we use by contacting us using the contact details provided in                 the
"Contact Us"
section of this EU/UK Privacy Addendum.
Please note that the data protection and other applicable laws of the United States or other countries                 may not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from                 the data protection laws in your country. Your personal information may be available to government                 authorities under lawful orders and law applicable in such jurisdictions.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
How long we retain your personal information depends on why and how we collected it and how we use it. We                 will keep your personal information for as long as we need it for the purposes described in this Privacy                 Notice and to meet our legal obligations as explained further below.
To determine the retention period of your personal information, we consider several criteria to make sure                 that we do not keep your personal information for longer than is necessary or appropriate. These                 criteria include:
the purpose for which we hold your personal information;

You may access certain personal                         information by signing into your account for the relevant brand. From there, you can update,                         correct, or modify that personal information (other than your order history)—you will need to                         update, correct, or modify your personal information in each of your accounts with our brands as                         changes in one brand account will not automatically update your other brand accounts.

If you (1) wish to access any personal information that is not contained in your relevant brand                         account profile, (2) do not have an account and wish to access your personal information, or (3)                         wish to submit a correction or deletion request or exercise another right described above,                         please submit your request by using the relevant Privacy Rights Request Form linked below,                         writing to us at the address provided in the “Contact Us” section, or calling us at (888)                         315-9814.

These third                 parties may collect personal information via automated technologies on our websites for cross-context                 behavioral advertising purposes. This kind of sharing may be considered a "sale" of personal                 information under California law when the personal information is exchanged for non-monetary                 consideration.
We may sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes (and, during the 12-month period                 prior to the last update of this California Residents Privacy Addendum, we may have sold or shared) the                 following categories of personal information with these third parties:
email address, phone number, IP address and internet and electronic network activity including                     information regarding interactions with our website.
You have the right to opt out of this disclosure of your personal information. If you wish to request                 that we do not sell or share your personal information, please contact us using the contact information                 detailed in the
"
Exercising Your California Privacy                     Rights
"
section of this California Residents Privacy Addendum.
We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share personal information of individuals that are                 California residents under the age of 16.
Retention of Personal Information
We will retain your personal information for the time period reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes                 described in this Privacy Notice and California Residents Privacy Addendum, or any other notice provided                 at the time of collection, taking into account applicable statutes of limitation and records retention                 requirements under applicable law.

This request is free and can be made once a year using the contact                 information detailed in the
"
Exercising Your California                     Privacy Rights

section of this California Residents Privacy                 Addendum.
Online Eraser Law
.
If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with us, you have                 the right to request removal of unwanted information that you publicly post on the applicable website or                 mobile application.

"
Exercising Your California                     Privacy Rights

Upon receiving such a request, we will make                 reasonable good faith efforts to ensure that the information is not publicly available on the applicable                 website or mobile application, but the information will not be completely or comprehensively removed                 from our systems and databases.
Additional Information
Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators                 of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do                 not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different                 websites. Because there is no standard interpretation or practice for Do Not Track signals, like many                 websites, our website does not support Do Not Track requests at this time.
However, to opt-out of cookie and web beacon tracking, please see the
"
Withdrawing Your Consent for (Opting-Out of) Tracking                     Technologies
"
section of the Privacy Notice, or to opt-out of                 website-based third-party interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the "
Opting Out of Third-Party Tailored Advertising

section of the Privacy Notice.
EXERCISING YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
To make any of the requests or exercise any of your California privacy rights described above, please                 contact us using one of following methods. Please note that you can only make a verifiable request for                 access twice within a 12-month period.
You may access certain personal information by signing into your account for the relevant brand. From                 there, you can update, correct, or modify that personal information (other than your order                 history)—you will need to update, correct, or modify your personal information in each of your                 accounts with our brands as changes in one brand account will not automatically update your other brand                 accounts. Please note that deleting any personal information in your account will not completely delete                 that information from our systems—to request that we delete your personal information from our                 systems, you must follow the directions below.
If you wish to access any personal information that is not contained in your relevant brand account                 profile, if you do not have an account and wish to access your personal information, if you wish to                 otherwise request information from us about the information we collected about you over the past 12                 months, or if you wish to submit a deletion request, please contact us as detailed in the
"Contact Us"
section of this California Residents Privacy Addendum.
Please note that if you are a member of one of our loyalty programs and you request that your personal                 information is deleted, you will be removed from that particular brand loyalty program.

How to Submit a Request
You may access certain personal information by signing into your account for the relevant brand. From                 there, you can update, correct, or modify that personal information (other than your order history)—you                 will need to update, correct, or modify your personal information in each of your accounts with our                 brands as changes in one brand account will not automatically update your other brand accounts. Please                 note that deleting any personal information in your account will not completely delete that information                 from our systems—to request that we delete your personal information from our systems, you must follow                 the directions below.

To enroll in our loyalty programs,                 you are required to provide us with your name, date of birth (except for the Naturium Consistency Club                 Loyalty Program) and email address and create an account password.

In connection with our loyalty programs, you can receive benefits and financial incentives based on                 certain purchases and other activities. You can join our loyalty programs and find program details,                 terms and conditions on our participating websites. You may opt out of receiving such financial                 incentives at any time by deactivating your loyalty program account(s). To deactivate your loyalty                 program account(s), visit the specific website of the loyalty program you wish to deactivate and provide                 your information as requested.
The categories of personal information collected through our loyalty program that may be sold or                 processed for targeted advertising include identifiers (such as your email address), Internet and other                 online activity information (such as IP address, browsing history and other information regarding your                 interactions with our websites), and commercial information (such as your order history and wish lists).

If you exercise your right to request deletion of your personal information, it may be impossible for us                 to continue providing loyalty program benefits to you because we will no longer have the information                 required to provide you with certain benefits (such as information about qualifying purchases).

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS OUT OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
IMPORTANT: Your personal information will be sent to the United States and possibly other                         countries.
Our websites are hosted in the United States. If you are visiting one of our websites from outside the                 United States, your personal information will be transferred to, stored in, or processed in, the United                 States and transferred to, stored in, or processed in additional countries where our third-party service                 providers maintain facilities or operations. These countries include the United Kingdom, Ireland, the                 Netherlands, and Germany.
Where we transfer, store, or process your personal information outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom:
we do so to the extent such transfer, storage, or processing is necessary to fulfil a contract                     between us (for example, to manage your participation in our loyalty program or to fulfill your                     order); or
we rely on other methods to ensure an adequate level of data protection:
Adequacy Decisions
: Some of our third-party service providers are based in                         countries that the European Commission and competent authorities in the United Kingdom have                         found to have adequate levels of protection for personal information; or
Standard Contractual Clauses
: We rely on the European Commission’s model                         contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries (i.e. the standard                         contractual clauses), and equivalent contracts issued by the relevant competent authority of the                         United Kingdom, when transferring personal information to our third-party service providers who                         are located in countries that the European Commission
and the
relevant                         competent authority of the United Kingdom as applicable have not found to have adequate levels                         of protection for personal information.
You can request a copy of the instruments we use by contacting us using the contact details provided in                 the
"Contact Us"
section of this EU/UK Privacy Addendum.
Please note that the data protection and other applicable laws of the United States or other countries                 may not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from                 the data protection laws in your country. Your personal information may be available to government                 authorities under lawful orders and law applicable in such jurisdictions.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
How long we retain your personal information depends on why and how we collected it and how we use it. We                 will keep your personal information for as long as we need it for the purposes described in this Privacy                 Notice and to meet our legal obligations as explained further below.
To determine the retention period of your personal information, we consider several criteria to make sure                 that we do not keep your personal information for longer than is necessary or appropriate. These                 criteria include:
the purpose for which we hold your personal information;
our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to that personal information, for example any                     financial reporting obligations or statutory retention obligations (for example, under commercial or                     tax law which usually last from seven years);
whether our relationship with you is ongoing;
any specific requests from you in relation to the deletion of your personal                     information; and
our legitimate business interests in relation to managing our own rights, for example                     the assertion or defense of any claims within the statutes of limitation.
When we no longer need to retain your personal information, it will be deleted or be anonymized so that                 you can no longer be identified from it.

Personal Information Transferred from EEA, UK and/or Switzerland
We may share your personal data with entities within the Cision Group. Given that we are an international organisation with our headquarters in the USA, this may involve transferring your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Some of the third parties to whom we transfer your personal data are also based outside of the EEA, so their processing of your personal data will likewise involve a transfer outside the EEA. Where your personal data is transferred outside of the EEA we will ensure that we appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure the protection of your personal information, including the use of specific contracts approved by the European Commission giving your personal data the same protection as it has in Europe.
Such transfers may be made by or to us in our capacity as a data processor or as a data controller:
Processor
: Cision is a provider of software, services and tools intended to help customers manage all aspects of their marketing and PR campaigns. Cision does not own or control any of the information it processes on behalf of its customer. All such information is owned and controlled by Cision’s customer. In this capacity, Cision receives information transferred from the EU to the US merely as a processor on behalf of its customer, although such information may not be required by Cision.
Data Controller
: Cision also provides information products designed to help customers research and plan their campaigns more effectively. In this function, Cision acts as a data controller of the personal information contained in these products and processes this personal information as a data controller.
Further details of transfers of personal data outside the EEA are provided in our
International Data Transfers
page.
Legal Basis for Processing
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
·        Where we need to process your information to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
·        Where we need to process your information to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
·        Where it is in our legitimate interests to do so.  Our legitimate interests include our legitimate commercial interests in operating the Cision Services and providing you with access to our Media Database. We make sure that we consider and balance any potential negative impact on you and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you.
·        Where we have obtained your consent.
Your rights
You have certain rights under data protection laws which include the right to:

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices

The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
