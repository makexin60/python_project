Use of Personal Data for the Primary Purpose will include the use of Personal Data in automated decision-making processes.
We will only use or disclose Personal Data about you for a purpose other than the Primary Purpose (being a "
Secondary Purpose

We have implemented security measures to protect the security of your Personal Data. However, as with any transfer of data, there are still risks of data breaches.

(f) Unsolicited information
If we collect Personal Data which we have not sought or requested about you, and if we determine we are legally permitted to collect that information, we will deal with that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement. In all other circumstances, we will destroy or de-identify the relevant Personal Data as soon as practicable, where it is lawful and reasonable to do so.

However, our deleting of your Personal Data may result in the deletion of your account and will mean you are unable to access our services.
If we correct or erase Personal Data about you that we previously disclosed to a third party in accordance with our Privacy Statement, we will take reasonable steps to notify the third party of the correction or erasure and to request that they do the same.
(g) Refusal to correct or erase
If at any time we refuse or deny you access to your Personal Data, or refuse to correct or erase your Personal Data, we will provide you with reasons for such denial or refusal.
(h) Restriction of processing
You may request that we limit or restrict the manner in which we deal with and process your Personal Data, in which case we will only process your Personal Data: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims against us; or for the protection of the rights of another person.

(j) Specific objection rights
If it becomes necessary for us to process your Personal Data without your consent for reasons of:
(i)
performing a task in the public interest;
(ii)
the exercise of an official authority that has been vested in us; or
(iii)
where it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party to do so;
you will have the right to object to such use.
If you object to our use of your Personal Data we will refrain from using your Personal Data unless compelling legitimate grounds exist for us to use that Personal Data, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
If we have collected your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and elect to use such Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing (to which you consent), you have the right to object at any time to such use.
