Privacy policy
We are Camino de Santiago Forum ("we", "our", "us"). Weâ€™re committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. If you have questions about your personal information please
contact us
.

You browse this site. See "Cookie policy" below.
You fill out fields on your profile.
How your personal information is used
We may use your personal information in the following ways:
For the purposes of making you a registered member of our site, in order for you to contribute content to this site.
We may use your email address to inform you of activity on our site.
Your IP address is recorded when you perform certain actions on our site. Your IP address is never publicly visible.
Other ways we may use your personal information.
In addition to notifying you of activity on our site which may be relevant to you, from time to time we may wish to communicate with all members any important information such as newsletters or announcements by email. You can opt-in to or opt-out of such emails in your profile.
We may collect non-personally identifiable information about you in the course of your interaction with our site. This information may include technical information about the browser or type of device you're using. This information will be used purely for the purposes of analytics and tracking the number of visitors to our site.
Keeping your data secure
We are committed to ensuring that any information you provide to us is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable measures and procedures to safeguard and secure the information that we collect.

contact us
to ask us to complete or correct that information.
You also have the right to request the erasure of your personal data. Please
contact us

Google and Facebook
The forum is trying to give away the minimum amount of information to both google and facebook. Here is what I have done to minimize this so far:
All e-mail to the forum is now not going to a Gmail account. The forum is now using protonmail as its mail server.
The forum is no longer using Google Analytics (for visitor statistics). We use an open source web stat package, and do not share our stats with anyone.
It is no longer possible to create a forum account by using your facebook or google account. This would share your activity on the forum with the respective company.
This following is what we still share with google and facebook:
We do use google adsense ads for non-donating users. If you
become a donating forum member
, you will not see any google ads and this will not apply to you.
We are setting the facebook pixel for users who are not logged in. This means that if you visit the forum (only if you are not logged in) I can show you ads on facebook for the Camino Forum Store. To avoid this, create a free forum account and log in.
Acceptance of this policy
Continued use of our site signifies your acceptance of this policy. If you do not accept the policy then please do not use this site. When registering we will further request your explicit acceptance of the privacy policy.
Changes to this policy
We may make changes to this policy at any time. You may be asked to review and re-accept the information in this policy if it changes in the future.
Analytics
We use the newest version of Google Analytics (Google Analytics 4), which is privacy-focused (things like IP addresses are not logged or stored and no personally identifiable information is used).  This allows us to better understand how users use the site so we can improve their experience.

	We use an addon developed by an
anti-fraud search engine
, I/O Labs.
