Cookies allow Cars.com to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. Cookies and web beacons can tell us what you have seen on the Site, which allows Cars.com to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and may also be used together to measure the effectiveness of Cars.com advertising campaigns. Cookies, web beacons, and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding usage (e.g., what website you came from, what pages of the Site you visit, how long you were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what Services you clicked on). Most browsers accept Cookies until you change your browser settings. If you do not wish for the Site to collect your information using Cookies, you can typically disable the use of Cookies (or disallow the use of Cookies on specific websites) by changing your browser settings. You may also disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages.

Meta Pixel
. With the help of the Meta pixel, also known as the Facebook Pixel, Meta Platforms Inc. ("Meta") is able to determine the visitors of our Sites and Services as a target group for the presentation of advertisements.

Meta may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes in accordance with Facebook’s
Data Usage Policy
. The Meta pixel also allows Meta and its partners to show you advertisements on and outside of the Meta social media platforms, including Facebook. You can opt-out of displaying Meta ads by visiting your Facebook
Ad Settings

Cookies allow Cars.com to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. Cookies and web beacons can tell us what you have seen on the Site, which allows Cars.com to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and may also be used together to measure the effectiveness of Cars.com advertising campaigns. Cookies, web beacons, and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding usage (e.g., what website you came from, what pages of the Site you visit, how long you were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what Services you clicked on). Most browsers accept Cookies until you change your browser settings. If you do not wish for the Site to collect your information using Cookies, you can typically disable the use of Cookies (or disallow the use of Cookies on specific websites) by changing your browser settings. You may also disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages.

Meta Pixel
. With the help of the Meta pixel, also known as the Facebook Pixel, Meta Platforms Inc. ("Meta") is able to determine the visitors of our Sites and Services as a target group for the presentation of advertisements.

Meta may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes in accordance with Facebook’s
Data Usage Policy
. The Meta pixel also allows Meta and its partners to show you advertisements on and outside of the Meta social media platforms, including Facebook. You can opt-out of displaying Meta ads by visiting your Facebook
Ad Settings

4. Exercising Access, Use Limitation, Data Portability, Deletion, and Correction Rights
To exercise the access, use limitation, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a consumer rights request to us by any of the following methods:
By calling 312.601.5000
By emailing privacy@cars.com
By using this
Privacy Information Request Form
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a consumer rights request related to your Personal Information. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us through the methods noted above. Only the consumer or authorized agent may make a consumer rights request related to their Personal Information. An “authorized agent” is a person (or a business entity registered with the California Secretary of State) that consumers have authorized to act on their behalf, or an individual granted authority under a written power of attorney issued pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.
If you are an authorized agent who wishes to submit a request to know, a request to limit use, a request to delete, or a request to opt-out on behalf of another consumer, please submit to us sufficient information to allow us to verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty and either:
Proof of authorization to submit the request, written and signed by the consumer; or
A power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.
We may deny a request from an authorized agent who does not submit adequate proof that they have been authorized by the consumer to act on the consumer's behalf. We may also contact the consumer directly to confirm their identity and that they provided you permission to submit the request on the consumer's behalf.
You may only make a consumer rights request for deletion, access, or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The consumer rights request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a consumer rights request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a consumer rights request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
5. Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a consumer rights request within thirty (30) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your consumer rights request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination & Financial Incentives
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
California Do Not Track Disclosure
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your web browsers, which allows you to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. We do not currently recognize or respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT, please see
