Privacy Policy
General information and scope
We value your and your child’s personal privacy highly and hereby want to explain how we collect, process and use your personal information when you use our App “CuboAi” and when you visit our website. We hereby promise you that when we are collecting, processing, and using your data, we shall comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The privacy policy applies to the processing of personal data by Yun Yun AI Baby camera Co., Ltd. with registered offices at Rm. 4, 19F., No. 2, Ln. 150, Sec. 5, Xinyi Rd., Xinyi Dist., Taipei City 110014, Taiwan (R.O.C.)

Data processing while using the CuboAi App
To use the CuboAi App, it will be necessary for you to register. Therefore you have to provide your email address and choose a password. All other information you provide is offered on a voluntary basis. We use this data to create and maintain your CuboAi Account. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) b) of the GDPR. We will not be transferring your registration information to third parties for commercial purposes. When you create an account, the data you provide will be saved on a revocable basis. To delete your customer account, please send an e-mail to
support@getcubo.com
.
When you install the CuboAi App and the CuboAi product, we shall invite you to provide some basic personal information, such as, the name(s), age(s), gender(s) of your child (children). The information you provide is used to create your own user environment. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) f) of the GDPR. If you do not agree to provide this data, you can choose to give pseudonyms. Please note that if you provide incorrect information (e.g. wrong age), certain features and analyses by the app may not work properly.
In order to provide the monitoring features of CuboAi it is necessary to process personal data of babies, toddlers and minors. In particular, video and audio recordings are processed.
CuboAi products will also upload the recorded audio and video data to Google Cloud Place (GCP) for storage (see https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy- for GCP's privacy policy), as well as clips judged by the AI to be memorable (for instance if baby is acting cute). Furthermore, the data in Memory Wall in CuboAi Application  will also be organized according to baby’s age for you to download and save.
CuboAi products also collect information on environment temperature, humidity, and decibel levels. We store this data in themonitor and upload it to our servers simultaneously. Our smart technology will analyze the data and detect dangerous situations. When our smart technology warns of any impending dangers around your child, the video and audio information will be stored in the monitor and listed by date in the “Notification” tab. You can download the information from the CuboAi mobile application. If you refuse to provide information on the environment temperature, humidity, and decibel levels, please refrain from using CuboAi’s products. CuboAi’s Sleep Sensor Pad uses its own micro motion detection algorithm to convert the movement detected from the surface of your little one’s mattress into unique data, and by transforming these movement data (i.e. the rise and fall of baby's chest) into Motion statistics, it allows parents to track baby’s real-time well-being status in the CuboAi App for better peace of mind. For instance, if the camera AI confirms the baby is in the crib, but the Sleep Sensor Pad detects no micro motion, it will send parents an alert. If you refuse to provide information on movement data, please refrain from using CuboAi’s products.
The main purpose of our services and products is to help parents pay immediate attention to their baby’s condition. CuboAi products combine AI artificial intelligence technology to actively detect potentially dangerous events (i.e. if baby has their face covered, roll over, or if their micro motion or other conditions signal potential danger) and send alerts to parents’ mobile devices. Therefore, to enhance the performance of our services and the statistical and analytical performance of our products, we collect, process, and utilize the voice recordings, photos, images, and other personal data of children (under the age of 12) using our products. By using our services and products, you consent to the collection, processing or use of your voice recordings, photographs, images and other personal information and that of the child (for whom you are the legal representative). If you do not consent to such collection, processing or use of personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove your child's personal information from our service and product servers and stop collecting the voice recordings, photographs, images or other personal information, but this may prevent you from continuing to use our service and products. See section titled "Your Rights" regarding removal of data.
The use of the monitoring features is only allowed for the legal representative of the child or for persons that have been authorized by the legal representative of the child. If this is not the case for you, you may not use the CuboAi App for monitoring a child. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) b) of the GDPR, because without processing this data, Yun Yun would not be able to perform the services according to the Terms of Service. The recordings will also be used to train CuboAi's algorithm to become increasingly better at recognizing dangerous situations for infants, such as their mouth or nose being covered. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) f) of the GDPR. We will not use the recordings for other purposes.
In order to use the CuboAi App with the CuboAi products it is necessary to provide the ID of the Wi-Fi router at your home to establish a secure internet connection. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) b) of the GDPR.
It is noted that in the course of providing the monitoring features to you, we may collect information that could reveal your and/or the child’s (children’) racial or ethnic origin. We do not analyze or exploit this information and process it only indirectly.
If you want to use sleep tracking, sleep analysis or breathing rate tracking features of the app, the data collected for these features constitute health data in the meaning of the GDPR. Therefore, this requires the consent of the legal representative of the child that is monitored by the CuboAi products. Before your first use of these features, we will ask you to provide consent. With your consent, you represent that you are the legal representative or that you have been authorized by the legal representative of the child to give said consent. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 9 (2) a) of the GDPR. If the consent is not given, these features can unfortunately not be used.
To improve the function of the CuboAi products and to provide a better user experience for you, as well as to ascertain the technical problems you encounter when using the CuboAi products, we shall collect technical information of your CuboAi product, such as the model type, serial number, software version, the strength of your Wi-Fi signal, and the log of your Product. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) f) of the GDPR.
CuboAi products allows you to freely adjust the settings regarding whether to store and share any specific information and content of you and/or the child (children). You can change settings in the App.
When you sign up for marketing and promotional communications and submit the questionnaire based on your consent, we shall thereby collect your email address, phone number, age(s) of your child (children) and questionnaire responses. We conduct a market analysis based on this data and send you promotional communications – according to your preferences and behavior – about Yun Yun products, services, events and promotions. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) a) of the GDPR. Registration is voluntary and not necessary to use the app. Yun Yun will give you the chance to withdraw your consent for receiving promotional communications at any time via the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each promotional communications email you may receive from us.
When you contact our online customer service by email, we shall thereby collect your email address, purchase history, and the content (communication records) of your questions or requests that you addressed to provide you with consumer support. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) b) of the GDPR. We also use this data to improve our products and services and to educate our customer service employees during training. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) f) of the GDPR.
New Clarifications for Platform Compliance
To address concerns about data collection, storage, and privacy, the following details clarify our practices regarding face-related data and other sensitive information:
Reasons for Storing Video Data:
The app processes video recordings to detect safety events, such as face coverage or rollovers. Notifications are sent to users in case of safety events. Retaining the video data ensures accurate event detection and allows users to review safety incidents.
Length of Retention:
Video recordings are stored locally on the CuboAi device for
18 hours
and then automatically deleted.
Thumbnails of safety event notifications are stored securely on Google Cloud Platform for
7 days
to allow users to review events. These thumbnails may include partial face images if relevant to the safety event.
Third-Party Sharing:
No facial data or thumbnails are shared with any third parties. Processing is handled exclusively on CuboAi’s servers.
Third-Party Processing and Storage Practices:
CuboAi utilizes third-party services for infrastructure support (e.g., Google Cloud). However:
No face data or facial recognition information is shared with or retained by third parties.
Third-party providers comply with GDPR and maintain data protection measures. Data transferred to these providers does not include personally identifiable facial information.
Your Rights and Data Deletion:
Users retain the right to:
Request deletion of any video recordings or associated thumbnails from CuboAi’s cloud storage.
Withdraw consent for data processing at any time. Note that withdrawing consent may limit functionality.

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

Personal Data We Process
The personal data we collect about you depends on your relationship with us and the purposes for which we process that personal data. The following describes the types of personal data that we collected and disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months.
Personal Data You Share With Us Directly
Contact Information -
When you sign up for a Twilio, Sendgrid or Segment account and use any of our Services, request product information, ask for a call from our sales team, or participate in events, we ask you to provide us with your name, company name, business address, phone number, email address and other contact information. We also ask you to create a password and name your account (or accounts, if you have more than one).
Customer Account Data -
We process certain personal data to manage our relationship with you and administer you or your company’s account. This includes purchase history, names or contact information of individuals authorized to manage the Twilio account on behalf of our customer to set up, access and manage billing. We also collect personal data required to administer use of your account and the Services, and information to allow us to verify your identity for Know Your Customer or other identity verification purposes.
Customer Content -
We receive and store the content of communications received from you or our customers and other personal data uploaded to the Services or generated for our customers’ use as part of the Services, which we may be authorized by you or our customer to use, where necessary for specific legitimate business purposes and in accordance with applicable law.
Marketing and Contact Preferences -
We use information about how you would like to be contacted and choices you have made to send you marketing communications.
Payment Information -
In connection with Services you pay for, we ask you to provide our payment processor with your payment method information like a credit card or your Paypal account and your billing address. Our payment processor, acting on our behalf, gathers this so we can bill you for your use of our Services. Our payment processor will share your billing address with Twilio for this purpose.
Personalization Details -
Some of our products, such as our short code service, may require you to complete an application form by providing details about your or your company’s  intended use of the product to determine eligibility for these products.
Professional Information -
The information we process about you with respect to your employment or profession, including company, job title, email address, phone number and online business networking profile.
Subscriber Records -
For some of our communications products, we may also obtain proof of identity from you or our customer that includes a proof of address, name, physical address, or other identification information. For example, to use our
Trust Hub
or to obtain a phone number in certain countries, local law may require us to have a physical service address on file for the individual who will be using that Twilio number, whether that’s you or our customer's end user.
Support and Feedback -
When you interact with us on our websites including through our AI chatbots (e.g. our Help Center Assistant), over the phone or via email, we process the phone number or email address that you use, the content of your interaction and the feedback you provide about our Services. You may also provide us with feedback about our Services in surveys and questionnaires. We will let you know when a call may be recorded, in accordance with applicable law.

Device Information and IP Addresses -
When you use our account portal, we collect your IP address and device information through tracking technologies like cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies.

Security Identifiers or SIDs -
When you sign up for an account with Twilio, we’ll automatically assign you and each of your accounts a unique security ID and generate an API token for each account. We keep a record of these credentials so we know it is you making the requests when your application makes requests to our API using these credentials.
Customer Proprietary Network Information -
When you use certain US voice-based communications services, Twilio collects information associated with your service usage. This includes information such as the number of phone calls, call destinations, call locations, type, and service configuration, and is known as Customer Proprietary Network Information ('CPNI'). CPNI does not include information such as your name, address, phone number, or the content of phone calls. We use CPNI to market Twilio-related Services to which you are not already subscribed unless you have exercised your right to opt out. For information about your CPNI choices, see the section “
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
” below.

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
’ below), we will honor this request, unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, such as billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
Depending on the data protection laws applicable to you, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal data that we process as a data controller:
that we provide details about the categories of personal data that we collect about you, including how we collect and share it;
that we provide you access to, and a copy of, the personal data we collect about you;
that we update or correct any inaccurate personal data we have about you;
that we delete the personal data we have about you;
that we restrict processing of personal data about you;
that we provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used format and to transmit that information to another controller, and where feasible, transmit the information directly;
that we provide you with the right to object to the processing of personal data, including profiling;
that we provide you with a free, easy mechanism to object to use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes;
that you not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects or similarly affects your individual rights;
to withdraw your consent; and
to complain to a competent supervisory authority and/or to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Twilio will honor your rights subject to limitations in certain situations, such as where Twilio can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement or legitimate interest to process your data or can legitimately apply an exemption to the exercise of a right under applicable law. More information about these rights can be found in our Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy
Rule 10
and
Appendix 3
.
If you are a
US resident
interested in what personal data we have disclosed lately for our business purposes, here’s a list:
Identifiers
Commercial information
Financial information
Internet or other electronic activity information
Geolocation information
Professional or employment information
By “our business purposes,” we mean that we only disclose personal data as we describe in the section "
How We Disclose Personal Data
" above.  Also, as described in the “How We Use Cookies & Other Tracking technologies” section below, we process personal data to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ websites and mobile apps. Some of these activities may be considered “sharing” or “targeted advertising” under certain laws. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.
You also have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Privacy Notice or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
You may have additional rights under our
Binding Corporate Rules
in the EU. For example, where you believe your personal data has been transferred by an EU-based Twilio company to our US headquarters and processed by the US company in breach of the Binding Corporate Rules, you may have a right to:
Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.
If Twilio processes your personal data as a data processor on behalf of a customer, we will either direct you to contact our customer to exercise your rights.
How To Exercise Your Rights and Choices
The following sections provide information about how to exercise certain rights in relation to your personal data. To exercise any other rights, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
.
Accessing and Controlling Account Data
As part of our Services, we provide you with a number of self-service features at no additional cost within the Twilio console itself, including the ability to access your data, update any incorrect data, download a copy of your data, delete your data, or restrict the use of your data. You can make various choices about your Customer Account Data through the account portal when you log into your Twilio account or through the marketing preferences center. Any other requests about your data you cannot make through these self-service tools, you can request by contacting
Customer Support
.
Closing Your Account and Deletion
To request closure or deletion of your Twilio account, you can contact
Customer Support
. Please be aware that closure or deletion of your Twilio account will result in you permanently losing access to your account and the data in the account. After closure of your account, certain information associated with your account may remain on Twilio’s servers in an aggregated form that does not identify you. Similarly, after you close your account, we will retain data — including personal data — associated with your account that we are required to maintain for legal purposes or for necessary business operations (see “
How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.
Identity Verification
In some instances, we will need to verify your identity before honoring your request.

How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your browser or elsewhere on your hard drive. Cookies allow Twilio to identify your device as you navigate our websites or your account. This makes navigating and interacting with our websites or your account more efficient, easy and meaningful for you.
Twilio uses both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies are cookies that disappear from your computer or browser when you turn off your computer. Persistent cookies stay on your computer even after you’ve turned it off.
The cookies on our websites fall into three categories: (1) Required Cookies, (2) Functional Cookies, and (3) Advertising Cookies. To learn more about each category of cookie, you can visit our cookie consent tool by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting.

If you decide to change your preferences at a later date, you can easily do so by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Please note that Required Cookies cannot be disabled and if you decide to opt-out of Functional Cookies, certain functionality of our websites or your account may be impacted.  Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific.

If you believe an underage person has signed up for a Twilio account, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
with the subject line “Children”.
Automated Decision Making
Automated decision-making occurs when an electronic system uses personal data to make a decision about you, without human involvement. Twilio uses automated decision-making leveraging a variety of signals derived from records we collect or obtain from third party vendors, to help monitor, identify, and suspend accounts sending spam or engaging in other abusive or fraudulent activity.  We may also use this information to evaluate your account application and make decisions about whether to approve or decline. If your account is suspended or not approved under these circumstances you will be notified and given an opportunity to request human review of the decision.
We may rely on other automated decision-making where:
We have notified you of the decision and provided you with the opportunity to request a human review of the decision
It is necessary to perform a contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights
We have your consent and we have put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights

Twilio Product Privacy
Twilio offers a range of industry-leading communications and customer data platform services to our customers. Depending on the Service, Twilio may be a data controller and data processor of personal data used to provide the Services.
Twilio processes personal data (Communications Usage Data and Customer Content) for most of our Services as a data processor acting on the instruction of our customer and in accordance with the terms of our agreement with a customer, our
Data Protection Addendum
, and service specific terms. Our Services provide customers with ways to control, access and secure their data.
We also offer customers the ability to store, delete, access, or exercise other choices about their personal data. The ability to make these choices depends on the Service being used and how it is being used by a customer. Customers are referred to our
API docs
for each of our Services, along with SendGrid’s
documentation
and Segment’s
documentation
to find more detailed information about managing personal data collected and stored in connection with their use of our Services. We also provide an overview of our retention and deletion practices, including how to delete data you control in our
support documentation
. We provide information about the security measures we use to protect our customer’s data  in our
Security Overview
, and if you are located in a country that requires you to obtain information about our supplemental measures, you may read more about those measures
here
.
For some of the Services we also act as a data controller where disclosed and agreed to by our customer in the agreement, Data Protection Addendum, product specific terms or via the customers’ use and configuration of a product or feature.As a data controller, Twilio is responsible for the processing of the personal data.
For more detail on our Services, please find information below or by visiting our
products page
.
Authy
The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.

10. 加州居民補充條款
根據加州消費者隱私保護法（簡稱「
CCPA
」）規定，本第10款適用於由Zendesk控制個人資料的處理方式與理由的情況下（CCPA稱為「企業」）所蒐集之關於加州個人的若干個人資料，並對前述本聲明其餘部分做內容補充。 本第10款規定並不適用於目前或先前員工、應徵者、約聘人員或代理人。
a. 額外資料處理揭露：
下方表格根據加州隱私權法定義，列出了我們曾向第三方出售、分享、或揭露的個人資料類別。 作為參考用，
第2款
的表格提供了我們所蒐集的個人資料類別，以及我們的個人資料揭露情形。
我們所蒐集的個人資料類別
加州隱私權法細節： 個人資料被「出售或分享」的第三方對象類別
識別碼
，例如您的姓名、電子郵件、郵寄地址、電話號碼、及裝置識別碼（例如廣告識別碼及　IP 位址）。
按照
第5款
所述，經營 Cookie 與追蹤技術的公司，例如行銷與廣告夥伴。
我們合作共同行銷或銷售我們產品與服務的業務夥伴，例如通路夥伴
商業資訊
，包括偏好，例如購買紀錄或傾向及交易資訊，例如銀行資訊。
不適用
網際網路或其他電子網路活動資訊與裝置資訊
，例如您的瀏覽紀錄、搜尋紀錄、裝置資訊、以及其他涉及您跟我們互動及使用我們產品、標的服務、電子郵件及其他數位財產的相關資訊（無論被動瀏覽或積極互動） 。
按照
第 5 款
所述，經營 Cookie 與追蹤技術的公司，例如行銷與廣告夥伴。
地理位置資訊
，例如基於您的IP位址、行動裝置位置、或您向我們提供的資訊所得到的約略位置（例如您透過網路表格提供的城市和州）。 您可能可以透過您裝置的設定，控制這種資料的蒐集作業。
按照
第 5 款
所述，經營 Cookie 與追蹤技術的公司，例如行銷與廣告夥伴。
音訊、電子、視覺及其他感官資訊
，例如我們場所的閉路電視錄影（例如在您造訪我們辦公室時）；您與我們的銷售或客戶支援團隊的互動記錄（例如根據相關法律規定的品質保證或訓練目的）；或客戶支援聊天或訊息記錄檔
不適用
加州法律所定義之推論
，例如您很可能會有正向反應的行銷情事。
不適用
敏感性個人資料
，例如疫苗接種證明或種族及族裔（選填）（在適用法律允許的情況下）。
不適用
儘管我們在過去12個月並未基於金錢目的而「出售」或「分享」個人資料，但我們就我們的數位資產所進行且涉及第三方的慣常實務，可能會被視為加州法律所定義之「銷售」或「分享」情事。 我們不會蓄意出售或分享任何未滿 16 歲的未成年人的個人資料。 我們不會為了推論關於您的特徵，而蒐集或處理加州法律所定義之「敏感性個人資訊」。 Zendesk 僅會在符合敏感性個人資訊限制權利的例外情況下，使用敏感性個人資訊。
財務動機
： 我們可能會提供福利或優惠，以換取您的個人資料，例如對填寫問卷調查的人提供折扣或折價券。 我們可能在這些問卷調查中，蒐集個人資料，例如您的姓名、聯絡資訊、偏好、經驗、信仰、意見、以及對調查問題的其他回覆內容。 參與問卷調查的情況，係受到該問卷調查的相關條款與條件規範限制，該等條款與條件會載明該問卷調查相關的任何財務動機以及如何參與調查。 您的資料的價值，亦即向您提供的優惠內容價值。 我們利用福利相關費用，計算其價值。 您可以在任何時間，透過向我們寄發電子郵件至
privacy@zendesk.com
，撤出任何財務動機。 我們如果提供其他類型的財務動機，我們會在請您參與時，向您分享各該優惠內容的重要條款。
b. 您的資料保護權利：
在符合法律限制情況下，部分加州居民可能有以下權利。
知情權。
您有權要求取得我們蒐集您個人資料類別的相關資訊、我們蒐集個人資料的來源類別、蒐集個人資料的目的、我們已揭露您個人資料的第三方對象類別、以及我們揭露您個人資料的目的（簡稱「
類別報告
」）。 您亦可要求取得我們所蒐集關於您的個人資料中的特定資料（簡稱「
特定資料報告
」）。
刪除權。
您有權要求我們刪除向您蒐集的個人資料。
訂正權。
您有權要求我們訂正我們所保留關於您的錯誤個人資料。
選擇退出銷售或分享的權利。
我們不會向第三方出售個人資料以換取金錢。 不過，如我們在
第5款
所說明，我們會向廣告夥伴分享資訊，並允許廣告夥伴在我們的數位財產蒐集資訊。 這種交換情形可能會被視為加州法律所訂之「銷售」或「分享」情事，而您有權利選擇退出這種個人資料「銷售」或「分享」情事。
加州居民可以透過使用我們的
網路表格
或向我們寄發電子郵件至
privacy@zendesk.com
，要求行使知情權、刪除權、訂正權。 我們不會以相關法律所禁止之任何方式歧視您行使該等權利。
如何完整行使選擇退出銷售或分享的權利：
為針對任何資訊的「銷售」或「分享」情事，完整行使選擇退出銷售或分享的權利，您必須採取以下兩個步驟：
利用我們的
網路表格
，提交選擇退出銷售或分享權利的請求；以及
按一下我們網站頁尾的「請勿出售或分享我們個人資訊」連結，停用廣告cookie與其他追蹤技術。 您必須在各個瀏覽器以及您使用的各個裝置上，為我們各個網站完成此步驟。 這些步驟有其必要性，因為如此我們才可以在各個瀏覽器及您使用的各個裝置上投放第一方cookie，以表明您已選擇退出。
如果您封鎖cookie，對於我們利用cookie、像素、及其他追蹤技術，在線上自動蒐集並向第三方揭露的裝置資料，我們將無法遵循您的選擇退出銷售或分享權利的請求。 如果您清除您瀏覽器的cookie，您將需要再次遵守第二步驟辦理。 在加州法律要求範圍內，我們會遵守各企業在瀏覽器上以普遍使用及認可格式發送的「請勿出售或分享」選擇退出偏好訊號，例如HTTP表頭欄位或JavaScript物件。
驗證：
為處理加州資料保護請求，取決於請求的性質，我們會需要取得相關資訊，以便在我們紀錄中找到您的資訊或驗證您的身分。 在大多數情況下，我們會要求您提供關於您的資料，包括您的姓名、電子郵件地址或其他資訊。 如果您提交一份知情權「特定資料報告」，根據偽證處罰原則，我們亦可能要求取得一份經您簽署的聲明書，表明您是所述之人。 在某些情況下，我們可能會要求其他資料和/或使用第三方幫助驗證您的身份。
授權代理人：
授權代理人可代表加州個人行使加州資料保護權利，但我們茲保留權利，得按前述規定，直接驗證該個人的身分。 授權代理人須透過我們的
網路表格
提交請求與我們聯絡，並表明其係以代理人身分提交請求。 我們可能要求代理人提供經您簽署之許可書，證明其具備代表您行事的權限。 我們亦可能要求您直接跟我們驗證您的身分，或直接向我們確認您確實已同意由授權代理人提交請求。
時間：
我們會在收到請求後十五個工作日內處理「選擇退出銷售或分享權利」的請求。 我們會在四十五日內回覆「刪除請求」及「知情權請求」，但如我們需更多時間者，我們會向您發通知，而且可能需要最多九十日的時間，才能回覆您的請求。
11. 歐洲經濟區、瑞士和英國的補充資訊
以下條款針對我們處理歐洲經濟區（即歐盟成員國、冰島、列支敦斯登及挪威）、瑞士及英國個人資料情形，對本聲明補充相關內容。 在最大適用範圍內，本聲明的其他部分如果與第11款的條款之間有任何相牴觸或不一致之處者，對於歐洲經濟區、瑞士和英國的個人資料處理作業， 應以第11款為準。
資料控制方：
跟您有主要關係的Zendesk法人個體（例如跟您簽訂標的服務契約的法人個體；向您提供行銷材料與推廣通訊的法人個體；您存取我們網站所在地區的主要法人個體）是本聲明所訂範圍內的資料控制方。 在大多數情況下，此為Zendesk, Inc.，除非另行通知您。
a. 處理資料的法律依據：
請參閱
第3款
，瞭解我們據以蒐集、處理、及使用個人資料的法律依據。
b. 您的資料保護權利：
依據適用的資料保護法規定，您對於您的個人資料，可能可以行使若干權利：
存取權。
您有權要求我們確認我們是否處理您的個人資料以及取得相關資訊，以及有權取得一份您受到處理的個人資料。
資料可攜權利。
您可以以結構化、常用且機器可讀取的格式，接收您已向我們提供之個人資料，而且您可能有權把該等資料傳輸給其他資料控制方，不會受到阻礙。 這項權利僅適用於資料處理作業係基於您的同意或契約所為，並且透過自動化方式進行的情況。
修正權。
您可能有權要求修正不正確的個人資料，並且補充不完整的資料。
拒絕權。
在若干情況下，您可能有權拒絕您的個人資料的處理作業。
限制處理權。
在若干情況下，您可能可以要求限制處理您的個人資料。
刪除權。
在若干情況下，您可能可以要求我們刪除您的個人資料。
提出申訴的權利。
您有權向主管機關提出申訴。 為了遵守歐盟-美國 DPF、歐盟-美國 DPF 的英國延伸 DPF 和瑞士-美國 DPF 規範，我們致力與歐盟資料保護機關 (DPA)、英國資訊專員辦公室 (ICO) 及直布羅陀監管局 (GRA)，以及瑞士聯邦資料保護和資訊專員 (FDPIC) 所成立的小組合作，並分別遵循其就我們根據歐盟-美國   DPF、歐盟-美國 DPF 的英國延伸 框架，以及瑞士-美國 DPF 收到的個人資料處理相關未解決投訴提出的建議。
拒絕或撤回同意的權利。
在我們徵得您的同意後才能處理您個人資料的情況，您可以自行拒絕同意。 如果您已授予同意，您可以在任何時間撤回同意，不會有任何不良後果。 在您撤回同意之前，對您的個人資料進行的任何處理的合法性將不受影響。
拒絕受到自動化決策的權利。
歐盟/英國一般資料保護規範（簡稱「
GDPR
」）第 22(1)與(4)款規定所稱之自動化決策類別，並不會使用在您的個人資料。 如有任何變動，我們會向您告知任何該等決定的原因與方式、其所代表的意義、以及可能的後果。 您也會有權要求人工介入，表達您的觀點，以及對決定提出異議。
您可以利用前述
第9款
所提供細節與我們聯絡，以行使該等權利。 請注意，在若干情況下，我們可能拒絕對行使資料保護權利的請求做出回應，例如提供存取權可能侵犯他人的隱私權或影響我們的法律義務者。
c. 個人資料之國際傳輸：
由於我們的營運業務遍佈全球，本聲明
第 2 款
提及之若干接收者可能位於歐洲經濟區、瑞士或英國以外的國家，而該等國家並未提供歐洲經濟區、瑞士和英國的資料保護法所定義的妥善資料保護程度。 在Zendesk集團內部的資料傳輸，以及向位於該等第三國家的第三方所為之資料傳輸，都會以經許可的法定減損情況為基礎，使用有效的資料傳輸機制，例如歐盟制式化契約條款及/或該等條款的 英國附加條款、經核准的具拘束力企業規則、經核准的行為準則與認證機制，或由歐洲經濟區、瑞士或英國主管機關發佈或核准的其他任何有效資料傳輸機制。 如欲瞭解我們的具拘束力企業規則的更多相關資訊（包括取得一份規則），可以前往

United States Regional Privacy Notice
Introduction
In our mission to make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use information about you, our
merchants using Shopify
to power your business
customers
who shop at a Shopify-powered business
partners
who develop apps for merchants to use, build stores on behalf of merchants, refer potential entrepreneurs to Shopify, or otherwise help merchants operate or improve their Shopify-powered business
users of Shopify apps
and services like
Shop
or
Shop Pay
visitors to
Shopify’s websites
, or anyone contacting
Shopify support
This Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect, use, and share your personal information. If we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy. If any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through the Shopify admin or by email).
Our values
Trust is the foundation of the Shopify platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy.
Your information belongs to you
We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind. In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit.
We protect your information from others
If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden.
We help merchants and partners meet their privacy obligations
Many of the merchants and partners using Shopify do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations. To do this, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way. We also provide detailed FAQs and documentation covering the most important privacy topics, and respond to privacy-related questions we receive.
Why we process your information
We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). Laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) call these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:
preventing risk and fraud
answering questions or providing other types of support
helping merchants find and use apps through our app store
providing and improving our products and services
providing reporting and analytics
testing out features or additional services
assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications
We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with certain measures—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.
We may also process your personal information where you have provided your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing, where you direct us to transfer information to a third party, where we receive your data from a third party is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities). At any time, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices, opting out from our communications or by contacting us.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, to understand our purposes for processing, categories of recipients and legal basis for processing for each type of personal data.
Your rights over your information
We believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live. Depending on how you use Shopify, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information. We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights. Please note that a number of these rights apply only in certain circumstances, and all of these rights may be limited by law.
If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchase or interaction, you need to directly contact the merchant you interacted with. We are a processor and process information on their behalf. We will of course help our merchants to fulfill these requests to the extent required by law, such as by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions.
If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with, please submit your data subject request through our
online portal
. Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond. In order to do so, we may use a third party to collect and verify identification documents. Further information about rights available to US residents can be found below under the header “United States Regional Privacy Notice”.
If you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue. If you are located in the EEA or UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection or privacy authority at any time.
Finally, because there is no common understanding about what a
“Do Not Track”
signal is supposed to mean, we don’t respond to those signals in any particular way.
Where we send your information
We are a Canadian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world. To operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country, including to the United States. This data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it. We take steps to protect your information when we send your information across borders.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant.
Transfers outside of Europe and Switzerland
If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, your personal information is controlled by our Irish affiliate, Shopify International Ltd. Your information is then sent to other Shopify locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States. When we send your personal information outside of the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law, which the European Commission has found adequately protects your information. If we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example, when we send this information to our
Subprocessors
), this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in the
Standard Contractual Clauses.
Finally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example, if we receive a valid court order). For information about how we respond to such orders, please review our
Guidelines for Legal Requests
.
How long do we retain your information
We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements. We will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies. If you stop using our services or if you delete your account with us, we will delete your information or store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, for further details on the retention of your personal information.
Our use of Machine Learning
One of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like “machine learning” (some laws, including certain EEA and UK laws, may refer to this as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our services. When we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don’t have legal or similarly significant effects (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store).
How we protect your information
Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information. However, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You can find more information about our security measures at
/ie/security
.
How we use “cookies” and other tracking technologies
We use
cookies
and similar tracking technologies on our website and when providing our services. For more information about how we use these technologies, including a list of other companies that place cookies on our sites, a list of cookies that we place when we power a merchant’s store, and an explanation of how you can opt out of certain types of cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
How you can reach us
If you would like to ask about, make a request relating to, or complain about how we process your personal information, please contact
Shopify Support
, or mail us at one of the addresses below. If you would like to submit a legally binding request to demand someone else’s personal information (for example, if you have a subpoena or court order), please review our
Guidelines for Legal Requests
.
If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with and you are located in the EEA or UK, Shopify International Ltd is the controller of your personal data. If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store, the merchant is your data controller and we are acting as a processor on their behalf.
If you have questions about how a merchant or store processes your personal information, you should contact the merchant or visit their privacy policy.

United States Regional Privacy Notice
This United States Regional Privacy Notice (“US Notice”) supplements our Privacy Policy and all supplemental privacy policies on
www.shopify.com
(together, the “Shopify Privacy Policies”).
This US Notice is for individuals residing in certain US states and is designed to help you better understand how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information and, depending on how you use Shopify and where you reside, how to exercise available rights under various applicable privacy laws in the US, specifically the California Consumer Privacy Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (collectively, the “US Privacy Laws”).
What information we collect and share about you

Why we collect and share your Personal Information
We use and share your personal information for the purposes set out in the Shopify Privacy Policies. For categories of sensitive personal information that we collect, we only use or disclose such information either with your specific consent when required, or as otherwise permitted by law.
Sources of Personal Information
To make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use personal information provided by:
You: We collect the information you provide when you use our platform, including when you sign up for Shopify as a merchant, visit a Shopify-powered store, fill in order information, visit one of Shopify’s websites or contact Shopify support. We collect account and payment information you provide to us (including information about your business if you are a merchant), Shopify stores or items you save to favorites, purchases you make, reviews you post, and how you otherwise interact or communicate with stores or other users on our apps or services. We also collect information about how you browse through our apps and sites, including search terms you may enter.
Your device(s): We collect information from and about the devices you use, including computers, phones, and other web-connected devices you use to access our apps or services, and we combine this information across different devices you use.
Third parties: We receive information from partners who help us provide you with our services including the following:
Email providers. If you use the Shop App and you connect your third party inboxes, such as Gmail or Outlook (according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law), we receive information to identify shopping-related emails and display within Shop information about specific orders you have made, stores you have engaged with in the past, and other related information.
Service Providers. We receive information from our service providers, who help us provide services to our merchants, like reviewing accounts for fraud or other concerns.
Marketplaces. If you use the Shop App, we receive information about purchases you have made from other marketplaces or platforms, such as Amazon, that you choose to connect through Shop. This information helps us to provide and improve Shop, to personalize your experience using our apps and services, and to determine if you are eligible for specific offers or payment methods.
Subprocessors. We work with third party subprocessors for cloud hosting, content delivery, data analysis, internal logging, fulfillment services and email transmission, among others, to provide you with our services. For more information, see Shopify’s subprocessors.
Analytics and cookie providers. We receive information through our use of cookies, social plugins (such as the Facebook “like” button), pixels and tags for business purposes, such as providing information to help measure how users interact with our website content. For more information about how we use these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.
How long we keep your information
Because we need your personal information to provide Shopify services, we generally keep your personal information, including sensitive personal information, while you use Shopify products or services or until you tell us to delete your information. We may also keep personal information to comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests.
If you are a merchant operating a Shopify-powered store, and you close the store, stop paying your subscription fees, or we terminate your account, we retain store information for two years before we begin the deletion process.
When you visit or make a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, we act as a service provider or processor for the merchant, and the merchant, not Shopify, decides how long your information is retained.
Your rights over your information
Depending on where you live, how you use Shopify, and subject to certain exceptions, you may have some or all of the following rights:
Right to Know: The right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we collect, use, or disclose about you, and information about our data practices.
Right to Request Correction: The right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.
Right to Request Deletion: The right to request that we delete personal information that we have collected about you.
To exercise your rights, including the “right to know” and “right to delete,” please submit a request through our online portal. If you use Shop or Shop Pay, please visit
https://shop.app/delete-account
for instructions on how to request deletion of your information.
If you have visited or made a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, please contact the specific merchant directly. If you make a request to us, we will forward your request to the relevant merchant.
Please note that to protect your information and the integrity of our products and services, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In some cases we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as your email address or a government issued ID.
Under US Privacy Laws, you may also designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may need to collect additional information, such as a government issued ID, to verify your identity before processing your request to protect your information.
For information on the CCPA requests we have received, please see here. In certain states, you may have the right to appeal our decision regarding a request related to these rights. If you wish to appeal a decision, please contact Shopify Support.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
