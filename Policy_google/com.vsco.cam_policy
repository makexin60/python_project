Opting out of “sales,” “sharing,” and processing for “targeted advertising” purposes.
We work with advertising partners and intermediaries (e.g. ad networks, sell-side or demand-side platforms, identity resolution providers, clean rooms, measurement providers, publishers, advertisers/agencies) to help deliver targeted ads to you on VSCO or other properties based on your activity across unrelated properties (e.g. your activity on VSCO and social media networks or other digital properties) and to measure the effectiveness of such ads.
Using cookies or other tracking technologies, we make personal information (e.g. device data tied to online activity data, identity data such as email addresses or phone numbers) available to such partners or intermediaries for such purposes. We may also upload information (e.g. email address, phone number) about our Creators to these partners or intermediaries to facilitate such purposes.

As otherwise described in the Privacy Policy
These activities constitute our legitimate interests determined based on your legitimate expectations after purpose and necessity considerations. We do not use your personal data for these activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). This does not apply to sensitive data under LGPD (e.g. social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership). Processing of sensitive data will be based on your consent as detailed in item “Sensitive Personal Data” below.
Processing activities for which you have consented
Where we rely on your consent, you have the right to withdraw it any time in the manner indicated when you consent or in our Services.
‍
Use for new purposes
. We can use your personal data for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.
Retention
. We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
When we no longer require the personal data we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we can use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Sensitive personal data
. We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal data (e.g. social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through our Services, or otherwise to us.
If you provide us with any sensitive personal data to us when you use our Services, you are consenting to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such sensitive personal data through our Services.
Your rights
. You have the following rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you:
Right of access
: You can ask us if we are processing your personal data and to provide you with a copy of such data (along with certain details). If you require additional copies, we need to charge a reasonable fee.
Right to rectification
: If the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to request to have it rectified.
Right to erasure
: You can ask us to delete or remove your personal data in some circumstances such as where we no longer need it or if you withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (where applicable).
Right to restrict processing
: You can ask us to 'block' or suppress the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of that personal data.
Right to data portability
: You have the right, in certain circumstances, to obtain personal data you have provided us with (in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format) and to reuse it elsewhere or to ask us to transfer this to a third party of your choice.
Right to object
: You can ask us to stop processing your personal data, and we will do so, if we are:
relying on our own or someone else's legitimate interests to process your personal data, unless we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing; or
processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Right to withdraw consent
: If we rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority
: If you have a concern about any aspect of our privacy practices, including the way we have handled your personal data, you can report it to the Brazilian Data Protection Authority (Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados – “
ANPD
”).
You can submit these requests through our
Help Center
. We can request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law can require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
Cross-border data transfer
. While ANPD has not determined which countries provide an adequate level of personal data protection for LGPD purposes, after such determination, if the transfer is to a country not recognized as adequate by ANPD, the transfer will be performed:
pursuant to the recipient’s compliance with ANPD’s standard contractual clauses or equivalent standard contractual clauses from other countries as determined by ANPD;
Binding corporate rules or bespoke contractual clauses approved by ANPD;
pursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the personal data pertains; or
as otherwise permitted by applicable laws.

Use for new purposes
. We may use your personal data for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.
Retention.
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
When we no longer require the personal data we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Sensitive personal data.
We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal data (e.g. social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through our Services, or otherwise to us.
If you provide us with any sensitive personal data to us when you use our Services, you are consenting to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such sensitive personal data through our Services.
Your rights
. You have the following rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you:
Right of access
: You can ask us if we are processing your personal data and to provide you with a copy of it (along with certain details). If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.
Right to rectification
: If the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to request to have it rectified.
Right to erasure
: You can ask us to delete or remove your personal data in some circumstances such as where we no longer need it or if you withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (where applicable).
Right to restrict processing
: You can ask us to 'block' or suppress the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of that personal data.
Right to data portability:
You have the right, in certain circumstances, to obtain personal data you have provided us with (in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format) and to reuse it elsewhere or to ask us to transfer this to a third party of your choice.
Right to object
: You can ask us to stop processing your personal data, and we will do so, if we are:
relying on our own or someone else's legitimate interests to process your personal data, unless we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing; or
processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Right to withdraw consent:
If we rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority:
If you have a concern about any aspect of our privacy practices, including the way we have handled your personal data, you can report it to the relevant supervisory authority. You can find your data protection regulator

Cross-border data transfer
. If we transfer your personal data out of Europe to a country not deemed to provide an adequate level of personal data protection for purposes of applicable data protection laws such that additional safeguards are required, the transfer will be performed:
pursuant to the recipient’s compliance with Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules;
pursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the personal data pertains; or

”) your personal data in accordance with the PRC Personal Information Protection Law (“
PIPL
”) and the relevant applicable laws. The terms used in this Privacy Notice for China Residents have the definitions given to them under PIPL, including terms such as “
data processor
” and “

.”
Legal basis
Unlike in other jurisdictions, a legitimate interest is not a justified legal basis to process personal data in China. Consequently, we will obtain your proper consent for processing of your personal data as required by the PIPL and other relevant laws.
You hereby grant your separate consent to the cross-border data collection and other relevant data processing activities set forth in this Privacy Policy. In the event of any material change of the purpose or method of processing or the type of personal data we process, we will re-obtain your consent.
We will secure your separate consent if we undertake any of the following data processing activities in a manner that materially differs from this Privacy Policy:
Processing of sensitive personal data;
Use of personal data in automated decision-making;
Provision of personal data to another personal data processor
Disclosure of the personal data we Processed to the public; or
Cross-border collection of your personal data
For the avoidance of any doubt, “sensitive personal data” refers to the personal data that is likely to result in damage to the personal dignity of any natural person or damage to his or her personal or property safety once disclosed or illegally used, including such information as biometric identification, religious belief, specific identity, medical health, financial account and precise geolocation, as well as the personal data of minors under the age of 14.

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
