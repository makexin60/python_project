Updates to this notice
1. Who we are
The entity responsible for the processing of personal data referred to below is Volvo Car Corporation, having its registered office at Assar Gabrielssons Väg, SE-405 31 Gothenburg, Sweden, company registration number 556074-3089, hereinafter referred to as “Volvo Cars”, “we”, or “us”. If other entities are processing personal data together with us, so called joint controllers, this will be specified.
2. What personal data we use and why
2.1 Data used for infotainment purposes
2.1.1 Driving Journal
The Driving Journal automatically logs all your trips. This may be useful if, for example, you want to manage your mileage expenses. The Driving Journal must be activated by you, otherwise the data is not collected.
If you enable the Driving Journal, we will collect your identifiers such as first and last name, phone number, E-mail address, your vehicle identification number (VIN), and the vehicle’s location as well as other trip related information such as your routes, time, distance, fuel and/or electric consumption and mileage. Depending on your vehicle model only start and finish position is collected or the full route.
We process this data based on your consent.
As a rule, the Driving Journal’s data is stored for up to 400 days depending on car model. You can disable the Driving Journal at any time, and by doing so the data will stop being collected. This does not trigger the deletion of previously collected information.
2.1.2 Over the air software updates (OTA)
Over the air software updates enable your vehicle to update and maintain the latest software without visiting a workshop. Using the latest software ensures you can fully utilize our updated services. By using the latest software, you are also improving your protection against cybersecurity incidents.
To maintain vehicle software and provide necessary software updates, we process the following data:
Vehicle identification number (VIN)
Vehicle software version
Diagnostic trouble codes
Vehicle manufacturing date
Vehicle specification
Installation status and reports
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is your consent.
We will retain records of the software updates made for the entire vehicle lifetime.
You can agree or disagree to automatic software updates at any time in the privacy settings. If you agree, software updates are downloaded automatically, and you will be notified when the update is ready to install. If you disagree, you will be notified when a new update is available and can be downloaded. If you don’t want to use over the air software updates, you can have updates installed in a workshop with the required connection to our systems.
2.1.3 Connected Safety
Our vehicles are equipped with Connected Safety, a service offered by us, which informs you about current traffic hazards while you drive the vehicle. This information is based on information sent from other vehicles or from public sources where applicable. This information is used to alert you on changing road conditions or potential road hazard early on by displaying appropriate warnings, allowing you to adapt your driving style accordingly. If your own vehicle detects a potential road hazard, such as reduced friction between your tires and the road or if the hazard warning lights are activated, this information is sent to Volvo Cars. The information is aggregated and anonymized before sent to vehicles approaching your own vehicle’s position.
The data that we collect and process to support Connected Safety is:
Vehicle identification number (VIN)
Event such as Slippery road alert activation, Hazard light activation etc.
Time stamp of each alert
Location
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is performance of the contract. You can switch the service on and off at any time.
In addition, the abovementioned data is processed anonymously and transmitted to traffic agencies and companies, in order to avoid and reduce dangers posed by road traffic, but also to improve road safety, to reduce maintenance costs and contribute to a sustainable traffic environment. Volvo Cars and Polestar Performance AB (a Swedish company headquartered in Gothenburg, Assar Gabrielssons Väg 9, SE-405 31, Sweden, hereinafter referred to as “Polestar”) are joint controllers for these purposes. As so-called joint controllers under GDPR, Volvo Cars and Polestar are jointly responsible for this processing. Volvo Cars and Polestar have agreed that Volvo Cars is responsible for providing information to its customers, and that the respective rights afforded by GDPR will be exercised by Volvo customers in relation to Volvo Cars.
We will retain the information for 1 week.
2.1.4 Digital Key
Digital key can fully replace the conventional car key, and allows you to conveniently lock, unlock, or start your vehicle with your smartphone or smart watch. In addition, it is also possible to share your key with additional users through various digital channels.
Digital key only requires network connection during the initial one-time set-up, for sharing of keys, or revoking keys. Once set-up, the key will work via Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), and Ultra-Wideband Technology (UWB). During set-up, your key will be added to your wallet app in your smart device. From your wallet app you can share your key through messaging apps, mail, or via Airdrop
®
. You can also easily revoke keys you have shared, either through the wallet app, or in the vehicle infotainment system.
The following data is processed when using digital key:
Vehicle identification number (VIN)
Vehicle details
Vehicle status
Volvo ID
Key ID
Friendly name
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is performance of the contract.
We will retain your data as long as you have a valid contract.
2.1.5 Real-time Traffic Information (RTTI)
The Real Time Traffic Information service receives information about road traffic information from a 3rd party service provider.
We process the following data from the car:
Vehicle position and speed – these are shared with the 3rd party service provider to calculate congestion and to inform you and other drivers where risks for congestion exist; these data points are anonymous for the 3rd party service provider.
Vehicle Identity Number (VIN) – this is used by Volvo Cars to verify that your vehicle has a subscription for this service.
Car models equipped with sensors that can identify traffic signs in real time as you drive do this through local processing (in the car) only.
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is performance of the contract. You can switch the service on and off at any time.
The data will be stored by Volvo Cars as long as the subscription is active. Once the subscription is inactive, VIN, speed and position are stored for maximum of 90 days, unless a longer time is required under local applicable law.
2.1.6 Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA)
Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA) is a mandatory function in some jurisdictions that uses road sign data to assist cars in keeping the speed limit. In order to know the speed limit on the current road ISA uses the car’s navigation system to fetch road sign data. The navigation system in turn needs the car's position to provide the correct data.
In addition, Volvo Cars is legally required to report aggregated data on your usage of the vehicle, like:
how much time or how long distances you have travelled with the advanced vehicle systems activated or deactivated
how much time or how long distanced you have travelled by observing or overriding the recognized speed limits
the time elapsed between the activation and deactivation of the advanced vehicle systems
To support ISA and the reporting, the following data is processed:
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
Vehicle speed
Vehicle details (model, production year)
Information generated by the vehicle, its sensors and systems (warnings, faults, diagnostics, status and behaviour of the advanced vehicle systems)
Information related to how the vehicle is used and operated (settings, use of the advanced vehicle systems)
Location
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is to fulfil our legal obligations.
We retain the information until it has been aggregated and sent to relevant authorities.

Roadside Assistance (RSA)
RSA involves supporting you when you experience a technical fault with your vehicle, such as a flat tire or a fault with the engine/motor. In some cases, the agent at the call centre is able to provide guidance on the call to you on how to remedy the issue. In other cases, the repair can be made at the roadside (called a ‘spot repair’) or, where that is not possible, your vehicle will need towing to a workshop to be fixed. The agent will assess what response is appropriate during the call. Where roadside recovery is needed (spot repair or a tow), assistance vehicles can be provided by a third party, such as a roadside vehicle towing and repair company, who then will process the related data.
Stolen Vehicle Tracking (SVT)
SVT is a way to locate your vehicle if stolen. A vehicle may be reported stolen by:
the vehicle itself. This happens when the vehicle detects a trigger of the vehicle alarm, which causes a notification, known as a ‘theft notification’, to be sent to any driver with the Volvo Cars App connected to the vehicle, as well as to the call centre.
the owner of the vehicle, that makes a call to the call centre.
local law enforcement (police). Again, a call is made directly to the call centre.
For the SVT process to be initiated an official police report must be filed and the report case number needs to be submitted to the call centre.
Remote Vehicle Immobilisation/Mobilisation (RVI/RVM)
RVI/RVM can be used to enable or disable the immobiliser in the vehicle. If the immobiliser is enabled, the vehicle will not be able to be started until the immobiliser is disabled. The vehicle can then be remotely mobilised. This service is initiated by the call centre agent.
In order to provide you with the services described above, we will automatically collect the following data when contacting the call centre through the “on call”/assist button in the vehicle or through the Volvo Car App:
License plate

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our

Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages

similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.

For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.

the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

kontaktuppgifter (t.ex. efternamn, förnamn, adress, e-postadress)
kontouppgifter (t.ex. inloggningskonto för Volvo public charging service, betalningsinformation)
fordonsuppgifter (VIN)
Avtalsuppgifter raderas automatiskt efter att Volvo public charging service-avtalet har utlöpt. Ekonomiska transaktioner raderas i enlighet med lagstadgade bestämmelser efter 10 år.
Tillhandahållande av tjänster
För att DCS ska tillhandahålla Volvo public charging service-tjänsterna behandlas följande (vid behov person)uppgifter (art. 6(1)(b) i Dataskyddsförordningen):

DCS förbehåller sig rätten att visa utvärderingarna via webbplatsen, appen och andra kanaler (nedan kallat ”gränssnitt") tillsammans med kundens initialer, för att visa dem för andra användare i syfte att förbättra tjänsten och kundupplevelsen. Dessutom är det möjligt att DCS kommer att göra värderingarna tillgängliga för partner i DCS-nätverket för visning i sina respektive gränssnitt.

Enhetsrelaterade data: Enhetstyp, operativsystem, språkinställningar, tidszoner, plats, app-inställningar, app-krascher och andra fel
I enskilda fall kan dina personuppgifter överföras till tredje parter. Det är företag inom kategorierna för IT-tjänster, logistik, telekommunikation, konsultverksamhet, kundtjänst och påminnelser. Dessa kan också vara belägna utanför Europeiska ekonomiska samarbetsområdet (EES), det vill säga i tredjeländer. Vissa tredjeländer är certifierade av EU-kommissionen att ha skydd som är jämförbart med EES-standarden genom så kallade
beslut om adekvat skyddsnivå
. Däremot kan det i andra tredjeländer dit personuppgifter kan överföras inte finns någon hög dataskyddsnivå på grund av bristande lagbestämmelser. Vi säkerställer att dataskyddet är tillräckligt garanterat om så är fallet. Detta är möjligt genom bindande företagsregler

Tjänster från tredje part (Google Maps)
För att säkerställa korrekt inmatning av adresser har vi integrerat tjänsten Google Maps från Google Ireland Limited (Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland) i våra tjänster via en API. Google agerar för vår räkning i denna fråga. För att visa innehållet i din webbläsare måste Google inhämta din ip-adress, annars kan de inte förse dig med det inbäddade innehållet.
Den rättsliga grunden för behandling förlitar sig på art. 6.1.b i GDPR, d.v.s. vi behandlar dina personuppgifter utfrån avtalet. Du kan inaktivera tjänsten Google Maps och därmed hindra överföringen av data till Google genom att inaktivera JavaScript i din webbläsare. Dock vill vi påpeka att du då inte kan använda kartvisningen på våra sidor.
Google kan komma att överföra den inhämtade informationen till tredje part om så krävs enligt lagen eller i den utsträckning tredje parter behandlar dessa data å Googles vägnar.
Mer information om syftet med och omfattningen av datainhämtningen och hur den behandlas av leverantören av insticksprogrammet hittas i leverantörens integritetspolicy. Där hittar du också ytterligare information om dina rättigheter samt inställningar för att skydda din integritet:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
.
Vem överför vi dina personuppgifter till?
Vi vidarebefordrar endast dina personuppgifter till tredje part om det krävs för att kunna uppfylla avtalet eller om du har lämnat ditt uttryckliga medgivande. För kunder med ”Volvo ID” kommer vi att överföra dina fordonsuppgifter (VIN) till Volvo Car Corporation,för att kunna fakturera dig och genomföra behörighetskontrollen som är obligatorisk för nya fordon.
Hur skyddar vi dina personuppgifter?
Vi skyddar dina uppgifter med hjälp av den senaste tekniken. Till exempel används följande säkerhetsåtgärder för att skydda dina personuppgifter mot missbruk eller någon annan form av obehörig behandling:
tillgången till personuppgifter begränsas till ett begränsat antal behöriga personer för de angivna syftena.
insamlade uppgifter överförs bara i krypterad form.
dessutom övervakas tillgången till dessa IT-system permanent för att detektera och avvärja missbruk på ett tidigt stadium.
Vi lagrar bara dina personuppgifter så länge som det krävs för respektive ändamål. Om uppgifterna behandlas för flera ändamål kommer de automatiskt att raderas, eller lagras i en form som inte kan spåras direkt till dig, så snart det senast angivna syftet har uppfyllts.
När du kontaktar oss, dina dataskyddsrättigheter och din rätt att klaga till Datainspektionen
Du har rätt att begära tillgång till dina personuppgifter, korrigering, radering eller begränsning av behandlingen och motsätta dig behandlingen genom att kontakta Digital Charging Solutions GmbH, Rosenstraße 18-19, 10178 Berlin, Tyskland, e-post:
