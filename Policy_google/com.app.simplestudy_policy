About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device

requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Declaração de privacidade do GitHub
Data de efetivação: 1° de fevereiro de 2024
Boas–vindas à Declaração de Privacidade do GitHub. Descrevemos como lidamos com seus "Dados Pessoais", que são informações que estão diretamente vinculadas ou podem estar vinculadas a você. Isso é aplicável aos Dados Pessoais que o GitHub, Inc., ou o GitHub B.V., processa como "Controlador de Dados" quando você interage com sites, aplicativos e serviços que exibem essa Declaração (coletivamente, "Serviços"). Esta Declaração não se aplica a serviços ou produtos que não exibam esta Declaração, como Previews, quando relevante.
Aviso ao usuário final: contas do GitHub fornecidas pela organização
Quando uma escola ou empregador fornece sua conta do GitHub, ele assume o papel de Controlador de Dados para a maioria dos Dados Pessoais usados em nossos Serviços. Isso permite:
Gerenciar e administrar sua conta do GitHub, incluindo o ajuste das configurações de privacidade.
Acessar e utilize seus Dados Pessoais, que incluem detalhes sobre como você usa os Serviços, bem como seu conteúdo e arquivos.
Se você acessar um Serviço GitHub por meio de uma conta fornecida por uma organização, como seu empregador ou escola, a organização se tornará o Controlador de Dados, e a aplicabilidade direta desta Declaração de Privacidade a você será alterada. Mesmo assim, o GitHub continua dedicado a preservar seus direitos de privacidade. Nessas circunstâncias, o GitHub funciona como um Processador de Dados, aderindo às instruções do Controlador de Dados em relação ao processamento de seus Dados Pessoais. Um Contrato de Proteção de Dados rege a relação entre o GitHub e o Controlador de Dados. Para obter mais detalhes sobre suas práticas de privacidade, consulte a declaração de privacidade da organização que fornece sua conta.
Nos casos em que sua organização concede acesso aos produtos GitHub, o GitHub atua como Controlador de Dados exclusivamente para atividades de processamento específicas. Essas atividades são claramente definidas em um contrato com a sua organização, conhecido como Contrato de Proteção de Dados. Você pode revisar nosso Contrato de Proteção de Dados padrão no
Contrato de Proteção de Dados do GitHub
. Para esses fins limitados, esta Declaração determina o tratamento dos seus Dados Pessoais. Para todos os outros aspectos do uso do produto GitHub, as políticas da sua organização são aplicáveis.
Acesso por terceiros e proteção de dados
Quando você usa extensões, integrações de terceiros ou segue referências e links em nossos Serviços, as políticas de privacidade desses terceiros são aplicáveis a quaisquer Dados Pessoais que você tenha fornecido ou consentido em compartilhar com eles. Suas declarações de privacidade determinarão como esses dados são processados.
Dados pessoais que coletamos
Os Dados Pessoais são coletados de você diretamente, automaticamente do seu dispositivo e também de terceiros. Os Dados Pessoais que o GitHub processa quando você usa os Serviços dependem de variáveis como a forma como você interage com nossos Serviços (como por meio de interfaces da Web, aplicativos móveis ou de desktop), os recursos que você usa (como solicitações pull, Codespaces ou GitHub Copilot) e seu método de acesso aos Serviços (seu IDE preferido). Abaixo, detalhamos as informações que coletamos por meio de cada um desses canais:

Fontes disponíveis publicamente: podemos adquirir informações sobre você de fontes disponíveis publicamente, como repositórios públicos do GitHub.
Serviços que você vinculou à sua conta do GitHub: Quando você ou seu administrador integram aplicativos ou serviços de terceiros aos nossos Serviços, recebemos informações com base em suas configurações com esses serviços. Isso pode incluir detalhes como seu nome e e-mail de serviços como o Google para autenticação. As informações que recebemos dependem das configurações e políticas de privacidade do terceiro. Sempre revise esses dados para entender quais dados são compartilhados com nossos Serviços.
Fornecedores, Parceiros e Afiliados: Podemos receber informações sobre você de terceiros, como fornecedores, revendedores, parceiros ou afiliados para os fins descritos nesta declaração.
Finalidades do processamento: como usamos seus dados pessoais
Os Dados Pessoais que processamos dependem da sua interação e métodos de acesso com os nossos Serviços, incluindo as interfaces (web, desktop, aplicativos móveis), recursos usados (pull requests, Codespaces, GitHub Copilot) e suas ferramentas de acesso preferidas (como seu IDE). Esta seção detalha todas as possíveis maneiras pelas quais o GitHub pode processar seus Dados Pessoais:
Operações comerciais: usamos Dados Pessoais para atividades como faturamento, contabilidade e compensação. Isso inclui a criação de dados estatísticos agregados para relatórios internos, relatórios financeiros, planejamento de receita, planejamento de capacidade e modelagem de previsão (incluindo estratégia de produto).
Comunicação: Usamos Dados Pessoais para informá-lo sobre novos Serviços, recursos, ofertas, promoções e outras informações pertinentes. Isso também inclui o envio de confirmações, faturas, avisos técnicos, atualizações, alertas de segurança e mensagens administrativas.
Inferência: Geramos novas informações a partir de outros dados que coletamos para derivar prováveis preferências ou outras características. Por exemplo, deduzimos a sua localização geográfica geral com base no seu endereço IP.
Personalização: Usamos Dados Pessoais para personalizar o Serviço de acordo com suas preferências, para avaliar a eficácia de anúncios comerciais corporativos e comunicações promocionais e para garantir uma experiência de usuário perfeita e consistente.
Segurança e proteção: Para promover a segurança, integridade e proteção em nossos Serviços, processamos Dados Pessoais, usando técnicas automatizadas e, às vezes, manuais para detecção de abuso, prevenção e violações dos termos de serviço.
Prestação de Serviços: Usamos Dados Pessoais para fornecer e atualizar nossos Serviços conforme configurado e usado por Você e para fazer experiências e recomendações personalizadas contínuas.
Solução de problemas: Usamos Dados Pessoais para identificar e resolver problemas técnicos.
Desempenho contínuo do serviço: Os dados pessoais nos ajudam a manter os serviços atualizados e com desempenho e atendem às necessidades de produtividade, confiabilidade, eficácia, qualidade, privacidade, acessibilidade e segurança do usuário.
Cumprir e resolver obrigações legais: incluindo responder a Solicitações de Dados Pessoais do Titular de Dados processados pelo GitHub como Controlador (por exemplo, dados do site), requisitos fiscais, acordos e disputas.
Prestação de Serviços Profissionais: Utilizamos Dados Pessoais para fornecer formação, consultoria ou implementação ("Serviços Profissionais"). Isso inclui fornecer suporte técnico, planejamento profissional, aconselhamento, orientação, migração de dados, implantação e serviços de desenvolvimento de soluções/software.
Melhorar os Serviços Profissionais: Melhorar a entrega, a eficácia, a qualidade e a segurança dos Serviços Profissionais e do(s) produto(s) subjacente(s) com base em problemas identificados durante a prestação de Serviços Profissionais, incluindo a correção de defeitos de software e, de outra forma, manter os Serviços Profissionais atualizados e com desempenho.
Ao realizar essas atividades, o GitHub pratica a minimização de dados e usa a quantidade mínima de Informações Pessoais necessária.
Compartilhamento de Dados Pessoais
Podemos compartilhar Dados Pessoais com os seguintes destinatários:
Entidades de Prevenção de Abuso e Fraude: Podemos divulgar Dados Pessoais com base em uma crença de boa fé que são necessários para evitar fraude, abuso ou ataques aos nossos Serviços, ou para proteger a segurança do GitHub e de nossos usuários.
Afiliados: Os Dados Pessoais podem ser compartilhados com afiliadas do GitHub, incluindo a Microsoft, para facilitar o atendimento ao cliente, marketing e publicidade, atendimento de pedidos, cobrança, suporte técnico e obrigações legais e de conformidade. Nossas afiliadas só podem usar os Dados Pessoais de maneira consistente com esta Declaração de Privacidade.

O GitHub fornecerá a você um aviso sobre o acesso ao repositório privado, a menos que isso seja proibido por lei ou se o GitHub agir em resposta a uma ameaça à segurança ou outro risco à segurança.
Bases legais para o processamento de dados pessoais (aplicáveis aos usuários finais do EEE e do Reino Unido)
O GitHub processa Dados Pessoais em conformidade com o RGPD, garantindo uma base legal para cada atividade de processamento. A base varia dependendo do tipo de dados e do contexto, incluindo como você acessa os serviços. Nossas atividades de processamento normalmente se enquadram nestas bases legais:

Transferências internacionais de dados
O GitHub armazena e processa Dados Pessoais em uma variedade de locais, incluindo sua região local, os Estados Unidos e outros países onde o GitHub, suas afiliadas, subsidiárias ou subprocessadores têm operações. Transferimos Dados Pessoais da União Europeia, do Reino Unido e da Suíça para países que a Comissão Europeia não reconheceu como tendo um nível adequado de proteção de dados. Quando nos envolvemos em tais transferências, geralmente contamos com as cláusulas contratuais padrão publicadas pela Comissão Europeia de acordo com a
Decisão de Execução 2021/914 da Comissão
, para ajudar a proteger seus direitos e permitir que essas proteções viajem com seus dados. Para saber mais sobre as decisões da Comissão Europeia sobre a adequação da proteção dos dados pessoais nos países onde o GitHub processa dados pessoais, consulte este artigo no
site da Comissão Europeia
.
Framework de Privacidade dos Dados (DPF)
O GitHub também está em conformidade com a Framework de Privacidade dos Dados para UE/EUA (DPF para UE/EUA), a Extensão do Reino Unido à DPF para UE/EUA e Framework de Privacidade dos Dados para Suíça/EUA (DPF para Suíça/EUA) conforme estabelecido pelo Departamento de Comércio dos EUA. O GitHub certificou ao Departamento de Comércio dos EUA que adere aos Princípios da Framework de Privacidade dos Dados para UE/EUA (Princípios da DPF para UE/EUA) no que diz respeito ao processamento de dados pessoais recebidos da União Europeia com base no DPF para UE/EUA e do Reino Unido (e Gibraltar) com base na Extensão do Reino Unido à DPF para UE/EUA. O GitHub certificou ao Departamento de Comércio dos EUA que adere aos Princípios da Framework de Privacidade dos Dados para Suíça/EUA (Princípios da DPF para Suíça/EUA)) com relação ao processamento de dados pessoais recebidos da Suíça com base na DPF para Suíça/EUA. Se houver qualquer conflito entre os termos desta política de privacidade e os Princípios da DPF para UE/EUA e/ou os Princípios da DPF para Suíça/EUA. os Princípios prevalecerão. Para saber mais sobre o programa da Framework de Privacidade dos Dados (DPF) e visualizar nossa certificação, acesse
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
O GitHub tem a responsabilidade pelo processamento de Dados Pessoais que recebe nos termos dos Princípios da Framework de Privacidade dos Dados (DPF) e, posteriormente, transfere para um terceiro atuando como agente em nome do GitHub. O GitHub permanecerá responsável de acordo com os Princípios da DPF se o seu agente processar tais Dados Pessoais de maneira inconsistente com os Princípios da DPF, a menos que a organização prove que não é responsável pelo evento que deu origem ao dano.
Processo de resolução de disputas
Em conformidade com o DPF UE-EUA, a extensão do Reino Unido ao DPF UE-EUA e o Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub se compromete a resolver reclamações relacionadas aos Princípios DPF sobre nossa coleta e uso de suas informações pessoais. Indivíduos da UE, Reino Unido e Suíça com consultas ou reclamações sobre o nosso tratamento de dados pessoais recebidos com base no DPF UE-EUA, na Extensão do Reino Unido e na Suíça-EUA. O DPF deve primeiro entrar em contato com o GitHub em: dpo[at]github[dot]com.

Uso que nós fazemos de cookies e tecnologias de rastreamento
Cookies e tecnologias de rastreamento
O GitHub usa cookies para fornecer, proteger e aprimorar nosso Serviço ou para desenvolver novos recursos e funcionalidades de nosso Serviço. Por exemplo, nós os usamos para (i) manter você conectado, (ii) lembrar suas preferências, (iii) identificar seu dispositivo para fins de segurança e de fraude, incluindo o necessário para manter a integridade do seu Serviço, (iv) compilar relatórios estatísticos e (v) fornecer informações e insights para desenvolvimento futuro do GitHub. Fornecemos mais informações sobre
cookies no GitHub
que descrevem os cookies que definimos, as necessidades que temos para esses cookies e a validade de tais cookies.
Para Páginas de Marketing Corporativo, também podemos usar cookies não essenciais para (i) coletar informações sobre os interesses e atividades online dos usuários corporativos para personalizar as experiências deles, inclusive tornando mais relevantes os anúncios, conteúdo, recomendações e marketing vistos ou recebidos e (ii) veicular e medir a eficácia da publicidade direcionada e outros esforços de marketing. Se você desabilitar os cookies não essenciais nas Páginas de Marketing Corporativo, os anúncios, o conteúdo e o marketing que você verá podem ser menos relevantes.
Nossos emails para usuários podem conter uma tag de pixel, que é uma imagem pequena e clara que pode nos dizer se você abriu ou não um email e qual é o endereço IP. Usamos essa tag de pixel para tornar nossas comunicações por email mais eficazes e garantir que não estamos enviando emails indesejados.
O tempo que um cookie permanecerá no seu navegador ou dispositivo depende se ele é um cookie “persistente” ou de “sessão”. Os cookies de sessão só continuarão no seu dispositivo até você parar de navegar. Os cookies persistentes são mantidos até expirarem ou serem excluídos. A data de validade ou período de retenção aplicável aos cookies persistentes depende da finalidade da coleta de cookies e da ferramenta usada. Você pode excluir dados de cookies. Para saber mais, confira
Declaração Geral de Privacidade do GitHub
.
O que são cookies e tecnologias semelhantes?
Usamos cookies e tecnologias semelhantes, como Web beacons, armazenamento local e análise móvel, para operar e fornecer nossos Serviços. Ao visitar as Páginas de Marketing Corporativo, como resources.github.com, esses e cookies adicionais, como IDs de publicidade, podem ser usados para fins de vendas e marketing.
Os cookies são pequenos arquivos de texto armazenados pelo seu navegador no seu dispositivo. Um cookie poderá ser lido posteriormente quando seu navegador se conectar a um servidor Web no mesmo domínio em que o cookie está ativado. O texto em um cookie contém uma cadeia de caracteres de números e letras que podem identificar exclusivamente seu dispositivo e também conter outras informações. Isso permite que o servidor Web reconheça seu navegador ao longo do tempo, sempre que ele se conectar a esse servidor Web.
Web beacons são imagens eletrônicas (também chamadas de "pixel único" ou "GIFs transparentes") contidas em um site ou email. Quando seu navegador abre uma página da Web ou email que contém um Web beacon, ele se conecta automaticamente ao servidor Web que hospeda a imagem (normalmente operado por terceiros). Isso permite que o servidor Web registre informações sobre o seu dispositivo e defina e leia os próprios cookies. Da mesma forma, o conteúdo de terceiros em nossos sites (como vídeos inseridos, plug-ins ou anúncios) faz com que seu navegador se conecte ao servidor Web de terceiros que hospeda esse conteúdo.
Os identificadores móveis para análise podem ser acessados e usados por aplicativos em dispositivos móveis da mesma forma que os sites acessam e usam cookies. Ao visitar as páginas de Marketing Corporativo, como resources.github.com, em um dispositivo móvel, elas podem permitir que nós e nossos parceiros de análise e publicidade de terceiros coletem dados para fins de vendas e marketing.
Também podemos usar os chamados "cookies flash" (também conhecidos como "Objetos Compartilhados Locais" ou "LSOs") para coletar e armazenar informações sobre o uso dos nossos Serviços. Os cookies flash são frequentemente usados para anúncios e vídeos.
Como nós e nossos parceiros usamos cookies e tecnologias semelhantes?
Os Serviços do GitHub usam cookies e tecnologias semelhantes para diversas finalidades, inclusive para armazenar suas preferências e configurações, permitir que você se conecte, analisar o desempenho de nossos Serviços, rastrear sua interação com os Serviços, desenvolver inferências, combater fraudes e cumprir outros fins legítimos. Alguns desses cookies e tecnologias podem ser fornecidos por terceiros, incluindo provedores de serviços e parceiros de publicidade. Por exemplo, nossos parceiros de análise e publicidade podem usar essas tecnologias em nossos Serviços para coletar informações pessoais (como as páginas que você visita, os links em que clica e informações de uso semelhantes, identificadores e informações do dispositivo) relacionadas às suas atividades online ao longo do tempo e nos Serviços para vários fins, incluindo publicidade direcionada. O GitHub colocará cookies não essenciais em páginas nas quais comercializamos produtos e serviços para clientes corporativos, por exemplo, em resources.github.com.
Nós e/ou nossos parceiros também compartilhamos as informações que coletamos ou inferimos com terceiros para esses fins.
A tabela abaixo fornece informações adicionais sobre como usamos diferentes tipos de cookies:
Finalidade
Descrição
Cookies obrigatórios
O GitHub usa cookies obrigatórios para executar funções essenciais do site e fornecer os serviços. Por exemplo, os cookies são usados para fazer logon, salvar suas preferências de idioma, fornecer uma experiência de carrinho de compras, aprimorar o desempenho, rotear o tráfego entre servidores Web, detectar o tamanho da tela, determinar os tempos de carregamento da página, aprimorar a experiência do usuário e para avaliação do público-alvo. Esses cookies são necessários para que nossos sites funcionem.
Análise
Permitimos que terceiros usem cookies de análise para entender como você usa nossos sites a fim de melhorá-los. Por exemplo, os cookies são usados para coletar informações sobre as páginas que você visita e quantos cliques você precisa para realizar uma tarefa. Também usamos alguns cookies de análise para fornecer publicidade personalizada.
Mídia social
O GitHub e terceiros usam cookies de mídia social para mostrar anúncios e conteúdo com base em seus perfis de mídia social e atividades nos sites do GitHub. Isso garante que os anúncios e o conteúdo que você vê em nossos sites e nas mídias sociais reflitam melhor seus interesses. Isso também permite que terceiros desenvolvam e aprimorem os produtos, que podem ser usados em sites que não são de propriedade ou operados pelo GitHub.
Publicidade
Além disso, o GitHub e terceiros usam cookies de publicidade para mostrar novos anúncios com base em anúncios que você já viu. Os cookies também rastreiam em quais anúncios você clica ou as compras que você faz depois de clicar em um anúncio. Isso é feito tanto para fins de pagamento quanto para exibir anúncios mais relevantes para você. Por exemplo, os cookies são usados para detectar quando você clica em um anúncio e para mostrar anúncios com base em seus interesses de mídia social e histórico de navegação no site.
Quais são suas opções de cookie e controles?
Você tem várias opções para desabilitar cookies não essenciais:
Especialmente em Páginas de Marketing Corporativo do GitHub
Qualquer página do GitHub que veicule cookies não essenciais terá um link no rodapé da página para as configurações de cookies. Você pode expressar suas preferências a qualquer momento clicando nesse link e atualizando suas configurações.
Alguns usuários também poderão gerenciar cookies não essenciais por meio de um banner de consentimento de cookies, incluindo as opções para aceitar, gerenciar e rejeitar todos os cookies não essenciais.
Geralmente para todos os sites
Você pode controlar os cookies que encontra na Web usando uma variedade de ferramentas amplamente disponíveis. Por exemplo:
Se o seu navegador enviar um sinal

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center
.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account
. Stripe offers a service called "Link," which allows you to create an account and store information for future interactions with Stripe’s Services and Business Users. You may save a number of different kinds of Personal Data using Link. For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.
Learn More
.
You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe
. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.
Learn More
.

. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Users, including about your online activity and your engagement with our End User Services, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data

b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Users
Services
. We use and share your Personal Data to provide the End User Services to you, which includes support, personalization (such as language preferences and setting choices), and communication about our End User Services (such as communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, Stripe may use cookies and similar technologies or the data you provide to our Business Users (such as when you input your email address on a Business User’s website) to recognize you and help you use Link when visiting our Business User’s website. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies in Stripe’s
Cookie Policy

Our Business Users.
When you use Link to make payments with our Business Users, we share your Personal Data, including name, contact information, payment method details, and Transaction Data with those Business Users.
Learn More
. You can also direct Stripe to share your saved bank account information and identity documents with Business Users you do business with. Once we share your Personal Data with Business Users, we may process that Personal Data as a Data Processor for those Business Users, as detailed in Section 1.2 of this Policy.  You should consult the privacy policies of the Business Users’ you do business with for information on how they use the information shared with them.
Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention
. We use your Personal Data collected across our Services to detect fraud and prevent financial losses for you, us, and our Business Users and Financial Partners, including detecting unauthorized purchases. We may provide Business Users and Financial Partners, including those that use our fraud prevention-related Business Services (such as Stripe Radar), with Personal Data about you (including your attempted transactions) so that they can assess the fraud or loss risk associated with the transaction. Learn more about how we may use technology to assess the fraud risk associated with an attempted transaction and what information we share with Business Users and Financial Partners

Advertising
. Where permitted by applicable law, we may use your Personal Data, including Transaction Data, to assess your eligibility for, and offer you, other End User Services or promote existing End User Services, including through co-marketing with partners such as Stripe Business Users.
Learn more
. Subject to applicable law, including any consent requirements, we use and share End User Personal Data with third party partners to allow us to advertise our End User Services to you, including through interest-based advertising, and to track the efficacy of such ads. We do not transfer your Personal Data to third parties in exchange for payment, but we may provide your data to third-party partners, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our Services to you.
Learn more

More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center
, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing your Personal Data.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Customers
Transaction Data
. If you're an End Customer making payments to, receiving refunds or payments from, initiating a purchase or donation, or otherwise transacting with our Business User, whether in-person or online, we receive your Transaction Data. We may also receive your transaction history with the Business User.
Learn More
. Additionally, we may collect information entered into a checkout form even if you opt not to complete the form or transaction with the Business User.
Learn More
. A Business User who uses Stripe’s Terminal Service to provide its goods or services to End Customers may use the Terminal Service to collect End Customer Personal Data (like your name, email, phone number, address, signature, or age) in accordance with its own privacy policy.
Identity/Verification Information
. Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.
Learn More
.
More
. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Customers, including about your online activity, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers
To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them. Where allowed, we also use End Customers' Personal Data for Stripe’s own purposes such as enhancing security, improving and offering our Business Services, and preventing fraud, loss, and other damages, as described further below.
Payment processing and accounting
. We use your Transaction Data to deliver Payment-related Business Services to Business Users — including online payment transactions processing, sales tax calculation, and invoice, bill, and dispute handling — and to help them determine their revenue, settle their bills, and execute accounting tasks.
Learn More
. We may also use your Personal Data to provide and improve our Business Services.
During payment transactions, your Personal Data is shared with various entities in connection with your transaction. As a service provider or data processor, we share Personal Data to enable transactions as directed by Business Users. For instance, when you choose a payment method for your transaction, we may share your Transaction Data with your bank or other payment method provider, including as necessary to authenticate you, Learn More, process your transaction, prevent fraud, and handle disputes. The Business User you choose to do business with also receives Transaction Data and might share the data with others. Please review your merchant’s, bank’s, and payment method provider’s privacy policies for more information about how they use and share your Personal Data.
Financial services
. Certain Business Users leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via Stripe or our Financial Partners. For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User. In addition to any Transaction Data we may generate or receive when these cards are used for purchases, we also collect and use your Personal Data to provide and manage these products, including assisting our Business Users in preventing misuse of the cards. Please review the privacy policies of the Business User and, if applicable, our bank partners associated with the financial service (the brands of which may be shown on the card) for more information.
Identity/Verification services
. We use Personal Data about your identity to perform verification services for Stripe or for the Business Users that you are transacting with, to prevent fraud, and to enhance security. For these purposes we may use Personal Data you provide directly or Personal Data we obtain from our service providers, including for phone verification.
Learn More
. If you provide a selfie along with an image of your identity document, we may employ biometric technology to compare and calculate whether they match and verify your identity.
Learn More

Our Business Users (and their authorized third parties).
We share End Customers' Personal Data with their respective Business Users and parties directly authorized by those Business Users to receive such data. Here are common examples of such sharing:
When a Business User instructs Stripe to provide another Business User with access to its Stripe account, including data related to its End Customers, via Stripe Connect.
Sharing information that you have provided to us with a Business User so that we can send payments to you on behalf of that Business User.
Sharing information, documents, or images provided by an End Customer with a Business User when the latter uses Stripe Identity, our identity verification Service, to verify the identity of the End Customer.
The Business Users you choose to do business with may further share your Personal Data with third parties (like additional third party service providers other than Stripe). Please review the Business User’s privacy policy for more information.
Advertising by Business Users
. If you initiate a purchasing process with a Business User, the Business User receives your Personal Data from us in connection with our provision of Services even if you don't finish your purchase. The Business User may use your Personal Data to market and advertise their products or services, subject to the terms of their privacy policy. Please review the Business User’s privacy policy for more information, including your rights to stop their use of your Personal Data for marketing purposes.

What we do
How does Stripe protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse we use security measures to comply with federal law.  These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.  We impose access controls along with ongoing monitoring to prevent data misuse, and we require our service providers to take similar steps to protect your information.
How does Stripe collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
• open a Link account;
• ask Stripe to process a payment for goods or services;
• provide bank account information to Stripe using Financial Connections
We also collect your personal information from others, such as affiliates or other companies.
Why can’t I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
• sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
• affiliates from using your information to market to you
• sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you.
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See the Other Important Information section below for more information on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.
