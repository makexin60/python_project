Cookies, Pixels, and Other Internet Technologies
We, as well as certain third parties, including those that provide content and other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixels (i.e., through a Meta/Facebook pixel), web beacons and other similar technologies on our online Services (referred to collectively as “Cookies”) and the information collected from such technologies. We also share information about your use of our websites with third parties, including our social media, advertising, and analytics partners. For more information on the
information we collect through the use of Cookies, and how we use the information we collect, please see the
Information We Collect
and
Use of Information
sections of this Privacy Policy. For more information regarding third-party use of cookies, pixels, web beacons, and other similar technologies on our websites, please see the
Third Parties That Provide Content or Functionality on Our Services
section of this Privacy Policy. By using our online Services, you are consenting to our use of tracking technologies as described in this Privacy Policy.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file that may be stored on your computer or other device. A cookie enables the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize it across different websites and services.
When you use a web browser to access the Services, you may configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Click the “Help” menu of your browser to learn more about how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies. Please note that disabling cookies may affect your ability to access and use certain features of the Services.
Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates. There is no industry standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. Sherwin-Williams currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard is established and accepted, Sherwin-Williams may revisit its policy on responding to these signals. If you are a U.S. user,

for information about Do-Not-Track signals and similar mechanisms.
Tracking Pixels and Web Beacons
Pixels, web beacons, and similar technologies are small bits of code, which are embedded in web pages, ads, and e-mail, that communicate with third parties. We may use pixels, for example, to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page, to deliver or communicate with cookies, and to understand usage patterns. We also may include pixels in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
Other Technologies
There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use “SDKs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices. SDKs are blocks of code that may be installed in our mobile application by third party companies with which we work. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile application and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access our application, such as the advertising identifier associated with your device and information about how you interact with our application.
How We Use These Technologies
Our online Services use these technologies for the following general purposes:
Type of Cookie
What Do They Do
Examples
Required
Enable our online Service to work correctly.
For example, these Cookies remember previous actions (e.g., entered text) when navigating back to a page in the same session and balance website traffic.
Performance
Help us measure and understand how visitors interact with the online Services, our content, and any issues encountered to help us improve the performance of the Services.
For example, these Cookies gain insight into how visitors use our websites so we can make improvements to usability and content.
Functionality
Allow our online Services to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) to provide a more personalized online experience.
For example, these Cookies may enable you to store your sign-in credentials and preferences so that you don’t have to enter those credentials and preferences each time you log on.
Targeting/Advertising
Help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and online services.
These Cookies may be used to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement.  They also help us measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. We may include pixels in e-mails, for example, to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
Cookies vary in how long they last. “Session Cookies” terminate shortly after you terminate your internet session. “Persistent Cookies” are stored on your device until a set expiration date. We use both Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies on our websites.

Third Parties That Provide Content or Functionality on Our Services
Some of the content and functionality on our Services is provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us.

These and other third parties collect or receive certain information about your use of our Services, including through the use of Cookies, pixels, and similar technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected across different websites and online services.
Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising. Please visit the websites operated by the
Network Advertising Initiative

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (California Civil Code Section 1798.100, et seq.), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (California Civil Code Section 1798.100, et seq.) (“
CCPA
”), California residents have certain rights they may exercise either independently or through an authorized agent. Your California privacy rights are described below. For purposes of this Notice, in some places we have abbreviated or summarized CCPA terms or language. Terms defined under the CCPA that are used in this Notice shall have the same meanings as under the CCPA.
To make a request to delete, request to correct, or request to know, you can submit a case through our
Global Privacy Portal
or by calling 1-844-835-4134. Please follow the instructions on our
Global Privacy Portal
and promptly respond to any follow-up inquires so that we may confirm your identity. If you would like to opt out of sales and sharing of PI, click the Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information link on the homepage of the Sherwin-Williams website(s) you visit and move the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information / Targeting Cookies” toggle to “off”.
If you submit a request to know, request to delete or request to correct, you will be asked to log into your account or to provide 2-3 pieces of PI that we will match against our records to verify your identity. Authorized Agents may submit requests on behalf of Consumers by following these steps and providing appropriate documentation. If you submit a request through an authorized agent, you will still need to verify your identity directly with us before your request can be processed.
Right to Know
You have the right to request that we provide you with the following information. Requests of this nature may be made no more than twice in a 12-month period.
The categories of PI we have collected about you, including:
The categories of sources from which the PI was collected
Our business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing PI
The categories of third parties to which we disclose PI
The categories of PI that we sold, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to which we sold that particular category of PI
The categories of PI that we disclosed for a business purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of recipients to which we disclosed that particular category of PI
The specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.
Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing of PI
You have the right to opt out of the sale of your PI, and to request that we do not share your PI for cross-context behavioral advertising. Although we do not sell Personal Information in exchange for money, some of the ways in which we share PI for advertising or marketing may be considered “sales” or “sharing” under the CCPA. To opt-out, please click on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on the homepage of the Sherwin-Williams website(s) you visit and move the indicated toggle to “off.” If you choose to use a browser-based opt-out signal (such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC)), you will be opted out of cookie-based sales and sharing of Personal Information for each of our websites you visit with the signal enabled. Because we are unable to recognize you across different websites, visiting one of our sites with the signal enabled will have the effect of opting you out of sales and sharing with respect to that specific site, but will not impact sales and sharing for our other websites. Additionally, you will need to turn on the opt-out signal for each browser that you use. Please note that the GPC signal may block our websites’ cookie banners and preference centers from appearing or otherwise interfere with our Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information links. If this occurs, your preferences have been recognized, even if the banner and preference center are no longer visible.
Deletion Rights
You may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you. Under the CCPA, we may decline to delete your PI under certain circumstances—for example, if we need the PI to complete transactions or provide services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, to comply with law, or to exercise or defend legal claims. Where we use deidentification to satisfy a deletion request, we commit to maintaining and using the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information.
Correction Rights
If you believe that PI we maintain about you is inaccurate, you have the right to request that we correct that information.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
We do not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes to which the right to limit use and disclosure applies under the CCPA.
Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights
If you choose to exercise any of your privacy rights under the CCPA, you also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us.

Cookies, Pixels, and Other Internet Technologies
We, as well as certain third parties, including those that provide content and other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixels (i.e., through a Meta/Facebook pixel), web beacons and other similar technologies on our online Services (referred to collectively as “Cookies”) and the information collected from such technologies. We also share information about your use of our websites with third parties, including our social media, advertising, and analytics partners. For more information on the
information we collect through the use of Cookies, and how we use the information we collect, please see the
Information We Collect
and
Use of Information
sections of this Privacy Policy. For more information regarding third-party use of cookies, pixels, web beacons, and other similar technologies on our websites, please see the
Third Parties That Provide Content or Functionality on Our Services
section of this Privacy Policy. By using our online Services, you are consenting to our use of tracking technologies as described in this Privacy Policy.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file that may be stored on your computer or other device. A cookie enables the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize it across different websites and services.
When you use a web browser to access the Services, you may configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Click the “Help” menu of your browser to learn more about how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies. Please note that disabling cookies may affect your ability to access and use certain features of the Services.
Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates. There is no industry standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. Sherwin-Williams currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard is established and accepted, Sherwin-Williams may revisit its policy on responding to these signals. If you are a U.S. user,
click here
for information about Do-Not-Track signals and similar mechanisms.
Tracking Pixels and Web Beacons
Pixels, web beacons, and similar technologies are small bits of code, which are embedded in web pages, ads, and e-mail, that communicate with third parties. We may use pixels, for example, to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page, to deliver or communicate with cookies, and to understand usage patterns. We also may include pixels in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
Other Technologies
There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use “SDKs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices. SDKs are blocks of code that may be installed in our mobile application by third party companies with which we work. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile application and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access our application, such as the advertising identifier associated with your device and information about how you interact with our application.
How We Use These Technologies
Our online Services use these technologies for the following general purposes:
Type of Cookie
What Do They Do
Examples
Required
Enable our online Service to work correctly.
For example, these Cookies remember previous actions (e.g., entered text) when navigating back to a page in the same session and balance website traffic.
Performance
Help us measure and understand how visitors interact with the online Services, our content, and any issues encountered to help us improve the performance of the Services.
For example, these Cookies gain insight into how visitors use our websites so we can make improvements to usability and content.
Functionality
Allow our online Services to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) to provide a more personalized online experience.
For example, these Cookies may enable you to store your sign-in credentials and preferences so that you don’t have to enter those credentials and preferences each time you log on.
Targeting/Advertising
Help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and online services.
These Cookies may be used to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement.  They also help us measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. We may include pixels in e-mails, for example, to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
Cookies vary in how long they last. “Session Cookies” terminate shortly after you terminate your internet session. “Persistent Cookies” are stored on your device until a set expiration date. We use both Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies on our websites.

Third Parties That Provide Content or Functionality on Our Services
Some of the content and functionality on our Services is provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. For example, we enable you to share certain materials on our Services through social networking services, such as Facebook and Twitter. These and other social networking services may automatically collect information from or about your use of our Services when you use our Services while logged into the social networking services. We also offer online chat features that are supported by vendors - when you use these features, you are sharing information you provide in the chat with the vendor as well as with us. Third-party advertisers, including but not limited to session replay vendors and social media services, also may have a presence on some of our Services. These and other third parties collect or receive certain information about your use of our Services, including through the use of Cookies, pixels, and similar technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected across different websites and online services.
Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising. Please visit the websites operated by the
Network Advertising Initiative
and
Digital Advertising Alliance
to learn more. (Canadian users may also visit the website operated by the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada. Further information in local languages may be available at that site.)
Our Services, including our websites, use analytics technology provided by Google Analytics to understand how users interact with the sites, improve our web experience, and better market our products. You may exercise choices regarding the use of Cookies from Google Analytics by going to

Authorized Agents may submit requests on behalf of Consumers by following these steps and providing appropriate documentation. If you submit a request through an authorized agent, you will still need to verify your identity directly with us before your request can be processed.
Right to Know
You have the right to request that we provide you with the following information. Requests of this nature may be made no more than twice in a 12-month period.
The categories of PI we have collected about you, including:
The categories of sources from which the PI was collected
Our business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing PI
The categories of third parties to which we disclose PI
The categories of PI that we sold, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to which we sold that particular category of PI
The categories of PI that we disclosed for a business purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of recipients to which we disclosed that particular category of PI
The specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.
Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing of PI
You have the right to opt out of the sale of your PI, and to request that we do not share your PI for cross-context behavioral advertising. Although we do not sell Personal Information in exchange for money, some of the ways in which we share PI for advertising or marketing may be considered “sales” or “sharing” under the CCPA. To opt-out, please click on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on the homepage of the Sherwin-Williams website(s) you visit and move the indicated toggle to “off.” If you choose to use a browser-based opt-out signal (such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC)), you will be opted out of cookie-based sales and sharing of Personal Information for each of our websites you visit with the signal enabled. Because we are unable to recognize you across different websites, visiting one of our sites with the signal enabled will have the effect of opting you out of sales and sharing with respect to that specific site, but will not impact sales and sharing for our other websites. Additionally, you will need to turn on the opt-out signal for each browser that you use. Please note that the GPC signal may block our websites’ cookie banners and preference centers from appearing or otherwise interfere with our Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information links. If this occurs, your preferences have been recognized, even if the banner and preference center are no longer visible.
Deletion Rights
You may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you. Under the CCPA, we may decline to delete your PI under certain circumstances—for example, if we need the PI to complete transactions or provide services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, to comply with law, or to exercise or defend legal claims. Where we use deidentification to satisfy a deletion request, we commit to maintaining and using the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information.
Correction Rights
If you believe that PI we maintain about you is inaccurate, you have the right to request that we correct that information.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
We do not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes to which the right to limit use and disclosure applies under the CCPA.
Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights
If you choose to exercise any of your privacy rights under the CCPA, you also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us.
