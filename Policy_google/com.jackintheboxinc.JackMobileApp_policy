ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CALLING JACK IN THE BOX’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT 1-800-378-5225. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT JACK IN THE BOX’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE YOUR CONCERNS, WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. JACK IN THE BOX WILL PAY ALL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATOR EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS OR BROUGHT IN BAD FAITH. HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.
(a)
Arbitration Agreement.
Jack in the Box and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between us arising out of or relating to this Arbitration Agreement (“Agreement”), use of the Services, or products, services, or programs you purchase or enroll in via the Services including through the Mobile App, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, any dispute you or we may have relating to copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property shall not be governed by this agreement to arbitrate. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that any claims you or we may have relating to intellectual property rights against the other, including seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Agreement otherwise includes, but is not limited to: claims based in contract, tort, warranty, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; claims relating to our websites; claims arising out of or relating to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; claims relating to your data privacy or information security; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, references to “Jack in the Box,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products, or information provided or made available under this or prior agreements between us relating to or arising from any aspect of your use or access of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Jack in the Box are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Jack in the Box for any reason.
(b)
Written Notice of Dispute.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Jack in the Box should be addressed to: General Counsel – Arbitration Demand, Jack in the Box, 9357 Spectrum Center Blvd., San Diego, CA 92123 (“Notice Address”) and must be signed by you personally. Notice to you from Jack in the Box may be to you directly, or if you are represented, to your legal counsel. The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Jack in the Box and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Jack in the Box may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
(c)
Filing Fees.
After Jack in the Box receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. The filing fee currently is $225 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The AAA Rules may change from time to time, and you should review them periodically.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement’s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. However, if putative class or representative claims are initially brought by either party in a court of law, and a motion to compel arbitration is brought by any party, then the court shall decide whether this Agreement permits class or representative proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt, the court and arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including with regard to the class and representative waiver provision. In any arbitration, the arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit manifest errors of law or legal reasoning, and any award rendered by the arbitrator that employs a manifest error of law or legal reasoning may be vacated or corrected by a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.
Unless Jack in the Box and you agree otherwise, any arbitration will be governed by the substantive laws of your state, and hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing or registered address subject to certain exceptions herein. Case management and other hearings shall be heard via telephone unless otherwise agreed to. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Jack in the Box will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Jack in the Box for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Jack in the Box or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Jack in the Box are entitled. In arbitration, and to the extent otherwise permitted by law, the parties may exchange “offers of compromise” or stipulate to judgments or awards in the same way the parties could in court, including for example, under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 for arbitrations taking place in California. Such offers of compromise shall have the same force and effect as they would in a court proceeding. The arbitration proceedings shall otherwise remain confidential, except for purposes of seeking court intervention (if necessary).
(d)
Discovery.
Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
(e)
No Class Action Matters.
YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Further, unless both you and Jack in the Box agree otherwise, the arbitrator or arbitration administrator may not consolidate or aggregate more than one person’s claims (except as set forth in subparagraph (f) below), and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of subparagraph (e) enforced. Any claims or causes of action seeking relief not subject to individual arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of individual arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing in subparagraph (e) or (f) below shall prevent you or Jack in the Box from participating in a class wide settlement of claims.
(f)
Mass Arbitration.
YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX AGREE THAT ADMINISTRATION OF ANY MASS, COLLECTIVE, OR BATCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS SUBPARAGRAPH (F).
For the purposes of this Agreement, “Mass Arbitration” means 25 or more arbitration demands that: (i) are filed within 180 days of each other, (ii) allege similar or identical claims or causes of action, and (iii) either (a) the parties to those arbitration demands seek to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate together, or (b) are filed by the same counsel or in coordination with each other.
In the event that Mass Arbitration is attempted or sought involving 250 arbitration demands or less, you and Jack in the Box agree the arbitration provider shall: (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no less than 25 arbitration demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. In the event that Mass Arbitration is attempted or sought involving over 250 arbitration demands, you and Jack in the Box agree that the arbitration provider shall: (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no less than 250 arbitration demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. All Mass Arbitration shall be subject to all other substantive and procedural terms contained within this Agreement.
You and Jack in the Box agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the aforementioned protocol for Mass Arbitration with regard to resolution, fees, and administration. To the extent a dispute arises regarding the administration of a Mass Arbitration, including, but not limited to, whether any conditions precedent have been satisfied or the advancement of fees, you and Jack in the Box agree to the appointment of a Process Arbitrator pursuant to the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules of the AAA.
If any part of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion shall be stricken, and the remainder of this subparagraph (f) and this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.
If the arbitration provider is unwilling or unable to follow the procedures set forth in this subparagraph (f) with regard to Mass Arbitration, the parties may attempt to retain a different, mutually agreeable and widely-recognized arbitration organization that will agree to follow the procedures set forth in this this subparagraph (f). In the event that the parties are unable to retain or agree to such an alternative arbitration provider, the alternative dispute resolution provisions set forth in these Terms shall not apply to those demands within the Mass Arbitration.
If this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this Agreement shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of the Agreement enforced.
(g)
Agreement Modifications.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Jack in the Box makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) after your enrollment in a service or program or your use of the Services, you may reject any such change and require Jack in the Box to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time of your enrollment or purchase if a dispute between us arises, by providing Notice to Jack in the Box at the Notice Address in subparagraph (b) above within 30 days of such change.
MISCELLANEOUS
Governing Law.
You and Jack in the Box agree that your access to the Services and these Terms will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of California, United States of America, Planet Earth, notwithstanding any principles of conflict of law, except for the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver provision above. Any dispute that is not subject to the Arbitration Agreement or cannot be heard in a small claims court shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in San Diego County, California.

No waiver by Jack in the Box of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition, and any failure by Jack in the Box to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, or removed from the Terms, and except as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver Section, all other parts of these Terms are still valid and enforceable. The parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of these Terms with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the fullest extent possible, the economic, business, and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.

Modifications take effect as soon as they are posted to the Services, delivered to you, or reasonably made available to you in writing by Jack in the Box, via e-mail, text messaging, or otherwise. However, no unilateral amendment will retroactively modify the parties’ agreed-to Arbitration Agreement of these Terms for then-pending disputes, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. In all other respects, any modification or update to the Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by subparagraph (g) of the Arbitration Agreement above. Your continued use of the Services after any change in these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such change.

Right to Know/Access
: You have the right to know about and access personal information collected, disclosed, shared, or sold about you. Specifically, you have the right to request information about the categories of personal information we have collected about you, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the categories of third parties with whom we disclose, sell, or share such information.

section.
Sale or Share of Personal Information
Within the last twelve (12) months, we have disclosed certain categories of information to third parties who provide services to us in connection with our marketing efforts. Some of these third parties may retain rights to use this data for their own purposes. While this may not be deemed a sale of personal information in the traditional sense, this disclosure of information with these third-party providers may be deemed a “sale” of personal information under CCPA.

This includes data relating to internet or other similar network activity, commercial information, geolocation data, identifiers, and information under the California Customer Records statute, such as email address, mobile phone number, whether you use our mobile application or your zip code, purchase and transactional history (including dates and items purchase), and whether you have registered an account with us. This information may be provided to companies which help us target advertisements and in our other digital marketing efforts.
To opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, please submit a request using our Jack in the Box
Privacy Portal

Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It
section above.
We collect, use, and disclose this sensitive personal information as necessary to provide the Services, as reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests such Services, and for other permissible business purposes under the CCPA.
We do not “sell” or “share” your sensitive personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA.
Retention of Personal Information
We retain each category of personal information, including sensitive personal information, for the length of time that is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to prevent fraud, and to enforce our agreements. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the nature of the use of our Services, your general relationship with us, the impact on our ability to provide you Services if we delete your personal information, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations, and our use of your personal information for aggregated market research.
Notice of Financial Incentive
We provide financial incentives to consumers who allow us to collect and retain personal information (e.g., name, phone number, and email address) and/or commercial information (e.g., purchase history). These incentives may result in differences in our prices or services offered to consumers and may include payments to consumers (e.g., free food) and/or a lower price for goods and services (e.g., discounts and other promotions).
The financial incentives we may provide include:
The Jack Pack loyalty program, whereby consumers can earn rewards credits based upon their purchases;
Discounts or free products for frequent visitors; and
Periodic promotional discounts and other offers.
The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms and/or in the details of the incentive offer.
Please note that participating in any financial incentive program is entirely optional and participants may withdraw from the program at any time. To opt-out of the program and forgo any ongoing incentives, please follow the instructions in the program’s terms and conditions or contact us using the contact information below.
Each financial incentive or price or service difference related to the collection and use of personal information is based upon our reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business, which takes into consideration the value of the offer itself and the anticipated revenue generation that may be realized by rewarding brand loyalty and repeat purchases. We calculate the value of the offer and financial incentive by using the expense related to the offer.

For example, a purchase of $4.01 to $4.49 would earn 4 points, while a purchase of $4.50 to $4.99 would earn 5 points. Points are earned based on the actual purchase price of qualifying menu items after the application of any coupons or other discounts. Points are not earned for tips, delivery charges, taxes, or any additional fees. Points are not transferable.
We reserve the right to exclude any menu items from the program in our sole discretion.
Jack Pack® participants begin to accumulate points only once they’ve joined the Jack Pack®. No points will be awarded for any purchases made at a store or via the Mobile App or the Website prior to joining the Jack Pack® Program. Additional opportunities to earn points may be offered in the future at our discretion.
Jack Pack® participants can use points to redeem rewards on future purchases using the Mobile App or the Website while signed into their Jack Pack® account. Rewards are accepted by participating Jack in the Box® restaurants. A reward may not be redeemed on its own and requires one additional food or drink item in the same order. Only one reward may be applied per transaction, and rewards are not valid with any other offer or deals.
POINT BALANCE AND EXPIRATION
We reserve the right to determine and modify the amount of points in any participant’s account based on our internal records. All points earned as a result of your participation in the Jack Pack® will expire if a participant’s account is inactive at any time for a period of three hundred and sixty-five (365) consecutive days. No cash or credit shall be given for any expired or unused points. Points that accrue in a participant’s account are not transferable, including via sale, barter, assignment, bequest, inheritance, divorce, property settlement, or other domestic court action, and are subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
PROMOTIONAL ONLY
The points awarded in connection with the Jack Pack® are purely promotional and do not have any cash value. Moreover, these points do not constitute the property of any participant, and cannot be redeemed for cash or gift cards.

ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CALLING JACK IN THE BOX’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT 1-800-378-5225. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT JACK IN THE BOX’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE YOUR CONCERNS, WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. JACK IN THE BOX WILL PAY ALL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATOR EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS OR BROUGHT IN BAD FAITH. HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.
(a)
Arbitration Agreement.
Jack in the Box and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between us arising out of or relating to this Arbitration Agreement (“Agreement”) and use of or participation in the Jack Pack®, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, any dispute you or we may have relating to copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property shall not be governed by this agreement to arbitrate. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that any claims you or we may have relating to intellectual property rights against the other, including seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Agreement otherwise includes, but is not limited to: claims based in contract, tort, warranty, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; claims relating to our websites; claims arising out of or relating to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; claims relating to your data privacy or information security; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, references to “Jack in the Box,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products, or information provided or made available under this or prior agreements between us relating to or arising from any aspect of your use of or access to the Jack Pack®. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Jack in the Box are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Jack in the Box for any reason.
(b)
Notice of Dispute.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Jack in the Box should be addressed to: General Counsel – Arbitration Demand, Jack in the Box, 9357 Spectrum Center Blvd., San Diego, CA 92123 (“Notice Address”) and must be signed by you personally. Notice to you from Jack in the Box may be sent to you directly, or if you are represented, to your legal counsel. The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Jack in the Box and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Jack in the Box may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
(c)
Filing Fees.
After Jack in the Box receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. The filing fee currently is $225 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The AAA Rules may change from time to time, and you should review them periodically.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement’s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. However, if putative class or representative claims are initially brought by either party in a court of law, and a motion to compel arbitration is brought by any party, then the court shall decide whether this Agreement permits class or representative proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt, the court and arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including with regard to the class and representative waiver provision. In any arbitration, the arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit manifest errors of law or legal reasoning, and any award rendered by the arbitrator that employs a manifest error of law or legal reasoning may be vacated or corrected by a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.
Unless Jack in the Box and you agree otherwise, any arbitration will be governed by the substantive laws of your state, and hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing or registered address subject to certain exceptions herein. Case management and other hearings shall be heard via telephone unless otherwise agreed to. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Jack in the Box will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Jack in the Box for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Jack in the Box or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Jack in the Box are entitled. In arbitration, and to the extent otherwise permitted by law, the parties may exchange “offers of compromise” or stipulate to judgments or awards in the same way the parties could in court, including for example, under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 for arbitrations taking place in California. Such offers of compromise shall have the same force and effect as they would in a court proceeding. The arbitration proceedings shall otherwise remain confidential, except for purposes of seeking court intervention (if necessary).
(d)
Discovery.
Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
(e)
No Class Action Matters.
YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Further, unless both you and Jack in the Box agree otherwise, the arbitrator or arbitration administrator may not consolidate or aggregate more than one person’s claims (except as set forth in subparagraph (f) below), and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of subparagraph (e) enforced. Any claims or causes of action seeking relief not subject to individual arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of individual arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing in subparagraph (e) or (f) below shall prevent you or Jack in the Box from participating in a class wide settlement of claims.
(f)
Mass Arbitration.
YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX AGREE THAT ADMINISTRATION OF ANY MASS, COLLECTIVE, OR BATCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS SUBPARAGRAPH (F).
For the purposes of this Agreement, “Mass Arbitration” means 25 or more arbitration demands that: (i) are filed within 180 days of each other, (ii) allege similar or identical claims or causes of action, and (iii) either (a) the parties to those arbitration demands seek to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate together, or (b) are filed by the same counsel or in coordination with each other.
In the event that Mass Arbitration is attempted or sought involving 250 arbitration demands or less, you and Jack in the Box agree the arbitration provider shall: (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no less than 25 arbitration demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. In the event that Mass Arbitration is attempted or sought involving over 250 arbitration demands, you and Jack in the Box agree that the arbitration provider shall: (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no less than 250 arbitration demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. All Mass Arbitration shall be subject to all other substantive and procedural terms contained within this Agreement.
You and Jack in the Box agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the aforementioned protocol for Mass Arbitration with regard to resolution, fees, and administration. To the extent a dispute arises regarding the administration of a Mass Arbitration, including, but not limited to, whether any conditions precedent have been satisfied or the advancement of fees, you and Jack in the Box agree to the appointment of a Process Arbitrator pursuant to the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules of the AAA.
If any part of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion shall be stricken, and the remainder of this subparagraph (f) and this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.
If the arbitration provider is unwilling or unable to follow the procedures set forth in this subparagraph (f) with regard to Mass Arbitration, the parties may attempt to retain a different, mutually agreeable and widely-recognized arbitration organization that will agree to follow the procedures set forth in this this subparagraph (f). In the event that the parties are unable to retain or agree to such an alternative arbitration provider, the alternative dispute resolution provisions set forth in these Terms shall not apply to those demands within the Mass Arbitration.
If this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this Agreement shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of the Agreement enforced.
(g)
Agreement Modifications.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Jack in the Box makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) after your enrollment in the Jack Pack® Program, you may reject any such change and require Jack in the Box to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time of your enrollment if a dispute between us arises, by providing Notice to Jack in the Box at the Notice Address in subparagraph (b) above within thirty (30) days of such change.
GOVERNING LAW
Any dispute arising from these Jack Pack® Terms of Use or your access to and/or participation in the Jack Pack® Program shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to any conflict of law rules or principles, except for the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver provision above. Any dispute that is not subject to the Arbitration Agreement or cannot be heard in a small claims court shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in San Diego County, California.
SEVERABILITY AND NO WAIVER
No waiver by Jack in the Box of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition, and any failure by Jack in the Box to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any portion of these Jack Pack® Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, or removed from the Terms, and except as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver Section, all other parts of these Terms are still valid and enforceable. The parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of these Terms with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the fullest extent possible, the economic, business, and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.

ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CALLING JACK IN THE BOX’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT 1-800-378-5225. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT JACK IN THE BOX’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE YOUR CONCERNS, WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. JACK IN THE BOX WILL PAY ALL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATOR EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS OR BROUGHT IN BAD FAITH. HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.
(a)
Arbitration Agreement.
Jack in the Box and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between us arising out of or relating to this Arbitration Agreement (“Agreement”), use of the Services, or products, services, or programs you purchase or enroll in via the Services including through the Mobile App, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, any dispute you or we may have relating to copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property shall not be governed by this agreement to arbitrate. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that any claims you or we may have relating to intellectual property rights against the other, including seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Agreement otherwise includes, but is not limited to: claims based in contract, tort, warranty, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; claims relating to our websites; claims arising out of or relating to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; claims relating to your data privacy or information security; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, references to “Jack in the Box,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products, or information provided or made available under this or prior agreements between us relating to or arising from any aspect of your use or access of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Jack in the Box are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Jack in the Box for any reason.
(b)
Written Notice of Dispute.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Jack in the Box should be addressed to: General Counsel – Arbitration Demand, Jack in the Box, 9357 Spectrum Center Blvd., San Diego, CA 92123 (“Notice Address”) and must be signed by you personally. Notice to you from Jack in the Box may be to you directly, or if you are represented, to your legal counsel. The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Jack in the Box and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Jack in the Box may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
(c)
Filing Fees.
After Jack in the Box receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. The filing fee currently is $225 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The AAA Rules may change from time to time, and you should review them periodically.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement’s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. However, if putative class or representative claims are initially brought by either party in a court of law, and a motion to compel arbitration is brought by any party, then the court shall decide whether this Agreement permits class or representative proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt, the court and arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including with regard to the class and representative waiver provision. In any arbitration, the arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit manifest errors of law or legal reasoning, and any award rendered by the arbitrator that employs a manifest error of law or legal reasoning may be vacated or corrected by a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.
Unless Jack in the Box and you agree otherwise, any arbitration will be governed by the substantive laws of your state, and hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing or registered address subject to certain exceptions herein. Case management and other hearings shall be heard via telephone unless otherwise agreed to. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Jack in the Box will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Jack in the Box for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Jack in the Box or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Jack in the Box are entitled. In arbitration, and to the extent otherwise permitted by law, the parties may exchange “offers of compromise” or stipulate to judgments or awards in the same way the parties could in court, including for example, under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 for arbitrations taking place in California. Such offers of compromise shall have the same force and effect as they would in a court proceeding. The arbitration proceedings shall otherwise remain confidential, except for purposes of seeking court intervention (if necessary).
(d)
Discovery.
Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
(e)
No Class Action Matters.
YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Further, unless both you and Jack in the Box agree otherwise, the arbitrator or arbitration administrator may not consolidate or aggregate more than one person’s claims (except as set forth in subparagraph (f) below), and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of subparagraph (e) enforced. Any claims or causes of action seeking relief not subject to individual arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of individual arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing in subparagraph (e) or (f) below shall prevent you or Jack in the Box from participating in a class wide settlement of claims.
(f)
Mass Arbitration.
YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX AGREE THAT ADMINISTRATION OF ANY MASS, COLLECTIVE, OR BATCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS SUBPARAGRAPH (F).
For the purposes of this Agreement, “Mass Arbitration” means 25 or more arbitration demands that: (i) are filed within 180 days of each other, (ii) allege similar or identical claims or causes of action, and (iii) either (a) the parties to those arbitration demands seek to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate together, or (b) are filed by the same counsel or in coordination with each other.
In the event that Mass Arbitration is attempted or sought involving 250 arbitration demands or less, you and Jack in the Box agree the arbitration provider shall: (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no less than 25 arbitration demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. In the event that Mass Arbitration is attempted or sought involving over 250 arbitration demands, you and Jack in the Box agree that the arbitration provider shall: (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no less than 250 arbitration demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. All Mass Arbitration shall be subject to all other substantive and procedural terms contained within this Agreement.
You and Jack in the Box agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the aforementioned protocol for Mass Arbitration with regard to resolution, fees, and administration. To the extent a dispute arises regarding the administration of a Mass Arbitration, including, but not limited to, whether any conditions precedent have been satisfied or the advancement of fees, you and Jack in the Box agree to the appointment of a Process Arbitrator pursuant to the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules of the AAA.
If any part of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion shall be stricken, and the remainder of this subparagraph (f) and this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.
If the arbitration provider is unwilling or unable to follow the procedures set forth in this subparagraph (f) with regard to Mass Arbitration, the parties may attempt to retain a different, mutually agreeable and widely-recognized arbitration organization that will agree to follow the procedures set forth in this this subparagraph (f). In the event that the parties are unable to retain or agree to such an alternative arbitration provider, the alternative dispute resolution provisions set forth in these Terms shall not apply to those demands within the Mass Arbitration.
If this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this Agreement shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of the Agreement enforced.
(g)
Agreement Modifications.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Jack in the Box makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) after your enrollment in a service or program or your use of the Services, you may reject any such change and require Jack in the Box to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time of your enrollment or purchase if a dispute between us arises, by providing Notice to Jack in the Box at the Notice Address in subparagraph (b) above within 30 days of such change.
MISCELLANEOUS
Governing Law.
You and Jack in the Box agree that your access to the Services and these Terms will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of California, United States of America, Planet Earth, notwithstanding any principles of conflict of law, except for the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver provision above. Any dispute that is not subject to the Arbitration Agreement or cannot be heard in a small claims court shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in San Diego County, California.
Availability of the Services.
The Services are available in select regions of the United States. There may be some products and services, which are part of the Services, that may not be available at all Jack in the Box locations. In addition, some of the promotional items, premiums, and prices may only be available for a specified time in certain areas. We will not be liable if, for any reason, all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period.
Severability and No Waiver.
No waiver by Jack in the Box of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition, and any failure by Jack in the Box to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, or removed from the Terms, and except as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver Section, all other parts of these Terms are still valid and enforceable. The parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of these Terms with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the fullest extent possible, the economic, business, and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.
Modification.
Jack in the Box may revise these Terms from time to time. If we revise these Terms, those changes will appear on this page and the “last updated” line will be updated. Modifications take effect as soon as they are posted to the Services, delivered to you, or reasonably made available to you in writing by Jack in the Box, via e-mail, text messaging, or otherwise. However, no unilateral amendment will retroactively modify the parties’ agreed-to Arbitration Agreement of these Terms for then-pending disputes, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. In all other respects, any modification or update to the Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by subparagraph (g) of the Arbitration Agreement above. Your continued use of the Services after any change in these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such change.
Term and Termination.
Jack in the Box can decide to suspend, restrict, limit, or terminate your access to its Services with or without a warning at any time for any reason in Jack in the Box’s sole discretion. Jack in the Box also reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders placed on our Services in our sole discretion. YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY MODIFICATION, SUSPENSION, OR DISCONTINUANCE OF ANY FEATURE OR COMPONENT OF THE SERVICES. Jack in the Box can also assign its rights under the Terms to any other party at any time without notice to you.
Entire Agreement.
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Jack in the Box pertaining to the subject matter hereof. They supersede all other agreements, communications, or representations, oral or written, between us, past or present.

(collectively, “CCPA”) and “Shine the Light” laws provide you with additional rights regarding your personal information. This section on Additional Information for California Residents supplements this privacy policy and applies solely to eligible residents of the State of California as of January 1, 2023.
Your Rights
Under the CCPA, California consumers have the following rights, which can be exercised directly or in certain cases, through an authorized agent. In particular, subject to certain exceptions, you have the following rights under the CCPA:
Right to Know/Access
: You have the right to know about and access personal information collected, disclosed, shared, or sold about you. Specifically, you have the right to request information about the categories of personal information we have collected about you, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the categories of third parties with whom we disclose, sell, or share such information. You also have the right to request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
Right to Opt Out of Sales/Sharing
: You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information to third parties.
Right to Delete
: You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information we have collected from you.

Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information

Right to Non-Discrimination
: You have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.
Only you, or an agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request to access, delete, or correct your personal information. For any requests made by an authorized agent, we will require written authorization from you in order to process.
We must verify your identity prior to processing a request to access, delete, or correct your personal information. To do so, we will ask that you confirm two or three points of information that we have in our records, such as an email address or phone number. Once your identity has been verified, the request will proceed. Jack in the Box will store personal information collected for the purpose of verifying your request for as long as permissible under applicable law.
If you, or your authorized agent, would like to exercise one or more of the above rights, please submit a request using our Jack in the Box
Privacy Portal
or contact us at 1-800-378-5225.
Collection and Disclosure of Personal Information
We describe the personal information we have collected from consumers in the preceding twelve (12) months and the sources from which we have collected such personal information in the
Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It
section above.
We describe the business and commercial purposes for which we collect personal information in the
How We Use Your Information
section above, and we describe the third parties with which we disclose personal information in the
Disclosure of Your Information
section.
Sale or Share of Personal Information
Within the last twelve (12) months, we have disclosed certain categories of information to third parties who provide services to us in connection with our marketing efforts. Some of these third parties may retain rights to use this data for their own purposes. While this may not be deemed a sale of personal information in the traditional sense, this disclosure of information with these third-party providers may be deemed a “sale” of personal information under CCPA. They may also be deemed as a “share” of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes under the CCPA. This includes data relating to internet or other similar network activity, commercial information, geolocation data, identifiers, and information under the California Customer Records statute, such as email address, mobile phone number, whether you use our mobile application or your zip code, purchase and transactional history (including dates and items purchase), and whether you have registered an account with us. This information may be provided to companies which help us target advertisements and in our other digital marketing efforts.
To opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, please submit a request using our Jack in the Box
Privacy Portal
or contact us at 1-800-378-5225.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell or share personal information of California minors under the age of 16.
Sensitive Personal Information
We have collected the following categories of sensitive personal information (as defined in the CCPA) in the past twelve (12) months: your precise geolocation. For further details on how we obtain this information, please review the
Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It
section above.
We collect, use, and disclose this sensitive personal information as necessary to provide the Services, as reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests such Services, and for other permissible business purposes under the CCPA.
We do not “sell” or “share” your sensitive personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA.
Retention of Personal Information
We retain each category of personal information, including sensitive personal information, for the length of time that is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to prevent fraud, and to enforce our agreements. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the nature of the use of our Services, your general relationship with us, the impact on our ability to provide you Services if we delete your personal information, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations, and our use of your personal information for aggregated market research.
Notice of Financial Incentive
We provide financial incentives to consumers who allow us to collect and retain personal information (e.g., name, phone number, and email address) and/or commercial information (e.g., purchase history). These incentives may result in differences in our prices or services offered to consumers and may include payments to consumers (e.g., free food) and/or a lower price for goods and services (e.g., discounts and other promotions).
The financial incentives we may provide include:
The Jack Pack loyalty program, whereby consumers can earn rewards credits based upon their purchases;
Discounts or free products for frequent visitors; and
Periodic promotional discounts and other offers.
The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms and/or in the details of the incentive offer.
Please note that participating in any financial incentive program is entirely optional and participants may withdraw from the program at any time. To opt-out of the program and forgo any ongoing incentives, please follow the instructions in the program’s terms and conditions or contact us using the contact information below.
Each financial incentive or price or service difference related to the collection and use of personal information is based upon our reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business, which takes into consideration the value of the offer itself and the anticipated revenue generation that may be realized by rewarding brand loyalty and repeat purchases. We calculate the value of the offer and financial incentive by using the expense related to the offer.

ABOUT THE JACK PACK®
The Jack Pack® is a loyalty program that lets us reward and thank our most loyal customers. Participants in the Jack Pack® are able to earn and accumulate points for every order placed through the Mobile App or through the Website. Participants can also earn points for purchases made at a store by scanning a bar code on the receipt within 72 hours of purchase. For example, if a purchase was made on a Monday at 12:45 p.m., the receipt must be scanned by Thursday at 12:44 p.m. or else the points will expire.
Points can be redeemed for discounts on future orders made via the Mobile App or Website while signed into your Jack Pack® account. For additional information regarding the Jack Pack®, please visit our
FAQ
.
ELIGIBILITY, ENROLLMENT, AND UNENROLLMENT
The Jack Pack® is intended for personal use only, and any commercial use is strictly prohibited. The Jack Pack® is not intended to be used by, or targeted to, anyone under the age of 16 years old. If you are at least 16 years old but not yet 18 years old (or the legal age of majority if different in your jurisdiction), then you must review these Terms of Use with your parent or guardian, and they must understand and agree to these Terms of Use in order for you to participate in the Jack Pack®.
No purchase is necessary to enroll or participate in the Jack Pack®. There are two ways to join, either by signing up online via the Website or by downloading the Mobile App from the
App Store
or
Google Play
. Once downloaded, follow the prompts to create an account and accept these Terms of Use. Mobile App users that created an account prior to the introduction of the Jack Pack Program® are not automatically enrolled. These existing Mobile App users can enroll by signing up online via the Website or by following the prompts to enroll in the Jack Pack® from within the Mobile App. Your account is personal to you and may not be sold, transferred, or assigned to, or shared with family, friends, or others. You may have only one Jack Pack® account.
EARNING AND REDEEMING POINTS
Jack Pack® participants can earn points by making qualified purchases using the Mobile App or Website, or by scanning an order receipt via the Mobile App within 72 hours of purchase for in-person orders made at the store. Participants earn one (1) point for each one dollar ($1.00) spent on food and beverage purchases. Purchases are rounded down or rounded up to the nearest one-dollar ($1) increment. For example, a purchase of $4.01 to $4.49 would earn 4 points, while a purchase of $4.50 to $4.99 would earn 5 points. Points are earned based on the actual purchase price of qualifying menu items after the application of any coupons or other discounts. Points are not earned for tips, delivery charges, taxes, or any additional fees. Points are not transferable.
We reserve the right to exclude any menu items from the program in our sole discretion.
Jack Pack® participants begin to accumulate points only once they’ve joined the Jack Pack®. No points will be awarded for any purchases made at a store or via the Mobile App or the Website prior to joining the Jack Pack® Program. Additional opportunities to earn points may be offered in the future at our discretion.
Jack Pack® participants can use points to redeem rewards on future purchases using the Mobile App or the Website while signed into their Jack Pack® account. Rewards are accepted by participating Jack in the Box® restaurants. A reward may not be redeemed on its own and requires one additional food or drink item in the same order. Only one reward may be applied per transaction, and rewards are not valid with any other offer or deals.
POINT BALANCE AND EXPIRATION
We reserve the right to determine and modify the amount of points in any participant’s account based on our internal records. All points earned as a result of your participation in the Jack Pack® will expire if a participant’s account is inactive at any time for a period of three hundred and sixty-five (365) consecutive days. No cash or credit shall be given for any expired or unused points. Points that accrue in a participant’s account are not transferable, including via sale, barter, assignment, bequest, inheritance, divorce, property settlement, or other domestic court action, and are subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
PROMOTIONAL ONLY
The points awarded in connection with the Jack Pack® are purely promotional and do not have any cash value. Moreover, these points do not constitute the property of any participant, and cannot be redeemed for cash or gift cards.

ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CALLING JACK IN THE BOX’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT 1-800-378-5225. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT JACK IN THE BOX’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE YOUR CONCERNS, WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. JACK IN THE BOX WILL PAY ALL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATOR EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS OR BROUGHT IN BAD FAITH. HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.
(a)
Arbitration Agreement.
Jack in the Box and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between us arising out of or relating to this Arbitration Agreement (“Agreement”) and use of or participation in the Jack Pack®, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, any dispute you or we may have relating to copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property shall not be governed by this agreement to arbitrate. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that any claims you or we may have relating to intellectual property rights against the other, including seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Agreement otherwise includes, but is not limited to: claims based in contract, tort, warranty, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; claims relating to our websites; claims arising out of or relating to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; claims relating to your data privacy or information security; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, references to “Jack in the Box,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products, or information provided or made available under this or prior agreements between us relating to or arising from any aspect of your use of or access to the Jack Pack®. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Jack in the Box are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Jack in the Box for any reason.
(b)
Notice of Dispute.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Jack in the Box should be addressed to: General Counsel – Arbitration Demand, Jack in the Box, 9357 Spectrum Center Blvd., San Diego, CA 92123 (“Notice Address”) and must be signed by you personally. Notice to you from Jack in the Box may be sent to you directly, or if you are represented, to your legal counsel. The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Jack in the Box and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Jack in the Box may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
(c)
Filing Fees.
After Jack in the Box receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. The filing fee currently is $225 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The AAA Rules may change from time to time, and you should review them periodically.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement’s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. However, if putative class or representative claims are initially brought by either party in a court of law, and a motion to compel arbitration is brought by any party, then the court shall decide whether this Agreement permits class or representative proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt, the court and arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including with regard to the class and representative waiver provision. In any arbitration, the arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit manifest errors of law or legal reasoning, and any award rendered by the arbitrator that employs a manifest error of law or legal reasoning may be vacated or corrected by a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.
Unless Jack in the Box and you agree otherwise, any arbitration will be governed by the substantive laws of your state, and hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing or registered address subject to certain exceptions herein. Case management and other hearings shall be heard via telephone unless otherwise agreed to. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Jack in the Box will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Jack in the Box for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Jack in the Box or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Jack in the Box are entitled. In arbitration, and to the extent otherwise permitted by law, the parties may exchange “offers of compromise” or stipulate to judgments or awards in the same way the parties could in court, including for example, under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 for arbitrations taking place in California. Such offers of compromise shall have the same force and effect as they would in a court proceeding. The arbitration proceedings shall otherwise remain confidential, except for purposes of seeking court intervention (if necessary).
(d)
Discovery.
Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
(e)
No Class Action Matters.
YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Further, unless both you and Jack in the Box agree otherwise, the arbitrator or arbitration administrator may not consolidate or aggregate more than one person’s claims (except as set forth in subparagraph (f) below), and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of subparagraph (e) enforced. Any claims or causes of action seeking relief not subject to individual arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of individual arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing in subparagraph (e) or (f) below shall prevent you or Jack in the Box from participating in a class wide settlement of claims.
(f)
Mass Arbitration.
YOU AND JACK IN THE BOX AGREE THAT ADMINISTRATION OF ANY MASS, COLLECTIVE, OR BATCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS SUBPARAGRAPH (F).
For the purposes of this Agreement, “Mass Arbitration” means 25 or more arbitration demands that: (i) are filed within 180 days of each other, (ii) allege similar or identical claims or causes of action, and (iii) either (a) the parties to those arbitration demands seek to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate together, or (b) are filed by the same counsel or in coordination with each other.
In the event that Mass Arbitration is attempted or sought involving 250 arbitration demands or less, you and Jack in the Box agree the arbitration provider shall: (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no less than 25 arbitration demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. In the event that Mass Arbitration is attempted or sought involving over 250 arbitration demands, you and Jack in the Box agree that the arbitration provider shall: (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no less than 250 arbitration demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. All Mass Arbitration shall be subject to all other substantive and procedural terms contained within this Agreement.
You and Jack in the Box agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the aforementioned protocol for Mass Arbitration with regard to resolution, fees, and administration. To the extent a dispute arises regarding the administration of a Mass Arbitration, including, but not limited to, whether any conditions precedent have been satisfied or the advancement of fees, you and Jack in the Box agree to the appointment of a Process Arbitrator pursuant to the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules of the AAA.
If any part of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion shall be stricken, and the remainder of this subparagraph (f) and this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.
If the arbitration provider is unwilling or unable to follow the procedures set forth in this subparagraph (f) with regard to Mass Arbitration, the parties may attempt to retain a different, mutually agreeable and widely-recognized arbitration organization that will agree to follow the procedures set forth in this this subparagraph (f). In the event that the parties are unable to retain or agree to such an alternative arbitration provider, the alternative dispute resolution provisions set forth in these Terms shall not apply to those demands within the Mass Arbitration.
If this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this Agreement shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of the Agreement enforced.
(g)
Agreement Modifications.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Jack in the Box makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) after your enrollment in the Jack Pack® Program, you may reject any such change and require Jack in the Box to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time of your enrollment if a dispute between us arises, by providing Notice to Jack in the Box at the Notice Address in subparagraph (b) above within thirty (30) days of such change.
GOVERNING LAW
Any dispute arising from these Jack Pack® Terms of Use or your access to and/or participation in the Jack Pack® Program shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to any conflict of law rules or principles, except for the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver provision above. Any dispute that is not subject to the Arbitration Agreement or cannot be heard in a small claims court shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in San Diego County, California.
SEVERABILITY AND NO WAIVER
No waiver by Jack in the Box of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition, and any failure by Jack in the Box to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any portion of these Jack Pack® Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, or removed from the Terms, and except as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver Section, all other parts of these Terms are still valid and enforceable. The parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of these Terms with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the fullest extent possible, the economic, business, and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.
