Our Global Operations and Data Transfers
To support our global operations:
We store the information described in the “
What Information Do We Collect
” section in servers located in the EEA.
Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, located outside the EU, EEA, and Switzerland (see
here
for further information), are given limited remote access to your Personal Data. See the “
How and Why We Share Your Information
” section above for more information.
We share your Personal Data with service providers, merchandise partners, and other parties described in the “
How and Why We Share Your Information
” section above, which can be located outside the EU, EEA, and Switzerland. Our service providers are based in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North and South America.
When we transfer your information outside of the EU, EEA, and Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:
Adequacy decisions.
These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 of the GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) which recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We can transfer your information detailed under the “
What Information Do We Collect
” section, as described in the “
How and Why We Share Your Information
” section, to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed
here
; or
Standard contractual clauses.
The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These contractual clauses (and their approved equivalent for Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information detailed under the “
What Information Do We Collect
” section, as described in the “
How and Why We Share Your Information
” section, to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without adequacy decisions.
In certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable law to transfer information to a third country.

Adequacy decisions

Children
The Service is not intended for use by anyone who is under the age of 18 or a minor (as defined by applicable law). If you are a parent or guardian of a child about whom you believe we have collected personal information, please contact us directly or through our
online reporting form
. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the Service from a child or without the knowledge of a child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will comply with applicable legal requirements to delete the information.
Data Security and Retention
The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We use technical and organisational measures to help protect your Personal Data from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We also follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) in handling your credit card information. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies.
We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to provide the Service, to comply with legal obligations, or to protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. When we no longer require the Personal Data we have collected about you for those purposes, we delete it, or anonymise it.
The length of time we will retain your Personal Data is generally determined by how long we require it to provide you with the Service and customer support.
For example:
As described above in the “
How and Why We Process Your Information and Our Legal Bases for Processing
” section:
We require certain of your Account and Profile information to create and manage your Temu account. We need to keep this information for the lifetime of your account in order to maintain your account.
We retain your account preferences, including your communication preferences, which you are free to amend at any time, for the lifetime of your account.
We retain your report relating to products (including complaint records and supporting documentation) for 18 months after the complaint in question has been resolved.
If we decide to terminate the provision of the Service to you, we retain your appeal records and supporting documentation for no longer than one year after the appeal has been resolved.
We retain any communication you have had with our customer support team for the lifetime of your account.
In certain circumstances, we need to retain your Personal Data for longer periods in order to comply with legal obligations, as described further above in the “
How and Why We Process Your Information and Our Legal Bases for Processing
” section above. This will, in certain circumstances, involve the retention of certain of your Personal Data after your account has been deleted.
We retain your Personal Data to:
respond to a lawful request or legal process. For example, to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities we may need to preserve certain of your Personal Data after your account has been deleted.
address requests and complaints. For example, if there is an ongoing dispute in relation to your account, we will retain certain of your Personal Data where it is required to address the dispute or complaint.
investigate issues relating to the security and safety of our services and to protect our rights, property and customers. For example, we may retain certain of your Personal Data where it is necessary to investigate, actual or potential misuse of the Service.

web form

Our Global Operations and Data Transfers
To support our global operations:
We store the information described in the “
What Information Do We Collect
” section in servers located in the EEA.
Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, located outside the EU, EEA, and Switzerland (see
here
for further information), are given limited remote access to your Personal Data. See the “
How and Why We Share Your Information
” section above for more information.
We share your Personal Data with service providers, merchandise partners, and other parties described in the “
How and Why We Share Your Information
” section above, which can be located outside the EU, EEA, and Switzerland. Our service providers are based in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North and South America.
When we transfer your information outside of the EU, EEA, and Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:
Adequacy decisions.
These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 of the GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) which recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We can transfer your information detailed under the “
What Information Do We Collect
” section, as described in the “
How and Why We Share Your Information
” section, to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed
here
; or
Standard contractual clauses.
The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These contractual clauses (and their approved equivalent for Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information detailed under the “
What Information Do We Collect
” section, as described in the “
How and Why We Share Your Information
” section, to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without adequacy decisions.
In certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable law to transfer information to a third country.

Adequacy decisions
(or equivalent links under applicable laws) or
Standard contractual clauses
(or equivalent links under applicable laws).
Children
The Service is not intended for use by anyone who is under the age of 18 or a minor (as defined by applicable law). If you are a parent or guardian of a child about whom you believe we have collected personal information, please contact us directly or through our
online reporting form
. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the Service from a child or without the knowledge of a child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will comply with applicable legal requirements to delete the information.
Data Security and Retention
The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We use technical and organisational measures to help protect your Personal Data from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We also follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) in handling your credit card information. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies.
We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to provide the Service, to comply with legal obligations, or to protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. When we no longer require the Personal Data we have collected about you for those purposes, we delete it, or anonymise it.
The length of time we will retain your Personal Data is generally determined by how long we require it to provide you with the Service and customer support.
For example:
As described above in the “
How and Why We Process Your Information and Our Legal Bases for Processing
” section:
We require certain of your Account and Profile information to create and manage your Temu account. We need to keep this information for the lifetime of your account in order to maintain your account.
We retain your account preferences, including your communication preferences, which you are free to amend at any time, for the lifetime of your account.
We retain your report relating to products (including complaint records and supporting documentation) for 18 months after the complaint in question has been resolved.
If we decide to terminate the provision of the Service to you, we retain your appeal records and supporting documentation for no longer than one year after the appeal has been resolved.
We retain any communication you have had with our customer support team for the lifetime of your account.
In certain circumstances, we need to retain your Personal Data for longer periods in order to comply with legal obligations, as described further above in the “
How and Why We Process Your Information and Our Legal Bases for Processing
” section above. This will, in certain circumstances, involve the retention of certain of your Personal Data after your account has been deleted.
We retain your Personal Data to:
respond to a lawful request or legal process. For example, to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities we may need to preserve certain of your Personal Data after your account has been deleted.
address requests and complaints. For example, if there is an ongoing dispute in relation to your account, we will retain certain of your Personal Data where it is required to address the dispute or complaint.
investigate issues relating to the security and safety of our services and to protect our rights, property and customers. For example, we may retain certain of your Personal Data where it is necessary to investigate, actual or potential misuse of the Service.
