How does it work ?
SyncMyDroid copies the files you selected to your computer periodically or when you request it in the app.
If you modify a file on your Android device, it will be updated on your computer too.
If you delete a file from your Android device, its copy remains on your computer (unless you delete the copy too).
If you modify the copied file on your computer, SyncMyDroid will keep your modifications and create a backup copy of the original file next to the modified one.
