THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We encrypt personal data appropriately and use proper technical and organisational measures across the business.
All of the personal data we hold is hosted on Heroku’s cloud platform and AWS directly, which provides us with a wide range of resilience, scaling and security features. Heroku’s cloud platform is hosted on the Amazon Web Services’ platform. Heroku is accredited under ISO 27001, SOC 1 and SOC 2/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402, FISMA Moderate, and Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX).
All third-party interactions with the Cleo service are made through a secure socket layer (SSL), the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.
We have written contracts with each of those third-party processors which contain safeguards for your information.
‍
YOUR RIGHTS
You have the right to:
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (of our own or of a third-party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us on the details above. We aim to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
‍
YOUR RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT WITH THE ICO
If you feel that we have not handled information relating to you properly, or if you have contacted us about how we use that information and are unhappy with our response, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.

THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We encrypt personal data appropriately and use proper technical and organisational measures across the business.
All of the personal data we hold is hosted on Heroku’s cloud platform and AWS directly, which provides us with a wide range of resilience, scaling and security features. Heroku’s cloud platform is hosted on the Amazon Web Services’ platform. Heroku is accredited under ISO 27001, SOC 1 and SOC 2/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402, FISMA Moderate, and Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX).
All third-party interactions with the Cleo service are made through a secure socket layer (SSL), the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.
We have written contracts with each of those third-party processors which contain safeguards for your information.
‍
YOUR RIGHTS
You have the right to:
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (of our own or of a third-party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us on the details above. We aim to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

YOUR RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT WITH THE ICO
If you feel that we have not handled information relating to you properly, or if you have contacted us about how we use that information and are unhappy with our response, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.

Data protection declaration according to Art. 13 and 21 GDPR
For the BitLabs service of BitBurst GmbH
‍
1. General
The protection of your personal data is important to us, BitBurst GmbH, Lerchenweg 3, 40789 Monheim am Rhein, Germany. Therefore, we would like to offer you comprehensive transparency regarding the processing of your data in our services through this data protection declaration. Because only if the processing is comprehensible to you as a data subject are you sufficiently informed about the scope, purposes and benefits of the processing and we have complied with the requirements of the GDPR.
Responsible in terms of the basic data protection regulation (GDPR), the Federal Data Protection Act according to German law (BDSG) and other data protection regulations is
BitBurst GmbH
Lerchenweg 3,
40789 Monheim am Rhein, Germany
015256114159

Hereinafter referred to as “responsible party” or “we”.
‍
2. General information on data processing
a. Information about our authorizations
We process personal data within the legally permissible limits. This means that data processing operations are based on a legal basis. These are standardised in Art. 6 Para. 1 GDPR. Most data processing operations are based on a legitimate interest on our part (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR), on processing operations necessary for the performance of the contract (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) or on the basis of consent granted by you (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). In the latter case you will be informed separately (e.g. via a cookie banner) of the consent procedure.
Personal data will only be passed on in the cases described below.
We process personal data only for clear purposes (Art. 5 para. 1 lit. b GDPR). As soon as the purpose of the processing ceases to apply, your personal data will be deleted or protected by technical and organisational measures (e.g. by pseudonymisation).
The same applies to the expiry of a prescribed storage period, subject to the cases in which further storage is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract. In addition, a legal obligation may arise for longer storage or disclosure to third parties (in particular to law enforcement agencies). In other cases, the storage period and type of data collected and the type of data processing depends on which Bitlabs functions you use in each individual case. We would be pleased to provide you with information on this in individual cases, in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR.
b. Information on the technical process of our service
The technical backend of our service (“network”) is connected to various market research companies, marketplaces and enterprises (collectively “marketplaces”). These marketplaces regularly create surveys for their customers (companies). For these surveys, the marketplaces are looking for participants to participate in the surveys. To assist the Marketplaces in finding participants, we have built the Bitlabs service. We bring the marketplaces that are looking for participants together with the participants, that is, you. When you use the service, you as a user enter personal data in your user profile. This personal data is also called “qualifications” in our service. This is because we have to filter for each new survey for which participants are sought whether you are eligible for the survey. Either we can find this out on the basis of the qualifications you have already deposited or we will ask you again to complete some further qualifications which you can deposit in your user account. If you are eligible for a survey because the qualifications required by the marketplaces and the qualifications you have stored match, you have the opportunity to participate. If you decide to participate, we will pass on the matching qualifications to the marketplace. The survey itself will either take place in our service product itself or on the website of the marketplace or the website of the market research company or a company. A link from our service will connect you directly to the survey.
The data protection declarations of the marketplaces can be viewed under the following links. The marketplaces are listed here under the publication name within our service, but not with the full name or company name.

The purely informational calling of Bitlabs requires the processing of the following personal data and information: Address of the terminal device with which you access Bitlabs (IP address) and the time of the call to Bitlbas. All this information is transmitted automatically unless you have configured it to suppress transmission of the information.
This personal data is processed for the purpose of making the Bitlabs service functional and optimizing it, as well as to ensure the security of our information technology systems. These purposes are at the same time legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR.
The storage period of your personal data is a maximum of 14 days. This personal data is not merged with other data sources. Data will only be passed on to third parties in necessary cases. Subject to further provisions of this privacy policy, data will not be transferred to third countries or international organisations.
‍
3.2 Use at Bitlabs
Beyond the purely informational use of Bitlabs, you have the opportunity to use our services and our entire range of products.
This use of our services requires the processing of personal data and information in the manner described in this Section 3.
Some processing steps may also be carried out by third parties. The data processing of the third party providers is carried out in accordance with the terms of the relevant data protection declarations. In the case of data processing with third party providers, this may constitute commissioned processing within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. This is subject to strict legal requirements, which we comply with in the course of our contractual agreements with our contract processors.
The collection of this data, which is related to your profile, is carried out for the purpose of optimising our services, for the purpose of guaranteeing the functionality of our offer (legitimate purposes according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) as well as for the fulfilment of our service obligations towards you (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR). Should your consent be necessary for the processing procedure, we will obtain it at the appropriate point (e.g. via the opt-in possibility within the framework of a cookie banner when using our service for the first time). If you have any further questions, we will be happy to assist you within the scope of your right to information according to Art. 15 para. 1 GDPR.
‍
3.3 Contact form / Contact by e-mail
We process the data you provide us with when contacting us for the purpose of answering your enquiry, your e-mail or your request for a callback. Processed data categories are master data, contact data, content data, possibly usage data, connection data and possibly contract data. In individual cases, we forward this data to companies affiliated with us, i.e. only within our company/group. The legal basis of the processing depends on the purpose:
– Basically, it is based on our legitimate interest and thus on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR;
– If the aim is to conclude a contract, the authorization is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
‍
3.4 Collection and use of data
When you use the Bitlabs service, personal data is processed which you can store yourself or which you are asked to provide as part of the qualification query for a new survey. This includes your age, location, gender, and any other personal characteristics (“qualifications”) required by survey partners to join a survey.
When you use our service, Bitlabs places cookies on your device to enable you to use Bitlabs’ features properly.
The purpose of the processing operations associated with creating and completing a profile is to enable us to assign future usage operations and to enable you to access the full range of Bitlabs services. Directly connected with this is, for example, checking whether you are suitable for surveys that we receive from the marketplaces. To participate in surveys, you must meet the criteria requested for the specific survey. We will check whether you meet the criteria either by asking you (if we have not yet asked you for the criteria of the survey) or automatically (if we have already asked you for the criteria of the survey) after receiving the survey by comparing the criteria with the information you have provided about yourself.
The processing of your data thus serves the execution of the contract, is thus earmarked and necessary in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
The storage of IP address and time of registration is necessary to ensure the security of our information technology systems. This is also in our legitimate interest, which is why the processing is also lawful in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
The personal data entered by you will be stored by Bitlabs until the time your profile is deleted, beyond that only as long as the processing is necessary for the fulfilment of any contract.
It is not intended to pass on your data to third parties. All checks on the requested criteria in a survey are carried out by us on our servers.
‍
3.5 Processing of the reward
Rewards are processed by the operator of the product from which you accessed the Bitlabs service. For successfully completed surveys, we only forward completion information and an identifier such as the ID of your survey start so that the operator itself can assign the reward to the user on its servers.
‍
3.6 Tools
IP stack
In order to locate your location, we collect your IP location by determining your IP address through the service of IP Stack. Processed data categories are therefore connection data. The recipient of the data is apilayer GmbH, Elisabethstrasse 15/5, 1010 Vienna, Austria. A transfer to a third country is not intended. We do not store any personal data on your terminal device and do not read out such data. Our legal basis for the use of IPStack results from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest).

4. order processing
In some cases we use external service providers, such as IPStack, to process your data. These service providers have been carefully selected and commissioned by us. They are bound by our instructions and are regularly checked. Our contract processing contracts comply with the strict requirements of Art. 28 GDPR and the specifications of the German data protection authorities.
