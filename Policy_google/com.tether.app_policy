‘Tether’-Privacy Policy
Effective Date:
September 10, 2024
At Tether ("we" or "Tether"), your privacy is paramount to us. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices for
      collecting, using, and sharing information on our website ("Site") and services ("Services"). By accessing or
      using the Site, you accept this Privacy Policy. We may update this policy from time to time, and any changes will
      become effective immediately upon posting. By continuing to use the Site, you agree to these changes. Please
      review this policy regularly.
Age Requirement
Tether is intended for users aged 18 years and older. Individuals under 18 are not permitted to use or access the
      Site or Services.
Information Collection
We collect two types of information:
Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
When creating a profile, we collect details like your username, email address, birthdate, gender, and any
            other information you choose to provide. Photos you upload might reveal your identity and can be viewed by
            authorized users.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII):
This includes data that does not identify you personally, such as device type, IP address, browser type,
            operating system, access times, pages viewed, and ads clicked. We may use cookies to enhance your
            experience, but you can disable cookies through your browser settings.
Collection from Third Parties
We may also obtain information from third-party sources, including linked accounts like Facebook, depending on
      your privacy settings on those platforms.
Usage and Sharing of Information
Non-Personally Identifiable Information:
Non-PII is used to personalize your experience, make your profile searchable, and deliver relevant
        advertisements. We may share Non-PII with third parties, such as advertisers and consultants, for research and
        service improvements.
Personally Identifiable Information:
Your credit card information is processed through third-party services (e.g., Apple iTunes or Google Play).
        Their privacy policies will govern the use of your PII. We do not share PII with advertisers, even if you
        interact with their ads on our Site.
Third-Party Advertisers and Social Websites:
Tether may display advertisements from third parties. Clicking these ads could redirect you to websites not
        under our privacy control. We may access certain information from social sites (like Facebook) based on your
        settings. We encourage you to review these settings and make adjustments as necessary.
Legal and Safety Obligations
We may disclose your PII if required by law, court order, or to protect the safety and property of our users or
      the public. This covers scenarios where false information is provided or impersonation occurs.
Business Transitions
In the event of a sale, merger, or other business transformation, PII may be transferred as part of the business
      assets.
Do Not Track Signals
Tether respects “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals. Adjust your browser settings to indicate that you do not wish
      certain information to be collected about you.
Data Retention
Your information is retained as long as your profile is active or hidden. If your account remains inactive for
      more than 24 months, your PII will be deleted unless needed for legal or backup purposes.
Unsolicited Communication
Tether does not send unsolicited emails. You can opt-out of emails at any time. Report any unsolicited emails that
      seem to come from us immediately.
Monitoring Activities
While private communications are generally not monitored, we reserve the right to do so if policy violations are
      suspected. Publicly submitted content is subject to review and may be removed if deemed inappropriate.
Security Measures
We employ industry-standard practices to safeguard your PII, including encryption and firewalls. However, due to
      the inherent uncertainties of the internet, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
Accessing Your Information
You control your PII and can request access, correction, or deletion by editing your profile or contacting us at
