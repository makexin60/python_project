14. Cookies
Amplitude uses cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. Below we describe what cookies and web beacons are, why we use cookies and web beacons, the types of cookies and web beacons that we use, as well as what you can do in order to manage and delete cookies and web beacons.
What are cookies and web beacons?
Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors to their websites. A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to our Website. Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. The cookies can be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies are stored by a web browser and remain valid until a set expiration date. Session cookies only exist while your internet browser is open and are automatically deleted once you close your browser.
Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic files contained on pages of websites that permit companies to count users who have visited certain webpages on a website and are used for other related website statistics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

Functionality cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies allow us to remember how you are logged into our Website, when you logged in or out and the actions you have taken while you have been logged into the Website.
Advertising cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies are used by our third-party service providers to deliver advertising to you on other third-party websites as well as help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. We also use these types of cookies to analyze Website visits and ad conversions from third-party websites.

http://www.allaboutdnt.com
.

The site may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and avoid posting any personal information.

Information which you supply is not within our control and is subject to the operator’s own privacy policy and terms and conditions.
How we protect your information
Security is one of our biggest priorities at RevenueCat. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.

RevenueCat monitors application servers, infrastructure, and the RevenueCat network environment to detect potential abuse.
RevenueCat uses Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) to persistently store Customer data and does not host Customer data on its premises. AWS is a leading cloud provider, and holds industry best security certifications, such as SOC2 and ISO 27001. Customer data sent to RevenueCat from around the world is sent to AWS data centers located in the United States.
How long we keep your information
We retain personal data during any period in which you have expressed an interest in our products and services, for as long as you have an account with us in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for six years after that to identify any issues and resolve any legal proceedings. We may also retain aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services. You cannot be identified from aggregate information retained or used for these purposes.

Data processed on behalf of our Customers
RevenueCat may process End User Information on behalf of its customers. We are not the controllers of this data and act as data processors, and have no direct relationship with the individuals or end users whose personal information it processes. The processing of personal data sent from our Customers is governed by our
Terms of Use
,
Data Processing Addendum
or any other agreement agreed to and signed by us with our Customers.

We will process such data on behalf of the customer as prescribed in the respective agreements between RevenueCat and the customer. The customer’s privacy policy or other agreement between the customer and you (or your organization) will apply to such processing, and not this policy.
If your personal data is processed by RevenueCat on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to discontinue such processing, or if you seek to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, please contact the RevenueCat customer (the data controller) directly. The RevenueCat customer should then provide instructions to us, if necessary. If requested to remove data by the data controller we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal data.

What Does This Privacy Notice Apply To?
#
This Privacy Notice explains how we use your personal information when you use the Service, either as an individual customer or when you access the Service through one of our enterprise customers' accounts. We are the data controller of your personal information when we use it as described in this Privacy Notice, meaning that we determine and are responsible for how your personal information is processed.
Our Service allows customers to submit, manage or otherwise use content relating to others, such as end users of applications built and managed through the Service or their employees and contractors (“
Customer Data
”). We use such Customer Data primarily as a processor, meaning we process such Customer Data on behalf of and under the instructions of the relevant customer, in accordance with our
data processing addendum
. This Privacy Notice does not apply to such processing; if you believe your personal information has been included in any Customer Data, we recommend you read the Privacy Notice of the respective customer.
This Privacy Notice sets out how we use personal information. It does not cover our use of information that is not "personal information", "personal information" or similar terms under applicable law. This means that it does not cover our use of aggregated or anonymized information.
Where applicable law permits, it also does not cover deidentified information, meaning information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual (please note that this would not apply to personal information collected from you if you are in the UK, EEA or Switzerland).
We may also provide you with additional privacy notices or disclosures where the scope of the inquiry, request, or personal information we require falls outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional Privacy Notice or disclosures will set out how we may process the information you provide at that time. Please note that this Privacy Notice does not cover or apply to our processing of information about our employees or contractors or applicants for positions at Supabase.

Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.  We and our vendors may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Services.  These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Services to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services.  We and our vendors also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Services, because the Services may not function properly.  As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.
We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track (DNT) signals.  Please note that DNT is different from the Global Privacy Control referenced in Section 11 below.
Location Information.  When you use the Services, we may collect general location information (such as general location inferred from an IP address).
2. How We Use the Data We Collect
We use your information for business and commercial purposes, such as:
To provide you with the Services;
To respond to your questions and inquiries, including to provide customer support and technical assistance;
To communicate with you, including to send you emails about our products and services;
To send service notices;
To process transactions with you;
To analyze and improve the Services or any other products and services we provide;
To verify your identity;
To comply with our legal obligations or as permitted by law;
To protect the safety and/or integrity of our users, employees, other parties, members of the public, and/or our Services;
To conduct analysis and develop insights that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions and report on our business;
To prevent fraud and enforce our legal terms; and
To administer and troubleshoot the Services.
We may also use or disclose aggregated and/or de-identified information collected through the Services.  We will not attempt to re-identify such information, except as permitted by law.
3. When We Disclose Data We Collect
We may disclose the information we collect in the following circumstances:
Affiliates and Subsidiaries.
We may disclose information to our affiliates and subsidiaries.
Vendors.
We disclose your information to select vendors who perform services on our behalf.  They provide a variety of services to us, including data storage, analytics, billing, marketing, product content and features, customer service, data storage, security, fraud prevention, and legal services.
Safety and Protection of LaunchDarkly and Others.
We may disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to (i) protect or defend the rights, safety, or property of LaunchDarkly or other parties, including to defend or enforce our Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, or any other contractual arrangement; (ii) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (iii) protect the rights, property or personal safety of LaunchDarkly, its agents and affiliates, its employees, users and/or the public.
Legal Requirements.
We may disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to comply with any law enforcement, legal, or regulatory process, such as to respond to a warrant, subpoena, court order, or other applicable laws and regulations.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose certain information, in connection with or during negotiations or closing of any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
Consent/At Your Direction.
We may disclose your information to third parties based on your consent to do so.  For example, you may direct us to disclose information about you when you refer us or our Services to your colleagues or other acquaintances.
4. Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising
a. Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics.  These vendors use the sort of technology described in the “Information we collect automatically” section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive.  The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these vendors, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services.  We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section.  To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the
Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on
.
b. Tailored Advertising
We may also allow third-party advertising technologies to place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our websites and other third-party sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions and interactions with these marketing impressions are related to visits to our websites.  We also allow other unaffiliated parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.  Those parties may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below.  You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.  Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may disclose to a vendor in hashed, non-human-readable form.
You can also learn more about interest-based ads, or opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes by participating companies by visiting the
Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Link
, the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Consumer Opt-Out Link
, and/or the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
.  To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the
Google Ads Settings page
.  Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising.  In that case, the advertising content may not be tailored to your interests.  Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.  If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out pages, if you subsequently erase your cookies, or if you use a different computer or change web browsers, then your opt-out may no longer be effective.
5. Your Choices
a. Rights and choices
You have certain rights and choices with respect to your information such as:
Profile Information:  You can update certain of your profile information by accessing your account.
Marketing Communications:  You can unsubscribe from marketing emails by following the directions in those emails.  Please note that if you unsubscribe from marketing emails, we may still send you administrative emails regarding the Services, including, for example, notices of updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy.
Cookies & Analytics:  You can opt out of certain cookie-related and analytics processing by following the instructions in this Privacy Policy (see the “Tailored Advertising” subsection above).
Your local law may provide you certain rights with respect to your personal data.  Depending on your jurisdiction, you may request that we:
provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;
prevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling);
update information which is out of date or incorrect;
delete certain information that we are holding about you;
restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information;
transfer your information to a third-party provider of services; and
revoke your consent for the processing of your information.
Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include needing to continue processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.  We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.  To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.
b. Additional rights of residents of the European Economic Area and United Kingdom
LaunchDarkly is considered the “data controller” of the personal data we handle under this Privacy Policy.  In other words, LaunchDarkly is responsible for deciding how to collect, use and disclose this data, subject to applicable law.  The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using or disclosing of your information.  To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
Contractual Commitments:  We may use or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you.  For example, we will process your personal data to comply with our agreements with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.
With Your Consent:  Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use or disclose information on the basis of your consent.
Legitimate Interests:  In many cases, we use or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for the Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.
Legal Compliance:  We need to use and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
In addition to those rights described herein and in the “Rights and choices” subsection above, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.  However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.
c. Additional rights of residents of certain states
Please see Section 11 below for notices and additional information for residents of states that have consumer privacy laws, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia.
d. Additional rights of residents of Nevada
If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain personal data to unaffiliated parties.  We do not currently sell your personal data as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A.
6. Children’s Privacy
The Services are not designed for minors under 18.  Only persons 18 years of age or older may use the Services.  If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal data, we will close the account and delete the personal data to the extent required by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.  We may, where permitted by law, retain certain information internally for purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
7. Security
LaunchDarkly implements technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to help protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.  Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee the security of your personal data or communications.
If you have reason to believe that your data or someone else’s data is no longer secure, please contact
security@launchdarkly.com
.
8. Data Retention
We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.  The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it.  We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
9. Data Transfers
Our services are global and data may be transferred to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected, including to the United States and other countries, which may not have the equivalent data protection laws as those of your country.  Where required by law, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal data in accordance with applicable law, such as by obtaining your consent or participating in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as described below.
LaunchDarkly participates in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, “Data Privacy Framework” or “DPF”) issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission, UK Information Commissioner’s Office and the Swiss Data Federal Data Protection Commission.  LaunchDarkly commits to comply with the Data Privacy Framework Principles with respect to personal data the company receives from the EU, UK, and Switzerland in reliance on the DPF.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov.  To view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search.
If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any damages.  If you have a question or complaint related to our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, please contact us as described in Section 13 below.
For any complaints related to the DPF that cannot be resolved with us directly, you may refer the matter to JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Data Privacy Framework Program, which is described on the JAMS website at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework.  JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the JAMS rules.  Following the dispute resolution process, the mediator or the consumer may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has Data Privacy Framework investigatory and enforcement powers over LaunchDarkly.  Under limited circumstances, and after other available dispute resolution mechanisms have been exhausted, consumers may be able to invoke binding arbitration to address complaints about LaunchDarkly’s compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles.
10. Third-Party Links
The Services may contain links to third-party websites or services.  We are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services.  The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of those third-party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy.  We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third parties.
11. Supplementary Notice for Residents of Certain States
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia have enacted consumer privacy laws that grant their residents certain rights and require additional disclosures (“State Laws”). If you are a resident of one of these states, this Section 11 applies to you.  This Section 11 does not apply to personal data we collect from our employees and job applicants in their capacity as employees and job applicants, as such information practices are described in separate policies.
