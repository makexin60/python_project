You may avail some of our services without creating a Asha Live account, such as watching Asha Live broadcasts on our website.
If you choose to create a Asha Live account, Asha Live may ask for your name (you may use your real name if you are comfortable to do so, and you may also use an alias), birthday, gender, hometown, bio, education, career, profile image, email address and cell phone number, so that we could identify you and provide better Services to you. Some of the aforementioned information is not mandatory.
If you create a Asha Live account by connecting with a third-party service, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Instagram or VK, or if you connect a Asha Live account with a third-party account, we will use information from such third-party service, including your third-party service user name, gender, profile image and birthday.
Certain information will be displayed publicly on your profile page, such as your user name, your age and who you are following. Your recent videos will also be displayed publicly on your profile page.
