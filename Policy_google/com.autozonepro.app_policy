It describes our privacy practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you, your household, and the device you use when you interact with us (“Personal Information”), whether you are an existing, former, or potential customer. We typically collect your Personal Information when you:

Categories of Personal Information Recipients
We disclose your Personal Information with the following categories of recipients. They are granted access to your information only to perform the tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Service / Fulfillment Providers:
We employ third-party fulfillment, shipment, transportation, and/or delivery providers, companies, individuals, and agents under contract with AutoZone to facilitate and help us provide our Products and Services to you (“Service Providers”). These Service Providers perform tasks or functions on our behalf, provide fulfillment and other services, or assist us in analyzing how our Products and Services are used or delivered.

We pass on the payment card information that you provide to us either in Store or online to our payment card processors to fulfill your order.

Marketing Partners:

Often this information is masked in such a way that it does not directly identify you; however, we may share your Personal Information with such Marketing Partners on occasion.
Categories of Personal Information Disclosed for AutoZone Pro Business Purposes
AutoZone Pro is a business-to-business service for our commercial customers, not for individual customers. Therefore, the majority of information shared is your business information or device and Website interaction information as it relates to your role within your company. Frequently, business information identifies you as an individual as well, such as if your business is a proprietorship, or if you use your personal cell phone or email for business purposes. Sharing such business information becomes equivalent to sharing your Personal Information. Most importantly, we need to share your name, address, payment information, the items you have requested to purchase, and any other information related to your order with those fulfillment providers necessary to complete your order (such as our payment card processor, and our shipment, transportation, and/or delivery providers). We may at times need to share certain device and Website interaction information, such as your IP address and/or browser information, in relation to maintaining our Websites, providing you with ads or other marketing material, or providing other Services. This Business Information or device and Website interaction information may be used in a manner that may reasonably identify or be linked to you as an individual.
Categories of Personal Information Shared or Sold
AutoZone does not sell or share its customers' Personal Information or business information for monetary gain.
As described in the Cookies & Tracking Data section above, third-party cookies and other tracking technologies may be deployed on our Websites to collect device and Website interaction information. You may opt out of these third-party cookies and tracking technologies designed to deliver targeted advertising by using the methods provided in the Your Cookies and Tracking Data Choices section above.
AutoZone does not knowingly collect the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16.
Please note that a “sale” of Personal Information does not include instances when such information is part of a merger, acquisition, or other transaction involving all or part of our business. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or other business transaction, we may transfer your Personal Information to a third-party as part of that transaction. If such a transaction affects the manner in which your Personal Information is processed, we will notify you of such a change prior to its implementation.
DATA RETENTION
Your Personal Information will be retained in accordance with our Record Retention Policy. Generally, we will only keep your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Our Retention Policy for Personal Information is based on several factors including the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which your Personal Information is collected and processed, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
We also may retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief period, except in cases where they are used for Website safety and security, to improve Website functionality, or where we are legally obligated to retain them for longer periods. We may be required to keep your Personal Information longer due to legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may also retain your Personal Information longer if there is a complaint or if we can reasonably anticipate a legal dispute arising from our relationship with you. If a specific regulation applies to the retention of your Personal Information, that regulation takes precedence over our Retention Policy.
In some circumstances, we will anonymize or aggregate your Personal Information for research or statistical purposes. Once Personal Information is anonymized or aggregated, it can no longer be associated with an individual person. In that case, we may use the information indefinitely without further notice to you.
DATA TRANSFER
AutoZone’s Products and Services governed by this Privacy Policy are intended and made available to individuals in the United States of America only. While our Websites and Apps are accessible from anywhere in the world by anyone who is interested in AutoZone, Duralast Parts, and AutoZone Pro, we do not sell or make available any Products or Services associated with these companies to individuals outside of the United States, including the European Union.
If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer and store the data, including Personal Information, in the United States and process it there. The data protection laws in the United States are likely different from the country where you live. If you are located in the European Union, be aware that U.S. data protection laws are deemed by the European Commission to provide inadequate protection of Personal Information as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Your submission of such Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer.
DATA SECURITY
The security of your data is important to us but remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. By using our Websites, Apps, and Services, you acknowledge that there are data security and privacy limitations inherent to the use of the Internet, and that the security, integrity, and privacy of the Personal Information exchanged between you and AutoZone, or between you and other related entities, cannot be guaranteed. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or that we store, and you do so at your own risk.
We use third-party payment processors to process any transactions you make with AutoZone via our Websites and Apps. The processing of those transactions is governed by the payment processors' privacy statement and security practices. AutoZone is not responsible for the third-party payment processors' data security practices.
OUR POLICY ON “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE PROTECTION ACT (“CALOPPA”)
We do not support Do Not Track (“DNT”). Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser. We may track consumers' online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. As mentioned above, you can modify your browser's settings to change its acceptance of tracking technologies.
Third-parties may collect data that relates to you. We cannot control third-parties' responses to Do Not Track signals or other such mechanisms. Third-parties' use of data relating to you and responsiveness to Do Not Track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies.
YOUR CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATE LAW PRIVACY RIGHTS
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents are afforded certain rights related to their information under these state laws. AutoZone informs you that, where applicable under relevant law, individuals may be entitled to the following:
Right to Know (Access / Disclosure):
to have access to your Personal Information upon simple request – that is, you may receive a copy of such data upon receipt of a verifiable request, along with other information related to the collection or processing.
Right to Disclosure of Direct Marketers:
to have knowledge of and access to, upon simple request, and free of charge, the categories and names of addresses of third parties that have received Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. Please see the “Direct Marketers Disclosure” section below for more information.
Collecting, Selling, Sharing, or Disclosing Personal Information:
upon receipt of a verifiable request, to obtain a list of:
The specific pieces of your Personal Information AutoZone holds;
The categories of Personal Information collected about you, sold to third parties, or disclosed to third parties for business purposes;
The categories of Personal Information shared or sold within the last 12 months;
The categories of sources from which Personal Information is collected;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal Information; and
The categories of third parties with whom Personal Information is shared, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose.
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale and Sharing of Personal Information:
You may have the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information under certain circumstances. As noted elsewhere, AutoZone only shares your Personal Information through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies. To opt-out of the sharing of Personal Information through cookies and tracking technologies, go to
Cookie Settings.
Right to Request Deletion:
To obtain the deletion of your Personal Information in the situations set forth by applicable data protection law and upon receipt of a verifiable request. In complying with your request to delete your Personal Information, AutoZone will also notify third-parties who may have received your Personal Information. Certain exceptions might apply to prevent the deletion if retaining your Personal Information is required by law.
Right to Correct Inaccurate Information:
To request correction of inaccurate Personal Information, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes for which the Personal Information is processed. We use commercially reasonable efforts to correct this information.
Right to Data Portability:
To have your Personal Information directly transferred by us to a third-party processor of your choice (where technically feasible; may be limited to situations when processing is based on your consent).
Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information:
To request that AutoZone limit the use of your sensitive information to fulfill a specified purpose (i.e., to provide ordered goods or services).
Right to Non-Discrimination.
As defined under relevant law, you have a right to non-discrimination in the Services or quality of Services you receive from us for exercising your rights.
Submitting a Verifiable Data Subject Request to AutoZone
As mentioned above, certain state residents have certain rights to access, delete, or otherwise control the use, collection, and/or disclosure of their Personal Information. AutoZone will respond to an individual's “verifiable request” to exercise their rights under such laws – that is, where AutoZone has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and AutoZone has been able to verify the individual's identity. The need to verify an individual's identity is critical to protecting your Personal Information and ensuring that your Personal Information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf.
You may submit a verifiable request via our Website or toll-free number listed in the “Exercising Your State Law Privacy Rights” section below or as otherwise provided on our Websites and Apps (if such means are available). AutoZone will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity as part of this process. This information may include your name, your address, your account information, and any other information deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you. Once we have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a timely manner. Please note there may be some situations in which we are unable to fulfill your request, such as if we cannot find any information about you within our systems. Additionally, we may not be able to honor a deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is necessary to fulfill your order with us or meet a legal obligation. We will inform you whether we can fulfill your rights request.
We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity. We will not share your information or honor other requests in those situations in which we are unable to verify your identity.
Under certain state laws, a consumer can appoint an “authorized agent” to make certain verifiable requests on their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the consumer's information. Because the security and privacy of your information is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your applicable rights under relevant law in such situations. This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information. We will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without authorization. We will not share your information or honor any other requests in those situations where you cannot or do not grant permission in writing for an identified authorized agent to act on your behalf, or where we cannot independently verify your identity.

This Privacy Policy applies to AutoZone, Inc. and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and other related entities that link to this Privacy Policy from their websites, including Duralast Parts and AutoZone Pro (collectively referred to as “AutoZone,” “us,” “we,” or “our”). It describes our privacy practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you, your household, and the device you use when you interact with us (“Personal Information”), whether you are an existing, former, or potential customer. We typically collect your Personal Information when you:
Use of our websites, including mobile websites –

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information, derived information, or unique identifier that identifies, relates to, describes, or can be reasonably linked or associated with a particular consumer, device, or household.
The data collection and use practices for the AutoZone Websites are largely similar to how AutoZone collects customer information when you use the Apps or visit our Store locations. However, there may be some differences between how the App collects and uses your information and how information is collected and used by the Websites or in our Stores. These differences will be identified throughout this policy.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third-parties, including our third-party partners, service providers, and advertisers, even when those services are branded as, or provided on behalf of, AutoZone. When you access a third-party website through links on our Websites, the collection of your information by those third-parties is governed by their respective privacy policies. Please read the privacy policies of those third-parties carefully.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We may collect the following categories of information to provide our Products and Services, communicate with you about the Products or Services you have requested or that we think may be of interest to you, enhance our Products, Services, and operations, and for other operational, legal, and compliance purposes:
Identifier Information:
This includes information that can identify you, your household, or the device you use to access our digital content, such as your name, address, zip code, telephone number, email address, and information about your automobile (e.g., Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), engine, year, make, and model). We may also collect your payment information, such as credit card details and billing address, when you buy Products in our Stores and on our Websites. Note that your payment card information is collected directly and securely by our payment card processor, and AutoZone does not store your payment card information. We may collect government-issued ID for certain types of transactions—please provide this information only if requested. When you create an online account with us, we collect your log in credentials provided or created by you. We may also collect online identifiers, such as your IP address, when you browse our Websites or use our Apps.
Commercial information:
This includes information about Products or Services you purchased or considered purchasing, purchase history, Products or Services you like, reviews you submit, or locations where you shop.
Business Information:
AutoZone Pro serves business customers. For our AutoZone Pro customers, we collect business-related information, including business contact information, financial account information for transactions, commercial vehicle information, and other business-related details. Additionally, we may collect contact information related to the representative of a business customer, information related to their role within the company, and details related to their "AutoZone Commercial" Account, including the log in credentials.
Device, Website, and Email Interaction Information:
This includes information about your online activities such as browsing history, search history, website pages viewed, App usage, whether an email is opened, timestamps of activities, and other interaction details with our Websites, Apps, and emails. We also collect device information, IP address, browser or operating system details, login credentials, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, mobile device type, and other interaction-related information. In some cases, this information may be used or combined in a way that identifies you, the device you use, your household, your company, or your role within the company, and in those cases will be treated as Personal Information under applicable laws.
Geolocation Data:
This includes precise geolocation data if you configure your device or browser to allow this information to be collected.
Audio, Electronic or Visual Information:
This includes audio or video recordings and transcripts when you call us or visit our Stores (although we may not always be able to associate this information with you), or through our interactive chat functions, email, or SMS/MMS communications.
Inferences or Preferences:
We infer your interests and preferences based on the information (or combination of information) we have about you. We do so to better understand customer behavior, preferences, and needs. By analyzing data such as purchase history, demographics, and interactions with our Websites, we can identify the trends and patterns that can help us tailor our marketing strategies to meet the needs and preferences of our customers more efficiently.
Anonymized or Aggregated Information:
AutoZone may anonymize Personal Information to render it incapable of identifying an individual or household, typically for statistical purposes. For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Website feature. Once Personal Information is anonymized or aggregated, it can no longer be used to identify the individual.
Personal Information Collected over the Last 12 Months:
AutoZone has not collected any other types of Personal Information over the last 12 months.
Children's Information:
We do not knowingly collect or disclose Personal Information from children under the age of 16 without parental or guardian consent. If a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us so the information can be deleted.
Employee and Job Candidate Information:
We may collect additional information from employees or job candidates through job applications, benefits enrollment, and payroll or direct deposit enrollment. We maintain a separate collection notice and privacy policy for employees and job applicants, available on our internal web portal or job posting website.

Third Party Cookies.
AutoZone permits third-party business partners, such as advertisers, social media networks and analytics providers, to use cookies or other similar technologies on our Websites. These companies include Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube, Google Analytics and Bing Ads. They may collect your information, track your behavior on our Websites or Apps, and gather information about your use of our Apps, Websites, emails, and other online Services over time and across different Services to deliver targeted ads on our behalf. These companies may simultaneously provide similar services for other businesses. We are not responsible for the functioning of cookies and other technologies used and placed by third-parties on your device. You can disable these cookies on your device. See Your Cookies and Tracking Data Choices section below.
Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, and Transparent GIFs.
Pixel trackers and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on our Apps, Websites, and in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you open an email from us or access our Websites, the pixel trackers and web beacons generate a notice of that action.

Aggregated Data
AutoZone also collects, stores, and uses aggregate data that does not contain Personal Information, such as demographics or statistical information. This aggregate data may be shared with and used by third parties to help AutoZone and its suppliers better understand and serve our customers.
Categories of Personal Information Recipients
We disclose your Personal Information with the following categories of recipients. They are granted access to your information only to perform the tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Service / Fulfillment Providers:
We employ third-party fulfillment, shipment, transportation, and/or delivery providers, companies, individuals, and agents under contract with AutoZone to facilitate and help us provide our Products and Services to you (“Service Providers”). These Service Providers perform tasks or functions on our behalf, provide fulfillment and other services, or assist us in analyzing how our Products and Services are used or delivered. For instance, we will share your name and address with product suppliers and delivery companies as necessary to fulfill your orders with AutoZone. We pass on the payment card information that you provide to us either in Store or online to our payment card processors to fulfill your order. We share your account information with those providers that help us manage our AutoZone Rewards and other customer loyalty programs. We also disclose your Personal Information to our database and cloud storage providers that help us maintain our Websites and other systems.
Other AutoZone Entities:
We may share or disclose your information to other entities affiliated with AutoZone (e.g., ALLDATA, AutoZone Mexico)
Marketing Partners:
We may provide your Personal Information to our Marketing Partners to help us provide information about our Products and Services to you, including promotions or coupons we think you may be interested in. Often this information is masked in such a way that it does not directly identify you; however, we may share your Personal Information with such Marketing Partners on occasion.
Categories of Personal Information Disclosed for AutoZone Pro Business Purposes
AutoZone Pro is a business-to-business service for our commercial customers, not for individual customers. Therefore, the majority of information shared is your business information or device and Website interaction information as it relates to your role within your company. Frequently, business information identifies you as an individual as well, such as if your business is a proprietorship, or if you use your personal cell phone or email for business purposes. Sharing such business information becomes equivalent to sharing your Personal Information. Most importantly, we need to share your name, address, payment information, the items you have requested to purchase, and any other information related to your order with those fulfillment providers necessary to complete your order (such as our payment card processor, and our shipment, transportation, and/or delivery providers). We may at times need to share certain device and Website interaction information, such as your IP address and/or browser information, in relation to maintaining our Websites, providing you with ads or other marketing material, or providing other Services. This Business Information or device and Website interaction information may be used in a manner that may reasonably identify or be linked to you as an individual.
Categories of Personal Information Shared or Sold
AutoZone does not sell or share its customers' Personal Information or business information for monetary gain.
As described in the Cookies & Tracking Data section above, third-party cookies and other tracking technologies may be deployed on our Websites to collect device and Website interaction information. You may opt out of these third-party cookies and tracking technologies designed to deliver targeted advertising by using the methods provided in the Your Cookies and Tracking Data Choices section above.
AutoZone does not knowingly collect the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16.
Please note that a “sale” of Personal Information does not include instances when such information is part of a merger, acquisition, or other transaction involving all or part of our business. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or other business transaction, we may transfer your Personal Information to a third-party as part of that transaction. If such a transaction affects the manner in which your Personal Information is processed, we will notify you of such a change prior to its implementation.
DATA RETENTION
Your Personal Information will be retained in accordance with our Record Retention Policy. Generally, we will only keep your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Our Retention Policy for Personal Information is based on several factors including the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which your Personal Information is collected and processed, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
We also may retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief period, except in cases where they are used for Website safety and security, to improve Website functionality, or where we are legally obligated to retain them for longer periods. We may be required to keep your Personal Information longer due to legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may also retain your Personal Information longer if there is a complaint or if we can reasonably anticipate a legal dispute arising from our relationship with you. If a specific regulation applies to the retention of your Personal Information, that regulation takes precedence over our Retention Policy.
In some circumstances, we will anonymize or aggregate your Personal Information for research or statistical purposes. Once Personal Information is anonymized or aggregated, it can no longer be associated with an individual person. In that case, we may use the information indefinitely without further notice to you.
DATA TRANSFER
AutoZone’s Products and Services governed by this Privacy Policy are intended and made available to individuals in the United States of America only. While our Websites and Apps are accessible from anywhere in the world by anyone who is interested in AutoZone, Duralast Parts, and AutoZone Pro, we do not sell or make available any Products or Services associated with these companies to individuals outside of the United States, including the European Union.
If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer and store the data, including Personal Information, in the United States and process it there. The data protection laws in the United States are likely different from the country where you live. If you are located in the European Union, be aware that U.S. data protection laws are deemed by the European Commission to provide inadequate protection of Personal Information as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Your submission of such Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer.
DATA SECURITY
The security of your data is important to us but remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. By using our Websites, Apps, and Services, you acknowledge that there are data security and privacy limitations inherent to the use of the Internet, and that the security, integrity, and privacy of the Personal Information exchanged between you and AutoZone, or between you and other related entities, cannot be guaranteed. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or that we store, and you do so at your own risk.
We use third-party payment processors to process any transactions you make with AutoZone via our Websites and Apps. The processing of those transactions is governed by the payment processors' privacy statement and security practices. AutoZone is not responsible for the third-party payment processors' data security practices.
OUR POLICY ON “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE PROTECTION ACT (“CALOPPA”)
We do not support Do Not Track (“DNT”). Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser. We may track consumers' online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. As mentioned above, you can modify your browser's settings to change its acceptance of tracking technologies.
Third-parties may collect data that relates to you. We cannot control third-parties' responses to Do Not Track signals or other such mechanisms. Third-parties' use of data relating to you and responsiveness to Do Not Track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies.
YOUR CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATE LAW PRIVACY RIGHTS
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents are afforded certain rights related to their information under these state laws. AutoZone informs you that, where applicable under relevant law, individuals may be entitled to the following:
Right to Know (Access / Disclosure):
to have access to your Personal Information upon simple request – that is, you may receive a copy of such data upon receipt of a verifiable request, along with other information related to the collection or processing.
Right to Disclosure of Direct Marketers:
to have knowledge of and access to, upon simple request, and free of charge, the categories and names of addresses of third parties that have received Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. Please see the “Direct Marketers Disclosure” section below for more information.
Collecting, Selling, Sharing, or Disclosing Personal Information:
upon receipt of a verifiable request, to obtain a list of:
The specific pieces of your Personal Information AutoZone holds;
The categories of Personal Information collected about you, sold to third parties, or disclosed to third parties for business purposes;
The categories of Personal Information shared or sold within the last 12 months;
The categories of sources from which Personal Information is collected;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal Information; and
The categories of third parties with whom Personal Information is shared, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose.
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale and Sharing of Personal Information:
You may have the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information under certain circumstances. As noted elsewhere, AutoZone only shares your Personal Information through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies. To opt-out of the sharing of Personal Information through cookies and tracking technologies, go to
Cookie Settings.
Right to Request Deletion:
To obtain the deletion of your Personal Information in the situations set forth by applicable data protection law and upon receipt of a verifiable request. In complying with your request to delete your Personal Information, AutoZone will also notify third-parties who may have received your Personal Information. Certain exceptions might apply to prevent the deletion if retaining your Personal Information is required by law.
Right to Correct Inaccurate Information:
To request correction of inaccurate Personal Information, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes for which the Personal Information is processed. We use commercially reasonable efforts to correct this information.
Right to Data Portability:
To have your Personal Information directly transferred by us to a third-party processor of your choice (where technically feasible; may be limited to situations when processing is based on your consent).
Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information:
To request that AutoZone limit the use of your sensitive information to fulfill a specified purpose (i.e., to provide ordered goods or services).
Right to Non-Discrimination.
As defined under relevant law, you have a right to non-discrimination in the Services or quality of Services you receive from us for exercising your rights.
Submitting a Verifiable Data Subject Request to AutoZone
As mentioned above, certain state residents have certain rights to access, delete, or otherwise control the use, collection, and/or disclosure of their Personal Information. AutoZone will respond to an individual's “verifiable request” to exercise their rights under such laws – that is, where AutoZone has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and AutoZone has been able to verify the individual's identity. The need to verify an individual's identity is critical to protecting your Personal Information and ensuring that your Personal Information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf.
You may submit a verifiable request via our Website or toll-free number listed in the “Exercising Your State Law Privacy Rights” section below or as otherwise provided on our Websites and Apps (if such means are available). AutoZone will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity as part of this process. This information may include your name, your address, your account information, and any other information deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you. Once we have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a timely manner. Please note there may be some situations in which we are unable to fulfill your request, such as if we cannot find any information about you within our systems. Additionally, we may not be able to honor a deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is necessary to fulfill your order with us or meet a legal obligation. We will inform you whether we can fulfill your rights request.
We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity. We will not share your information or honor other requests in those situations in which we are unable to verify your identity.
Under certain state laws, a consumer can appoint an “authorized agent” to make certain verifiable requests on their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the consumer's information. Because the security and privacy of your information is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your applicable rights under relevant law in such situations. This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information. We will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without authorization. We will not share your information or honor any other requests in those situations where you cannot or do not grant permission in writing for an identified authorized agent to act on your behalf, or where we cannot independently verify your identity.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information, derived information, or unique identifier that identifies, relates to, describes, or can be reasonably linked or associated with a particular consumer, device, or household.
The data collection and use practices for the AutoZone Websites are largely similar to how AutoZone collects customer information when you use the Apps or visit our Store locations. However, there may be some differences between how the App collects and uses your information and how information is collected and used by the Websites or in our Stores. These differences will be identified throughout this policy.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third-parties, including our third-party partners, service providers, and advertisers, even when those services are branded as, or provided on behalf of, AutoZone. When you access a third-party website through links on our Websites, the collection of your information by those third-parties is governed by their respective privacy policies. Please read the privacy policies of those third-parties carefully.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of ALLDATA LLC or our international subsidiaries and affiliates, including ALLDATA Europe, ALLDATA Canada, AutoZone Mexico, and AutoZone Brazil. You can find the applicable descriptions of their privacy practices by clicking on the links available on the websites operated by them or by checking the settings menus of their mobile Apps.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We may collect the following categories of information to provide our Products and Services, communicate with you about the Products or Services you have requested or that we think may be of interest to you, enhance our Products, Services, and operations, and for other operational, legal, and compliance purposes:

This includes information that can identify you, your household, or the device you use to access our digital content, such as your name, address, zip code, telephone number, email address, and information about your automobile (e.g., Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), engine, year, make, and model). We may also collect your payment information, such as credit card details and billing address, when you buy Products in our Stores and on our Websites. Note that your payment card information is collected directly and securely by our payment card processor, and AutoZone does not store your payment card information. We may collect government-issued ID for certain types of transactions—please provide this information only if requested. When you create an online account with us, we collect your log in credentials provided or created by you. We may also collect online identifiers, such as your IP address, when you browse our Websites or use our Apps.

This includes information about Products or Services you purchased or considered purchasing, purchase history, Products or Services you like, reviews you submit, or locations where you shop.
Business Information:

Additionally, we may collect contact information related to the representative of a business customer, information related to their role within the company, and details related to their "AutoZone Commercial" Account, including the log in credentials.
Device, Website, and Email Interaction Information:
This includes information about your online activities such as browsing history, search history, website pages viewed, App usage, whether an email is opened, timestamps of activities, and other interaction details with our Websites, Apps, and emails. We also collect device information, IP address, browser or operating system details, login credentials, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, mobile device type, and other interaction-related information. In some cases, this information may be used or combined in a way that identifies you, the device you use, your household, your company, or your role within the company, and in those cases will be treated as Personal Information under applicable laws.

Inferences or Preferences:
We infer your interests and preferences based on the information (or combination of information) we have about you. We do so to better understand customer behavior, preferences, and needs. By analyzing data such as purchase history, demographics, and interactions with our Websites, we can identify the trends and patterns that can help us tailor our marketing strategies to meet the needs and preferences of our customers more efficiently.
Anonymized or Aggregated Information:
AutoZone may anonymize Personal Information to render it incapable of identifying an individual or household, typically for statistical purposes. For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Website feature.

AutoZone has not collected any other types of Personal Information over the last 12 months.

Categories of Personal Information Recipients
We disclose your Personal Information with the following categories of recipients. They are granted access to your information only to perform the tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Service / Fulfillment Providers:
We employ third-party fulfillment, shipment, transportation, and/or delivery providers, companies, individuals, and agents under contract with AutoZone to facilitate and help us provide our Products and Services to you (“Service Providers”). These Service Providers perform tasks or functions on our behalf, provide fulfillment and other services, or assist us in analyzing how our Products and Services are used or delivered. For instance, we will share your name and address with product suppliers and delivery companies as necessary to fulfill your orders with AutoZone. We pass on the payment card information that you provide to us either in Store or online to our payment card processors to fulfill your order. We share your account information with those providers that help us manage our AutoZone Rewards and other customer loyalty programs. We also disclose your Personal Information to our database and cloud storage providers that help us maintain our Websites and other systems.
Other AutoZone Entities:
We may share or disclose your information to other entities affiliated with AutoZone (e.g., ALLDATA, AutoZone Mexico)
Marketing Partners:
We may provide your Personal Information to our Marketing Partners to help us provide information about our Products and Services to you, including promotions or coupons we think you may be interested in. Often this information is masked in such a way that it does not directly identify you; however, we may share your Personal Information with such Marketing Partners on occasion.
Categories of Personal Information Disclosed for AutoZone Pro Business Purposes
AutoZone Pro is a business-to-business service for our commercial customers, not for individual customers. Therefore, the majority of information shared is your business information or device and Website interaction information as it relates to your role within your company. Frequently, business information identifies you as an individual as well, such as if your business is a proprietorship, or if you use your personal cell phone or email for business purposes. Sharing such business information becomes equivalent to sharing your Personal Information. Most importantly, we need to share your name, address, payment information, the items you have requested to purchase, and any other information related to your order with those fulfillment providers necessary to complete your order (such as our payment card processor, and our shipment, transportation, and/or delivery providers). We may at times need to share certain device and Website interaction information, such as your IP address and/or browser information, in relation to maintaining our Websites, providing you with ads or other marketing material, or providing other Services. This Business Information or device and Website interaction information may be used in a manner that may reasonably identify or be linked to you as an individual.
Categories of Personal Information Shared or Sold
AutoZone does not sell or share its customers' Personal Information or business information for monetary gain.
As described in the Cookies & Tracking Data section above, third-party cookies and other tracking technologies may be deployed on our Websites to collect device and Website interaction information. You may opt out of these third-party cookies and tracking technologies designed to deliver targeted advertising by using the methods provided in the Your Cookies and Tracking Data Choices section above.
AutoZone does not knowingly collect the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16.
Please note that a “sale” of Personal Information does not include instances when such information is part of a merger, acquisition, or other transaction involving all or part of our business. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or other business transaction, we may transfer your Personal Information to a third-party as part of that transaction. If such a transaction affects the manner in which your Personal Information is processed, we will notify you of such a change prior to its implementation.
DATA RETENTION
Your Personal Information will be retained in accordance with our Record Retention Policy. Generally, we will only keep your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Our Retention Policy for Personal Information is based on several factors including the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which your Personal Information is collected and processed, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
We also may retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief period, except in cases where they are used for Website safety and security, to improve Website functionality, or where we are legally obligated to retain them for longer periods. We may be required to keep your Personal Information longer due to legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may also retain your Personal Information longer if there is a complaint or if we can reasonably anticipate a legal dispute arising from our relationship with you. If a specific regulation applies to the retention of your Personal Information, that regulation takes precedence over our Retention Policy.
In some circumstances, we will anonymize or aggregate your Personal Information for research or statistical purposes. Once Personal Information is anonymized or aggregated, it can no longer be associated with an individual person. In that case, we may use the information indefinitely without further notice to you.
DATA TRANSFER
AutoZone’s Products and Services governed by this Privacy Policy are intended and made available to individuals in the United States of America only. While our Websites and Apps are accessible from anywhere in the world by anyone who is interested in AutoZone, Duralast Parts, and AutoZone Pro, we do not sell or make available any Products or Services associated with these companies to individuals outside of the United States, including the European Union.
If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer and store the data, including Personal Information, in the United States and process it there. The data protection laws in the United States are likely different from the country where you live. If you are located in the European Union, be aware that U.S. data protection laws are deemed by the European Commission to provide inadequate protection of Personal Information as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Your submission of such Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer.
DATA SECURITY
The security of your data is important to us but remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. By using our Websites, Apps, and Services, you acknowledge that there are data security and privacy limitations inherent to the use of the Internet, and that the security, integrity, and privacy of the Personal Information exchanged between you and AutoZone, or between you and other related entities, cannot be guaranteed. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or that we store, and you do so at your own risk.
We use third-party payment processors to process any transactions you make with AutoZone via our Websites and Apps. The processing of those transactions is governed by the payment processors' privacy statement and security practices. AutoZone is not responsible for the third-party payment processors' data security practices.

We do not support Do Not Track (“DNT”). Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser. We may track consumers' online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. As mentioned above, you can modify your browser's settings to change its acceptance of tracking technologies.
Third-parties may collect data that relates to you. We cannot control third-parties' responses to Do Not Track signals or other such mechanisms. Third-parties' use of data relating to you and responsiveness to Do Not Track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies.
YOUR CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATE LAW PRIVACY RIGHTS
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents are afforded certain rights related to their information under these state laws. AutoZone informs you that, where applicable under relevant law, individuals may be entitled to the following:
Right to Know (Access / Disclosure):
to have access to your Personal Information upon simple request – that is, you may receive a copy of such data upon receipt of a verifiable request, along with other information related to the collection or processing.
Right to Disclosure of Direct Marketers:
to have knowledge of and access to, upon simple request, and free of charge, the categories and names of addresses of third parties that have received Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. Please see the “Direct Marketers Disclosure” section below for more information.
Collecting, Selling, Sharing, or Disclosing Personal Information:
upon receipt of a verifiable request, to obtain a list of:
The specific pieces of your Personal Information AutoZone holds;
The categories of Personal Information collected about you, sold to third parties, or disclosed to third parties for business purposes;
The categories of Personal Information shared or sold within the last 12 months;
The categories of sources from which Personal Information is collected;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal Information; and
The categories of third parties with whom Personal Information is shared, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose.
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale and Sharing of Personal Information:
You may have the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information under certain circumstances. As noted elsewhere, AutoZone only shares your Personal Information through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies. To opt-out of the sharing of Personal Information through cookies and tracking technologies, go to
Cookie Settings.
Right to Request Deletion:
To obtain the deletion of your Personal Information in the situations set forth by applicable data protection law and upon receipt of a verifiable request. In complying with your request to delete your Personal Information, AutoZone will also notify third-parties who may have received your Personal Information. Certain exceptions might apply to prevent the deletion if retaining your Personal Information is required by law.
Right to Correct Inaccurate Information:
To request correction of inaccurate Personal Information, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes for which the Personal Information is processed. We use commercially reasonable efforts to correct this information.
Right to Data Portability:
To have your Personal Information directly transferred by us to a third-party processor of your choice (where technically feasible; may be limited to situations when processing is based on your consent).
Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information:
To request that AutoZone limit the use of your sensitive information to fulfill a specified purpose (i.e., to provide ordered goods or services).
Right to Non-Discrimination.
As defined under relevant law, you have a right to non-discrimination in the Services or quality of Services you receive from us for exercising your rights.
Submitting a Verifiable Data Subject Request to AutoZone
As mentioned above, certain state residents have certain rights to access, delete, or otherwise control the use, collection, and/or disclosure of their Personal Information. AutoZone will respond to an individual's “verifiable request” to exercise their rights under such laws – that is, where AutoZone has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and AutoZone has been able to verify the individual's identity. The need to verify an individual's identity is critical to protecting your Personal Information and ensuring that your Personal Information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf.
You may submit a verifiable request via our Website or toll-free number listed in the “Exercising Your State Law Privacy Rights” section below or as otherwise provided on our Websites and Apps (if such means are available). AutoZone will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity as part of this process. This information may include your name, your address, your account information, and any other information deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you. Once we have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a timely manner. Please note there may be some situations in which we are unable to fulfill your request, such as if we cannot find any information about you within our systems. Additionally, we may not be able to honor a deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is necessary to fulfill your order with us or meet a legal obligation. We will inform you whether we can fulfill your rights request.
We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity. We will not share your information or honor other requests in those situations in which we are unable to verify your identity.
Under certain state laws, a consumer can appoint an “authorized agent” to make certain verifiable requests on their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the consumer's information. Because the security and privacy of your information is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your applicable rights under relevant law in such situations. This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information. We will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without authorization. We will not share your information or honor any other requests in those situations where you cannot or do not grant permission in writing for an identified authorized agent to act on your behalf, or where we cannot independently verify your identity.

Third Party Cookies.
AutoZone permits third-party business partners, such as advertisers, social media networks and analytics providers, to use cookies or other similar technologies on our Websites. These companies include Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube, Google Analytics and Bing Ads. They may collect your information, track your behavior on our Websites or Apps, and gather information about your use of our Apps, Websites, emails, and other online Services over time and across different Services to deliver targeted ads on our behalf.

We are not responsible for the functioning of cookies and other technologies used and placed by third-parties on your device. You can disable these cookies on your device.

Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, and Transparent GIFs.
Pixel trackers and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on our Apps, Websites, and in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you open an email from us or access our Websites, the pixel trackers and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure responses to our communications and improve our Websites.

We collect various types of information using other technologies to improve the quality of our Websites and the Products and Services we provide. For example, we may collect usage data and other information about the device you use to access our Apps and Websites, your operating system and/or mobile device type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.

Aggregated Data
AutoZone also collects, stores, and uses aggregate data that does not contain Personal Information, such as demographics or statistical information. This aggregate data may be shared with and used by third parties to help AutoZone and its suppliers better understand and serve our customers.
Categories of Personal Information Recipients
We disclose your Personal Information with the following categories of recipients. They are granted access to your information only to perform the tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Service / Fulfillment Providers:
We employ third-party fulfillment, shipment, transportation, and/or delivery providers, companies, individuals, and agents under contract with AutoZone to facilitate and help us provide our Products and Services to you (“Service Providers”). These Service Providers perform tasks or functions on our behalf, provide fulfillment and other services, or assist us in analyzing how our Products and Services are used or delivered. For instance, we will share your name and address with product suppliers and delivery companies as necessary to fulfill your orders with AutoZone. We pass on the payment card information that you provide to us either in Store or online to our payment card processors to fulfill your order. We share your account information with those providers that help us manage our AutoZone Rewards and other customer loyalty programs. We also disclose your Personal Information to our database and cloud storage providers that help us maintain our Websites and other systems.
Other AutoZone Entities:
We may share or disclose your information to other entities affiliated with AutoZone (e.g., ALLDATA, AutoZone Mexico)
Marketing Partners:
We may provide your Personal Information to our Marketing Partners to help us provide information about our Products and Services to you, including promotions or coupons we think you may be interested in. Often this information is masked in such a way that it does not directly identify you; however, we may share your Personal Information with such Marketing Partners on occasion.
Categories of Personal Information Disclosed for AutoZone Pro Business Purposes
AutoZone Pro is a business-to-business service for our commercial customers, not for individual customers. Therefore, the majority of information shared is your business information or device and Website interaction information as it relates to your role within your company. Frequently, business information identifies you as an individual as well, such as if your business is a proprietorship, or if you use your personal cell phone or email for business purposes. Sharing such business information becomes equivalent to sharing your Personal Information. Most importantly, we need to share your name, address, payment information, the items you have requested to purchase, and any other information related to your order with those fulfillment providers necessary to complete your order (such as our payment card processor, and our shipment, transportation, and/or delivery providers). We may at times need to share certain device and Website interaction information, such as your IP address and/or browser information, in relation to maintaining our Websites, providing you with ads or other marketing material, or providing other Services. This Business Information or device and Website interaction information may be used in a manner that may reasonably identify or be linked to you as an individual.
Categories of Personal Information Shared or Sold
AutoZone does not sell or share its customers' Personal Information or business information for monetary gain.
As described in the Cookies & Tracking Data section above, third-party cookies and other tracking technologies may be deployed on our Websites to collect device and Website interaction information. You may opt out of these third-party cookies and tracking technologies designed to deliver targeted advertising by using the methods provided in the Your Cookies and Tracking Data Choices section above.
AutoZone does not knowingly collect the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16.
Please note that a “sale” of Personal Information does not include instances when such information is part of a merger, acquisition, or other transaction involving all or part of our business. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or other business transaction, we may transfer your Personal Information to a third-party as part of that transaction. If such a transaction affects the manner in which your Personal Information is processed, we will notify you of such a change prior to its implementation.
DATA RETENTION
Your Personal Information will be retained in accordance with our Record Retention Policy. Generally, we will only keep your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Our Retention Policy for Personal Information is based on several factors including the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which your Personal Information is collected and processed, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
We also may retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief period, except in cases where they are used for Website safety and security, to improve Website functionality, or where we are legally obligated to retain them for longer periods. We may be required to keep your Personal Information longer due to legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may also retain your Personal Information longer if there is a complaint or if we can reasonably anticipate a legal dispute arising from our relationship with you. If a specific regulation applies to the retention of your Personal Information, that regulation takes precedence over our Retention Policy.
In some circumstances, we will anonymize or aggregate your Personal Information for research or statistical purposes. Once Personal Information is anonymized or aggregated, it can no longer be associated with an individual person. In that case, we may use the information indefinitely without further notice to you.
DATA TRANSFER
AutoZone’s Products and Services governed by this Privacy Policy are intended and made available to individuals in the United States of America only. While our Websites and Apps are accessible from anywhere in the world by anyone who is interested in AutoZone, Duralast Parts, and AutoZone Pro, we do not sell or make available any Products or Services associated with these companies to individuals outside of the United States, including the European Union.
If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer and store the data, including Personal Information, in the United States and process it there. The data protection laws in the United States are likely different from the country where you live. If you are located in the European Union, be aware that U.S. data protection laws are deemed by the European Commission to provide inadequate protection of Personal Information as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Your submission of such Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer.
DATA SECURITY
The security of your data is important to us but remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. By using our Websites, Apps, and Services, you acknowledge that there are data security and privacy limitations inherent to the use of the Internet, and that the security, integrity, and privacy of the Personal Information exchanged between you and AutoZone, or between you and other related entities, cannot be guaranteed. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or that we store, and you do so at your own risk.
We use third-party payment processors to process any transactions you make with AutoZone via our Websites and Apps. The processing of those transactions is governed by the payment processors' privacy statement and security practices. AutoZone is not responsible for the third-party payment processors' data security practices.
OUR POLICY ON “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE PROTECTION ACT (“CALOPPA”)
We do not support Do Not Track (“DNT”). Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser. We may track consumers' online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. As mentioned above, you can modify your browser's settings to change its acceptance of tracking technologies.
Third-parties may collect data that relates to you. We cannot control third-parties' responses to Do Not Track signals or other such mechanisms. Third-parties' use of data relating to you and responsiveness to Do Not Track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies.
YOUR CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATE LAW PRIVACY RIGHTS
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents are afforded certain rights related to their information under these state laws. AutoZone informs you that, where applicable under relevant law, individuals may be entitled to the following:
Right to Know (Access / Disclosure):
to have access to your Personal Information upon simple request – that is, you may receive a copy of such data upon receipt of a verifiable request, along with other information related to the collection or processing.
Right to Disclosure of Direct Marketers:
to have knowledge of and access to, upon simple request, and free of charge, the categories and names of addresses of third parties that have received Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. Please see the “Direct Marketers Disclosure” section below for more information.
Collecting, Selling, Sharing, or Disclosing Personal Information:
upon receipt of a verifiable request, to obtain a list of:
The specific pieces of your Personal Information AutoZone holds;
The categories of Personal Information collected about you, sold to third parties, or disclosed to third parties for business purposes;
The categories of Personal Information shared or sold within the last 12 months;
The categories of sources from which Personal Information is collected;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal Information; and
The categories of third parties with whom Personal Information is shared, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose.
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale and Sharing of Personal Information:
You may have the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information under certain circumstances. As noted elsewhere, AutoZone only shares your Personal Information through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies. To opt-out of the sharing of Personal Information through cookies and tracking technologies, go to
Cookie Settings.
Right to Request Deletion:
To obtain the deletion of your Personal Information in the situations set forth by applicable data protection law and upon receipt of a verifiable request. In complying with your request to delete your Personal Information, AutoZone will also notify third-parties who may have received your Personal Information. Certain exceptions might apply to prevent the deletion if retaining your Personal Information is required by law.
Right to Correct Inaccurate Information:
To request correction of inaccurate Personal Information, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes for which the Personal Information is processed. We use commercially reasonable efforts to correct this information.
Right to Data Portability:
To have your Personal Information directly transferred by us to a third-party processor of your choice (where technically feasible; may be limited to situations when processing is based on your consent).
Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information:
To request that AutoZone limit the use of your sensitive information to fulfill a specified purpose (i.e., to provide ordered goods or services).
Right to Non-Discrimination.
As defined under relevant law, you have a right to non-discrimination in the Services or quality of Services you receive from us for exercising your rights.
Submitting a Verifiable Data Subject Request to AutoZone
As mentioned above, certain state residents have certain rights to access, delete, or otherwise control the use, collection, and/or disclosure of their Personal Information. AutoZone will respond to an individual's “verifiable request” to exercise their rights under such laws – that is, where AutoZone has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and AutoZone has been able to verify the individual's identity. The need to verify an individual's identity is critical to protecting your Personal Information and ensuring that your Personal Information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf.
You may submit a verifiable request via our Website or toll-free number listed in the “Exercising Your State Law Privacy Rights” section below or as otherwise provided on our Websites and Apps (if such means are available). AutoZone will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity as part of this process. This information may include your name, your address, your account information, and any other information deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you. Once we have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a timely manner. Please note there may be some situations in which we are unable to fulfill your request, such as if we cannot find any information about you within our systems. Additionally, we may not be able to honor a deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is necessary to fulfill your order with us or meet a legal obligation. We will inform you whether we can fulfill your rights request.
We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity. We will not share your information or honor other requests in those situations in which we are unable to verify your identity.
Under certain state laws, a consumer can appoint an “authorized agent” to make certain verifiable requests on their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the consumer's information. Because the security and privacy of your information is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your applicable rights under relevant law in such situations. This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information. We will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without authorization. We will not share your information or honor any other requests in those situations where you cannot or do not grant permission in writing for an identified authorized agent to act on your behalf, or where we cannot independently verify your identity.
