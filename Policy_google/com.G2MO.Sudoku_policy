By using the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy, as may be modified by us from time to time.
We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating at the top of this Policy the date it was last updated.

WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
"Personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address), and information about that individual's activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, or geographic area, and your preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you use the Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail, phone number, and other contact and demographic information when, enter into a contest or sweepstakes, request services or contact us for any reason. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic information, contact information, or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys and other activities on the Site.
When you visit the Site, some information also may be automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring Web site, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or "clear gifs." Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. Clear gifs (also know as Web bugs or Web beacons) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in e-mails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site. If we combine cookies or clear gifs with or link them to any of the personally identifying information, we would treat this information as personal information. The Site may contain links to third-party Web sites. These third parties may place cookies, clear gifs or other devices on your computer to collect non-personal information, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties.� This policy does not apply to, nor are we responsible for, cookies or clear gifs in any third party advertisement, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.� If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, you may not be able to access certain Site features or services.
