In addition to the information collection and sharing practices described above, Luna website properties and mobile applications may use common tracking technologies like browser cookies, "Local Shared Objects" (such as "Flash" cookies), analytical tools, device IDs, or other technologies. We also collect certain technical information about the device you use to access our site or services, such as user-agent, time stamp, hardware type, language and time zone settings, IP address, OS type and version, and installed fonts.
If you click on links to a third-party site, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of those websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third-party sites.
Some operating system developers, such as Apple, allow mobile application users to request deletion of accounts created within an application. If you request deletion of your account, Luna may still retain your information for legal, auditing, regulatory and business purposes. Retention periods vary according to specific legal, auditing, regulatory and business needs.
A request to delete an account within the mobile application only applies to the credentials and account you created within the Application and not to any other accounts you may have with Luna.
