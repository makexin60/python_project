App Privacy Policy
Last updated November 15, 2024
Inyo Media LLC (“we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you access our mobile application titled “ABCs and First Reader” (the “Application”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.
We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.
COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
We do not collect information about you via the Application.
Personal Data:
We do not collect demographic and other personally identifiable information (such as your name and email address) via the Application.
Derivative Data:
When you access the Application, your native actions are not recorded or collected. The Application does not contain functionality to interact with other users or social media of any kind.
Financial Data:
We do not collect or store any financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g. valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date) your purchases, orders, returns, or exchanges. All financial information is stored by the third-party online/mobile store from which you purchased the Application, and you are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions.

The Application does not contain functionality to interact with social media or social networks (such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.), and we therefore do not collect user information from social networking sites, including your name, your social network username, location, gender, birth date, email address, profile picture, or public data for contacts.

By Law or to Protect Rights:
If we believe our participation is necessary to respond to a legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we will participate as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
