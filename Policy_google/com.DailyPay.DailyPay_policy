Welcome to the DailyPay movement!
Welcome to DailyPay! DailyPay, LLC (“DailyPay,” “our,” “us” or “we”) provides a platform to employers that enables employees and other service providers to access on-demand pay securely, seamlessly, and compliantly. The DailyPay Solution is a comprehensive suite of pay experience capabilities designed to revolutionize pay processes for employees and employers. DailyPay also makes available Friday by DailyPay™ which is a general purpose reloadable card and mobile application, and the DailyPay Card, which is a general purpose reloadable card.
We want you to completely understand what we do, how we do it, and what is required of you. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a contract and explain things you should know about using our websites,
www.dailypay.com
and
https://friday.dailypay.com
(together, the “Site”), our mobile applications (the “Mobile Apps”), and our related applications and technologies (collectively, including the Site, the Mobile Apps, and updated or new features and functionality, the “Services”).  By using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services and you must close your account to access the Site and the Mobile Apps (“DailyPay account”).
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION, AND FURTHER (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, (2) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND (3) YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US RESOLVED BY A JURY OR IN A COURT OF LAW.
Other Languages: We may offer you a version of these Terms in another language to facilitate your understanding of these Terms, but in case of disputes or controversies, the English version will prevail.
The Services include the “DailyPay Program,” a service that enables an employee or service provider to access earnings arising from regular pay with no-fee and transaction fee options. If you are a DailyPay Program participant, the DailyPay Program Terms (“
Program Terms
”) supplement these Terms and govern your participation in the DailyPay Program. The Services also include “DailyPay Cycle Payment,” a service that allows an employee or service provider of a participating business to access other amounts the business owes to the employee or service provider, such as net bonus pay, incentive pay, expense reimbursements, termination pay, and other off-cycle amounts that do not arise from the regular wage, fee, or salary payment cycle. If you participate in DailyPay Cycle Payment, the DailyPay Cycle Payment Terms (“
Cycle Payment Terms
”) supplement these Terms and govern your use of the DailyPay Cycle Payment. The Services also include Friday by DailyPay, and the DailyPay Card, both of which are Visa® prepaid cards that provide users with no-fee, instant on-demand pay. The Friday Card and the DailyPay Card can also be used to access ATMs, load cash and withdraw money, and make online or in-store purchases anywhere Visa® debit cards are accepted. Friday Card and DailyPay Card holders will also be subject to a separate cardholder agreement. Banking services for the Friday Card and the DailyPay Card are provided by The Bancorp Bank, N.A., Member FDIC. The Services also include “DailyPay Reward Payment,” which allows the service provider of a participating Hiring Entity (as defined herein) to access amounts the Hiring Entity designates as incentive or bonus payments in DailyPay Reward Payment. If you participate in DailyPay Reward Payment, the DailyPay Reward Payment Terms (“
Reward Payment Terms
”) supplement these terms and govern your use of the DailyPay Reward Payment.

2. Additional Terms; Changes; Account Closure
DailyPay may offer you Services, such as the DailyPay Program, DailyPay Cycle Payment, the Friday Card, the DailyPay Card, and DailyPay Reward Payment, which are subject to additional terms and conditions that are available on the Site or otherwise made available to you separately from these Terms (“Additional Terms”). The Program Terms, Cycle Payment Terms, and Reward Payment Terms are examples of Additional Terms. If there is a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control with respect to the conflict.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms and any Additional Terms. We will post the changes on the Site or otherwise make available to you any changes, and will indicate at the top of this page the date these Terms were last revised. Your continued use of the Services will constitute your acceptance of any changes. If required by applicable law, we will send you advance notice prior to making any changes effective.
If you wish to close your DailyPay account, you may do so through the Site or the applicable Mobile App by changing your DailyPay account settings. If you have any difficulty doing so, you may email us a request for assistance at:
support@dailypay.com
. An account closure request will become effective after we carry out the request. An account closure has no effect on your duties to us, all of which survive the closure and the expiration or termination for any reason of these Terms or any Additional Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Friday Card nor the DailyPay Card is a “DailyPay account” hereunder and is instead held by the issuing bank for the card; cancellation of the Friday Card or the DailyPay Card is governed by the terms of the applicable cardholder agreement.

THE SERVICES INFORMATION AND THE SERVICES ARE FURNISHED “AS IS,” “AT YOUR OWN RISK,” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED AND DISCLAIMED. FURTHER, DAILYPAY DOES NOT WARRANT THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR THAT THE SERVICES (AND ANY SERVER THAT MAKES THE SERVICES AVAILABLE) WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR BUGS.

21. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration – For Users Entering Into These Terms in an Individual Capacity
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
(a) Agreement to Arbitrate
This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You and we agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and DailyPay, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or the Additional Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between you and us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you or we may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and DailyPay are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
(b) Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
YOU AND DAILYPAY AGREE THAT EACH OF YOU AND US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND DAILYPAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR MAKES A FINDING THAT A CLAIM OR DEFENSE WAS FRIVOLOUS OR WITHOUT A GOOD FAITH FACTUAL OR LEGAL BASIS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF SOUGHT BY EITHER PARTY (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
(c) Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
DailyPay is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at
support@dailypay.com
.
If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to DailyPay should be sent to 55 Water St. Floor 42 New York, NY 10041, ATTN: Legal (“Notice Address”), with a copy to
legal@dailypay.com
. The Notice must sufficiently (i) describe the nature and factual basis of the claim or dispute, (ii) set forth the specific relief sought, (iii) identify yourself by name, address, email address and other identifying information that may be necessary for DailyPay to verify your account, (iv) be sent by or on behalf of you individually, and not as a part of a collective or mass notice of a dispute that is combined with a Notice for or on behalf of any other party, and (v) be sent within one (1) year of any dispute arising under this Agreement. If DailyPay and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or DailyPay may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by DailyPay or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or DailyPay is entitled.
(d) Arbitration Procedures
You agree that arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, and with the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules in the instance that twenty-five (25) or more similar arbitration demands are received by DailyPay (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Unless DailyPay and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, DailyPay agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
(e) Coordinated Claims
If twenty-five (25) or more similar arbitration demands are filed on behalf of persons represented by the same or coordinated counsel, or the claims are reasonably expected to be coordinated given the similar nature of the claims, the claims shall proceed in arbitration in a coordinated proceeding. DailyPay and counsel for claimants shall each select ten (10) claims to proceed in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding before the same arbitrator(s) to promote efficiency and cost savings for the parties. The remaining claims shall not be filed in arbitration and shall be tolled from the date notice is given until the arbitration is terminated, the parties settle, the bellwether claimants opt out of arbitration, the claimants opt out of mediation, or you opt-out of the coordinated proceedings, whichever event is earliest. If following the bellwether arbitration any claims still remain and have not been withdrawn or otherwise resolved, the results of the bellwether proceedings shall be given to a mediator who the parties jointly select. The mediator shall conduct a global mediation so that the parties may attempt to resolve all remaining claims. If the global mediation is unsuccessful, the parties shall each select another thirty (20) claims to proceed in a second bellwether proceeding, and (if necessary) subsequent mediation (subject to any modifications jointly agreed upon by the parties in writing). If the parties fail to reach a global settlement, claimants may proceed to individual arbitration. If the parties reach a global settlement, claimants may choose to opt out of this settlement and proceed to individual arbitration or asset claims in small claims court, if eligible.
(f) Costs of Arbitration
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.  To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either DailyPay or you under the AAA Rules, DailyPay and you shall split them equally, provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, DailyPay will advance or pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, DailyPay will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive compared to the costs of litigation. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, applicable law, and this Arbitration Agreement.
(g) 30-Day Right to Opt Out for Consumers Who Reside in South Carolina
If you are a consumer residing in South Carolina, you have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement to:
support@dailypay.com
.
Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used for the EWA Program, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
(h) Confidentiality
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
(i) Severability
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.
(j) Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, DailyPay agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending DailyPay written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address or email address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
22. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration – For Users Entering Into These Terms on Behalf of an Entity
You and DailyPay intend that these Terms and the Additional Terms are to be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to any conflict-of-law or choice-of-law rules, and that the rule of construction that provides that a document is construed against the maker thereof be inapplicable in the construction of any of the terms of these Terms or the Additional Terms.  Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Additional Terms, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined through confidential binding arbitration in New York, New York before one arbitrator. The confidential binding arbitration shall be administered by AAA pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and you and DailyPay shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the award, including the hearing.  Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
