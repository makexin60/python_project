Children’s Personal Information:
Pioneer Work’s Site is a general audience website and is not designed for persons under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information or provide Services to any person under the age of 16. If a user submits personal information and is suspected of being younger than the age of 16, Pioneer Works will terminate Services to that user and take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
How We Use Cookies:
When you access our Site, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called “cookies” on your computer. We and our service providers also use cookies to customize the Services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over time. Most browsers support cookies, but you can set your browser to decline them and can delete them whenever you like. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better Site, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. You can obtain more information about cookies by visiting
http://www.allaboutcookies.org
.
What Types of Cookies We Use:
We may use the following types of cookies to provide our Site and Services:
Functionality Cookies, which include preference and user experience related cookies, are used to provide services or to remember choices you make so we can personalize our content for you (for example, by remembering your username, choice of language, schedule preferences). Our use of Functionality Cookies includes remembering preferences you have chosen to customize your experience of our Site or providing live chat functionality to you across our Websites through Intercom, ZenDesk or other similar services. These cookies last until removed by your browser.
Analytical Cookies are used to analyze user activity in order to improve the Site and Services. For example, we can use Analytical Cookies to look at the use of different sections of the Site and Services and aggregate patterns based on actions that you might perform.
Testing and Performance Improvement Cookies are used to ensure users receive a consistent user experience, such as conducting A/B testing on certain aspects of our Site, in order to improve our product offerings. We also use Testing and Performance Improvement Cookies to improve the performance and reliability of our Site.
Marketing Cookies may be used from third-party service providers such as Google and Facebook for marketing purposes. Marketing Cookies allow us to display promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet. We may also share information about your behavior on the Site with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.
Opting Out of Cookie Usage:
If you want to control which cookies you accept, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered by a website's server. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. You may find that some parts of the site will not function properly if you have refused cookies. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some features of the Site and Services.

help@joinhomebase.com
.
Opting Out of Text Message Communications:
You may opt-out of text messaging at any time by replying to any message with STOP. This will end the communications from that particular phone number. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing text messages from other phone numbers managed by us, and you may opt out of those in a similar fashion.
Aggregated Personal Information:
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Pioneer Works often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the personal information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Pioneer Works may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Pioneer Works may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
How We Protect Your Information:
The security of your personal information is important to us, and we implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices in order to protect it from unauthorized access, use, modification, or disclosure. Our measures include firewalls, data encryption, SSL encryption, physical and electronic access controls, and strict rules regarding the access and use of data on our system. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of information we have collected from you.
How To Update Your Information:
You may update, correct, or delete your account information and preferences at any time by accessing your account settings page on the Service. Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. If we receive a request under this provision, we will acknowledge it within seventy-two (72) business hours and handle it in most cases within thirty (30) days. If you are otherwise unable to update your information via the account settings page, please contact us as at
help@joinhomebase.com
. We will take reasonable steps to update, remove or correct your information in our possession that you have previously submitted via the Services.
Declining To Share Your Information:
You may decline to share certain personal information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service enabled by the provision of such personal information. Pioneer Works will not discriminate against you for exercising any rights you may have under applicable federal or state law.

The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
The categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold;
The categories of third parties to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the Personal Data; and
The specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you.
The right to request we delete personal information we have collected about you.
In certain instances, Pioneer Works may have legal requirements which require we keep such data.
The right to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties providing cross-context behavioral advertising.

Pioneer Works will not retaliate against you should you choose to exercise your rights.
