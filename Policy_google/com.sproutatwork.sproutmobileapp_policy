How We Collect Your Personal Information
From your Program Provider:
As part of your eligibility for the Services, your employer or other entity who invited you to join the provider service under their subscription (“Program Provider”) may provide the provider with certain information about you. This may include the information necessary to verify your identity when you register for the Services and to manage your account on an ongoing basis, and such other information as may be provided by your Program Provider. If you do not want the provider to receive this information, please contact your Program Provider and ask them to stop sending the provider any information about you. Please note that this may make you ineligible to participate in the Program.
Directly from You:
You may provide Personal Information directly to the provider. You may do so by entering information directly into the Service, engaging with the Service, responding to questionnaires or surveys, or similar.
Through automated technologies or interactions with devices you choose to synch with the Service:
You can choose to allow certain wearable devices and mobile applications to sync data to the Service. You can modify these permissions at any time through the connected devices setting of the Services. Further, when you access our website or otherwise use the Service, we may automatically collect your Technical Data and User Data. The data are typically collected through the use of server log files or web log files, mobile device software development kits and tracking technologies like browser cookies.
With Whom We Share your Personal Information
We may share your Personal Information as follows:
Your Program Provider: We
may share with your Program Provider the necessary information for them to administer your incentives, to manage your account and to otherwise act as Service administrator. We will share information directly with Your Program Provider only to the extent needed for the administration of your incentives, such as calculation of health plan premium discounts, applicable taxation, reward redemption, or other arrangements for which such information is relevant. Where we reasonably believe that there may be a risk of imminent harm to you or someone else and we reasonably believe that your Program Provider is best placed to act, we may also share such information with your Program Provider. We may also share aggregated or de-identified information with other providers to your Program Provider at the request of your Program Provider.
For US users:  if your Program Provider is considered a Covered Entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we may be obligated to disclose any information collected on the platform.
Third-Party Service Providers (or, Processors):
Your information may be disclosed, stored and/or transferred (or otherwise made available) to our affiliates and other third parties who provide services on our behalf such as email services. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions and are not authorized to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. Our service providers are contractually bound to use Your Personal Information as instructed by us only and they are required to have as stringent data security mechanisms as we have.
Legal and Compliance.
We and our service providers may provide your Personal Information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to another organization for the purposes of investigating a breach of an agreement or contravention of law or detecting, suppressing or preventing fraud, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable Canadian, US or other law or legal process. Your Personal Information may also be disclosed where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and to investigate or prevent actual or suspected loss or harm to persons or property.
Sale or Merger.
Personal Information may be provided to third parties in connection with a business transaction, including a merger or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of the provider or as part of a corporate reorganization, or stock or asset sale, or other change in corporate control, including for the purpose of determining whether to proceed or continue with such transaction or business relationship.
Aggregated Data
. We may create and share aggregated data that does not identify you with third parties and the public in a variety of ways. When we provide this information, we take technical measures to ensure that the data does not identify you and cannot be associated back to you.
Personal Information of Minors
Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 16 and We do not knowingly collect any personal information from such children. Children under the age of 16 should not use our Services at any time. In the event that We learn that We have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 16, We will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.
Your Legal Rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. You may have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Information
. This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you
. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.
Request erasure of your Personal Information
. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no legitimate basis for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your Personal Information
where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information
. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the information's accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information
to you or to a third party
. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information
. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the details set out below.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures in an effort to safeguard the Personal Information in our custody and control against theft, loss and unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure. We restrict access to your personal information on a need-to-know basis to employees and authorized service providers who require access to fulfill their job requirements.
For user accounts registered directly with the provider profile information is protected by the password each member uses to access their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your account, the website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”).
While We take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If your third-party site account is hacked, this may lead to the unauthorized use of the provider service you have registered to use, so be careful to keep your account information secure. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please contact Us at
privacyhealth@telus.com
.
Our Retention of Your Information
We have Personal Information retention processes designed to retain Personal Information for no longer than necessary for the purposes stated above or to otherwise meet legal requirements. For more information about our retention processes, please contact Us at
privacyhealth@telus.com
.
International Transfers
Your Personal Information may be transferred outside the jurisdiction in which you are situated and may become subject to the laws of the receiving jurisdiction, which may differ from the laws of your jurisdiction. For any Personal Information of European Data Subjects that we collect and process outside the European Economic Area, we rely on robust data processing agreements containing Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or other approved or legal method, and that it is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Third-Party Links
Our Services may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. We do not endorse, review and we are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other websites. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Services and another entity may collect Personal Information from you.

Notice
We encourage complainants to use the OPC’s electronic on-line complaint filing service.
Learn how to file a complaint about how a business mishandled your personal information.
The
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act
(
PIPEDA
) sets out the rules for how private sector organizations collect, use or disclose your personal information. It also gives you the right to see the information held about you, with a few exceptions, and to request corrections.
If you think an organization covered by this Act is not living up to its legal responsibilities, you have the right to file a formal complaint.

1. Check whether the
PIPEDA
applies
PIPEDA
applies to many private-sector organizations in Canada, but not all. For example, Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec have private-sector legislation similar to
PIPEDA
. These acts may apply if the information is collected, used and disclosed entirely within the province.
PIPEDA
only applies when personal information is collected, used or disclosed by an organization
during a commercial activity
, except in a few rare cases.
PIPEDA
does not apply to not-for-profit and charity groups, associations or political parties unless the organization is conducting a commercial activity. Fundraising is not considered a commercial activity.
