Our Policy
Tickets once sold cannot be exchanged, cancelled, rescheduled or
              refunded.
Payment Methods
Paytm Ticketnew accepts Master Card and Visa credit and debit
              cards. We also accept payment through net-banking and cash cards,
              we are in the process of adding more payment options to provide
              you with the convenience in the near future. Paytm Ticketnew does
              not offer any refunds or exchanges of tickets purchased on Paytm
              Ticketnew website or via phone. In addition, tickets purchased
              through Paytm Ticketnew will be subject to a non-refundable
              per-ticket convenience charge. Before purchasing your tickets we
              insist you to confirm the title, time and location of the movie
              you wish to see. Paytm Ticketnew will place an order for your
              tickets in our ticketing system, reducing the number of seats
              available for the chosen show time. While this allows us to
              provide our customers with the clear benefit of guaranteed seats,
              it prevents Paytm Ticketnew and our event partners from reselling
              tickets in the event you do not attend your chosen show time. The
              Credit Card needs to be presented at the counter at the time of
              collection of the ticket(s). Please read the online and email
              confirmation pages carefully, as they provide you with important
              information about retrieving your tickets that may be unique to
              your chosen event, movie and theatre. The confirmation pages and
              email have your confirmation number. Just take your confirmation
              number with you to the venue along with a photo id and the credit
              card used for the booking. We respect the privacy of our users and
              the importance of the information they entrust to us. We may

Who You Are Buying From
Paytm Ticketnew acts as the agent to those who are promoting or
              otherwise providing the events for which you purchase tickets,
              such as venues, teams and event promoters. Paytm Ticketnew
              generally is just a services provider with respect to the sale.
Pricing and Availability
Paytm Ticketnew sells tickets on behalf of theatres, promoters,
              teams, bands and venues, event organisers which means Paytm
              Ticketnew does not set the ticket prices or determine seating
              locations. The cost of the tickets displayed in the respective
              events, theatres directly comes from the theatre live booking
              system, Paytm Ticketnew does not approve or set the pricing of
              tickets. Most distribution points generally access the same
              ticketing system and inventory. Therefore, tickets for popular
              movies, events may sell out quickly. Occasionally, additional
              tickets may be available prior to the event. However, Paytm
              Ticketnew does not control this inventory or its availability.
Order Confirmation
If you do not receive a confirmation number (in the form of a
              confirmation page or email or SMS) after submitting payment
              information, or if you experience an error message or service
              interruption after submitting payment information, it is your
              responsibility to confirm with us whether or not your order has
              been placed. Only you may be aware of any problems that may occur
              during the purchase process. Paytm Ticketnew will not be
              responsible for losses (monetary or otherwise) if you assume that
              an order was not placed because you failed to receive
              confirmation.
Cancelled and Postponed Events
Tickets to Cancelled/Postponed Events will not be refund by Paytm
              Ticketnew.
Refunds and Exchanges

              selection. Policies set forth by our clients, including venues,
              teams and theaters, generally prohibit Paytm Ticketnew from
              issuing exchanges or refunds after a ticket has been purchased or
              for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets.
