Information Collection
Types of Information
Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
Includes details like your name, email address,
        birthdate, and other information that can identify you.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII):
Includes aggregated or anonymous data that
        does not identify you personally.
Automatically Collected Information
We automatically collect information about your interactions with the Site and Services, including device type, IP
      address, browser type, operating system, access times, pages viewed, and ads clicked. Cookies may be used to
      enhance your experience, but you can disable them through your browser settings.
Information You Provide
When you create a profile, we may collect your username, email address, birthdate, gender, and other details you
      choose to share. If you choose not to provide certain information, we may not be able to create your profile.
      Photos you upload (including private photos) may reveal your identity and can be accessed by authorized users.
Information from Third Parties
We may also collect information from third-party sources, including linked accounts like Facebook, depending on
      your privacy settings on those platforms.
Use and Sharing of Information
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We use Non-PII to personalize your experience, make your profile searchable, and deliver relevant ads. We may
      share Non-PII with third parties, including advertisers and consultants, for research and service improvement
      purposes.
Personally Identifiable Information
Your credit card information is processed through third-party services (e.g., Apple iTunes or Google Play). In
      these cases, their privacy policies govern the use of your PII. We do not share PII with advertisers, even if you
      click on ads displayed on the Site.
Third-Party Advertisers and Social Websites
Radi may display third-party advertisements. Clicking on these ads may redirect you to other websites, which are
      not under our privacy control. We may also access certain information from social sites (like Facebook) based on
      your privacy settings on those platforms. We encourage you to review and adjust these settings as necessary.
Legal Requirements and Safety
We may disclose your PII if required by law, court order, or to protect the safety and property of our users or
      the public. This includes scenarios where you provide false information or impersonate someone else.
Sale or Merger
If Radi undergoes a sale, merger, or other business transformation, PII may be transferred as part of the business
      assets.
Additional Policies
Do Not Track Signals
Radi respects “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals. You can set your browser to indicate that you do not want certain
      information collected about you.
Retention of Your Information
We retain your information as long as your profile is active or hidden. If your account remains inactive for over
      24 months, your PII will be deleted unless retention is required for legal or backup purposes.
Unsolicited Contact (Spam)
Radi does not send unsolicited emails. You can opt out of emails at any time. If you receive any unsolicited
      emails that appear to be from us, please report them immediately.
Monitoring Online Behavior
While we generally do not monitor private communications, we reserve the right to do so if there is suspicion of
      policy violations. Publicly submitted content is subject to review, and inappropriate content may be removed.
Security
We employ industry-standard practices to protect your PII, including encryption and firewalls. However, due to the
      inherent uncertainties of the internet, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Access to PII
You control your PII and can request access, correction, or deletion by editing your profile or contacting us at
