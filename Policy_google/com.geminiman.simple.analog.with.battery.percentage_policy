“Never look at someone's flaws and judge or leave, see the good within, after all everone has flaws even you...” — Dante
Hi everyone,
I hope you all are doing great,
GeminiMan here, aka XDA-Dante63,
I am an ethical software engineer, love to see people have access to many things and features...
I also love to see people enjoy things without being upset because of data being collected or ads being spammed on the screen...
I am happy to say that I am starting a hobby to develop WatchFaces with passion for your guys to enjoy using...
I might develop few apps as well if time allows, because apps tend to take longer time compared to WatchFaces...
Regards,
Dante
In order to release any app to the PlayStore, I need to include Privacy Policy explaining everything about the developed apps...
As a Software Engineer and Security Analyst, I take privacy and security of every user very seriously when it comes to using anything I release. I know how irritating and frustrating it is to see permissions of an app to access certain things without explaination, leaving you in the blank uncertain if anything is being collected, what is being collected or not, and if collected, why and is it being shared or not and so on...
I, GeminiMan, the developer, want you to rest assured that everything I develop, you will see me explaing what permissions have been used and explaing the role of those permissions in the PlayStore app description, I have no intentions to collect any data nor display any ads in my developed apps...
Link to the privacy policy of Google Play Services that is most likely involved in every developed app:

If you have any further questions, you can send me an email or reach me on any of my social medias and I will respond whenever I can...

Yours sincerely,
Dante
I am open to collab with anyone now (Mainly watchfaces designs),
I won't charge for anything, and I will look into whether the collab idea can be done or not...
As I am a small content creator, I would be happy if I become more known to the world (aside from XDA),
I will shout out to you in the play store description, and it would be nice to have a shout back...
I will never charge or take any credits for anything that is not mine...
You can reach me anywhere for a collab,
Regards,
Dante
