By turning them on, you agree to our processing of your personal information in relation to such features. If you do not provide such information, the additional features you request may not be available to you. This, however, does not affect your use of the basic features.
Please note that we usually consider the region that you select during your initial sign-in (or that you select subsequently through "Settings") as the actual place where the products and services are used and the jurisdiction whose laws and regulations we comply with, including those relating to data protection.
1.1.1 Categories of information we may collect
The following describes the information we may collect in connection with features and services.
1.1.1.1 Basic features and services

We do not collect your personal information while you are browsing online through the App.
(2) Version upgrading
To let you upgrade the App, we need to collect the App ID, App version, your area code, and your phone's language settings so that we can use such information to detect and download the latest available version of the App. To let you upgrade the firmware of your smart device paired with the App, we need to collect the smart device's ID and version information, the App version, the smart device's MAC address, your area code, and your phone's language settings so that we can use such information to detect and download the latest available firmware version for the smart device
. If you do not provide the aforementioned information, you will not be able to upgrade the App or the firmware of the smart device.

We will collect your profile picture, sex, display name, date of birth, height, and weight so that we can effectively calculate your health data based on the collected information
. When relevant smart devices are connected to the App, the sex, date of birth, height, and weight you have entered or will enter in the App or your call logs on your phone may be synced to the relevant smart wearable devices for more accurate data monitoring and App usage statistics.
(3) Device pairing, device management, and device information widgets
You can pair smart devices (such as smart home devices, which include safety protection devices, lighting fixtures, energy-saving devices, and appliances, or wearable devices, which include bands, watches, and body fat scales) with the App for easy device management. To this end,
we need to collect the names and MAC addresses of such devices so that we can establish a Bluetooth connection between such devices and your phone to successfully pair them to the App, thus allowing you to manage their settings, display the source of their data, control and manage them, and check their working status and usage data. Such information will also enable us to not only collect the usage statistics of such devices and related services but also improve their quality
.
You can go to the "My Devices" feature page to view information about the smart devices paired with the App, including their connection status.
(4) Device sharing

if you specify the location as a trigger condition to automate the relevant smart devices in your home to perform the specified action, we need to obtain your location information
. When you specify leaving or arriving at a specific place as a condition to trigger an auto scene,
we use the location information we collected to realize the geofencing function, which allows us to determine the distance between the specified place and your current location and figure out whether you have left or entered the specified place
. For example, you can configure your air conditioner to automatically turn on/off when you enter/leave your home. When you specify "When outdoor weather changes" as a condition to trigger an auto scene, we use your location information to determine the weather near the place you specified. For example, you may configure a room light to automatically turn on at sunset.

We have also established relevant internal control processes to ensure compliance with the principle of least privilege. We strictly control access to personal information and only allow our employees and the personnel of authorized service providers to access such personal information on a need-to-know basis to help us process such information. Such employees and personnel are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to perform these obligations, they may be held legally liable, or their relationship with us may be terminated. Personal information access logs will be kept and audited periodically. We require that employees who need to access sensitive personal information should obtain permission from relevant management personnel. In addition, we take technical measures to prevent people from accessing, modifying, copying, or downloading such information without authorization.
(3) The security of your information is very important to us. Therefore, we will continue our efforts to ensure the security of your personal information and implement safeguards, such as encrypting stored data and using end-to-end encryption during transmission, to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. In addition, certain encrypted data is inaccessible to anyone other than the user.
(4) When transmitting and storing sensitive personal information or special categories of personal information about you, we will use security measures, such as encryption. Before storing your personal biometric information, we will take technical measures to process it, such as only storing a summary of your personal biometric information.
(5) We carefully select business partners and service providers and include our requirements for personal information protection in our business contracts, audits, or assessments.
(6) Internally, we publish and implement data security regulations to define the standards and requirements for protecting user data (including users' personal information).

We have established mechanisms to ensure smooth coordination and communication with regulators, third-party security service providers, and security evaluation and certification organizations to promptly defend against and deal with information security threats so as to protect your personal information and privacy.
4.2 Notification and response to personal information security events
Please note that although we take reasonable measures to protect your information, no websites, internet transfers, computer systems, or Wi-Fi connections are absolutely secure.
To respond to possible privacy risks such as leakage, corruption, or loss of personal information, we have developed a variety of mechanisms and measures to define personal information security events and procedures to deal with the events. We have set up a professional emergency response team responsible for personal information security plans to reduce losses caused by information security events, as well as to analyze, identify, and handle such events. The team also works with relevant departments to follow up on information security events in accordance with our regulations and requirements for dealing with personal information leakages.
In the event of any security breach of your personal information, we will promptly inform you of the event in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including the situation and the possible impact of the event, the measures taken or to be taken by us, suggestions on how you can prevent and reduce risks, and remedies available to you. We will promptly inform you of such information by email, letter, phone, or push notification. When it is difficult to inform the personal information subjects concerned one by one, we will publish an announcement in a reasonable and effective manner. We will also report the handling of the event in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities.
In the event of any security breach of your personal information, you can also directly contact us in the manner disclosed in this Privacy Notice.

6. How We Process Children's Personal Information
Most of our products, websites, and services are intended for adults, not for children (we regard people under the age of 14 or a similar minimum age defined in the relevant jurisdiction as children). We do not provide services directly to children.
If you are a child, you must obtain the consent of your parent or guardian before using the App, and be sure to carefully read this Privacy Notice together with them. Children may not use our products or services without the consent of their parents or guardians.
It is the responsibility of parents and guardians to supervise their children in the proper use of our products and services. If you are a parent or guardian of a child, we hope that you work with us to protect children's personal information and raise their personal information protection awareness and ability. You must ensure that your children use our products and/or services with your consent and under your guidance. Before assisting your children in using our products or services, you should carefully read this Privacy Notice together with them.

We do not actively collect, store, use, transfer, or disclose children's personal information, let alone use their personal information for marketing purposes.

We will try to delete the relevant data as soon as possible.

You can choose whether to access or use any website, product, or service provided by a third party. The operators of the third-party websites to which you are redirected through the links contained in our products or services and the providers of the third-party services have their own privacy policies. When you access a third-party website or use a third-party app or service, the website, app, or service may access and use your personal information.
We have no control over such third parties, and their access to and use of personal information about you are not under our control or subject to this Privacy Notice. We assume no responsibility or liability for their privacy policies and processing of personal information.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to require such third parties to take measures to protect your personal information, but we cannot guarantee that they will take protection measures as per our requirements. Therefore, before using their services, we strongly recommend that you carefully read their privacy policies to determine whether to use or continue to use such services.
The App may have integrated with certain software development kits (SDKs) or other similar applications from our authorized partners to enable you to use related services contained in the App. We carefully review the purposes for which the SDK providers use your personal information, assess their security capabilities, and bind them to a legal cooperation agreement. We conduct rigorous security checks to protect data security.
To secure your information to the maximum extent, we strongly recommend that you read the privacy terms for any third-party SDKs before using the services provided by such SDKs. If you find any risks associated with such SDKs or other similar applications, we recommend that you immediately stop using them and promptly contact us.
We may have also integrated other SDKs as tools into the App to implement specific product or service features. Please be aware that such SDKs do not collect any personal information or require any sensitive app permissions. For example, we have integrated OkHttp3 for making network requests, Glide for providing the image loading functionality, and JSON for formatting.

. How We Protect Your Personal Information
Our Data Protection Measures
We attach great importance to personal information security. We take reasonably practical and technical measures to protect the information we collect in connection with our services. We have used industry-standard security measures to protect the personal information you provide to prevent unauthorized access, public disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss of data. We take all reasonably practical measures to protect your personal information. In particular:
(1) We use mainstream security technologies such as SSL or TLS to encrypt many of our services. We regularly review practices regarding information collection, storage, and possessing (including physical security measures) to prevent unauthorized access or system tampering.
(2) Subject to relevant regulations, we have appointed a person in charge of personal information protection and set up a personal information protection task force. We have also established internal control processes to ensure compliance with the principle of least privilege. We strictly control access to personal information and only grant access permissions to our employees and the personnel of an authorized service provider, both of whom need to access personal information in order to help us process such information. The aforementioned employees and personnel are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to perform these obligations, they may be held legally liable or be terminated. Access logs of personal data will be recorded and audited regularly. We require that employees who need to access sensitive personal information should obtain permission from relevant management personnel. In addition, we take technical measures to prevent people from accessing, modifying, copying, or downloading such information without authorization.
(3) The security of your information is extremely important to us. Therefore, we endeavor to ensure the security of your personal information and implement safeguards such as full security encryption throughout storage and transmission to prevent your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. At the same time, no one can access the specific content of certain encrypted data except the users themselves.
(4) When transmitting and storing special categories of personal information, we will use security measures such as encryption. When storing your personal biometric information, we will take technical measures to process it, such as only storing a summary of your personal biometric information.
(5) We will strictly screen business partners and service providers and implement the requirements for personal information protection into the business contracts or audits, assessments, and other activities between both parties.
(6) Internally, we publish and implement data security regulations to define the standards and requirements for protecting user data (including users' personal information).

Notification and Response to Personal Information Security Incidents
Please note that although we have taken reasonable measures to protect your information, no websites, Internet transmissions, computer systems, or wireless connections are absolutely secure. To deal with possible risks such as personal data breaches, damage, and loss, we have developed various mechanisms and controls that clearly define personal information security incidents and the corresponding handling procedures. We have established a dedicated emergency response team responsible for personal data security planning, data loss mitigation, analysis, location and remediation, and follow-up operations with relevant departments in accordance with personal information leakage incident management norms and requirements.
In the event of a personal information security incident, we will act in accordance with applicable law, notify you and/or the competent data protection authority of any such security incident as required, and take measures to mitigate any risks arising therefrom.

If we decide to respond to your deletion request, we will also notify the entities that have obtained your personal information from us and require them to delete the data in a timely manner, unless otherwise required by law or regulations, or if those entities have your independent authorization.
Please understand that when you ask us to delete or anonymize your information,

You can contact us in the following ways:
• Go to our Data Subject Rights Platform available at
https://www.realme.com/global/privacy-feedback
to submit a request;
• Contact us using the contact information provided in the “Contact Us” section of this Policy.
(2) Response time
Subject to applicable legal provisions and where technically feasible, we will make every effort to verify your identity and complete the processing response within 15 working days of receiving your request (or within the period specified by the jurisdiction). Given the complexity and large amounts of individual requests and due to technical feasibility, this time limit might be extended when necessary. In the case of a delay in providing information, we will notify the personal information subject of the relevant circumstances and the reason for the delay. In the event of a conflict between the time limits set forth in this paragraph and the relevant laws and regulations, the provisions of the relevant laws and regulations will prevail.
(3) Miscellaneous
Please note that for security reasons, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In principle, we do not charge a fee for a reasonable amount of requests. However, for multiple and repetitive requests that exceed reasonable limits, we will charge a certain fee to cover some costs depending on the nature of the request. We may reject requests that are manifestly unfounded, unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requiring the development of new systems or fundamental changes to current practices), pose risks to the legitimate rights and interests of others, or are highly impractical. The reasons for this may be specified to you in our response. In addition, we may not respond to your request if laws or administrative rules specify that the data mentioned in your request must be kept confidential or does not need to be disclosed, or if your request would hinder government departments from performing their statutory duties, directly involves any issues that directly concern public interests such as national security, national defense, public health, and criminal investigations, or may result in serious damage to your legitimate rights and interests or those of any other individual or organization.
