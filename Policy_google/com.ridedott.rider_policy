Last Updated: 05 December 2024
At TIER-Dott, we are deeply committed to the protection of privacy rights, asserting that such rights should remain consistent, irrespective of one‚Äôs geographic location. Therefore, we categorize any information associated with an identifiable person, or that can be connected to an individual through TIER-Dott, as ‚Äúpersonal data,‚Äù regardless of where the person resides. This encompasses information that explicitly identifies an individual ‚Äî for example, their name ‚Äî as personal data, as well as information that might not directly reveal an individual‚Äôs identity but can reasonably be used for this purpose ‚Äî such as the IP address of their device. In the context of our Privacy Policy, aggregated information, which does not permit the identification of any individual, is defined as non-personal data.
This is the Privacy Statement of emTransit BV, encompassing all its entities, subsidiaries, branches, representative offices, affiliates, and other emTransit BV group companies (‚Äúhereinafter referred to as TIER-Dott‚Äù), and it governs our practices as long as we are engaged in the processing of personal data pertaining to individuals (‚Äò
you
‚Äò).
Your Privacy Rights at TIER-Dott
At TIER-Dott, we are dedicated to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring you have full control over your personal data. Your trust and security are paramount, and we are committed to protecting your personal data and ensuring your rights are respected.
Our commitment to your privacy includes granting you the following rights concerning your personal data:
Right to Access Information
You are entitled to request an overview of your personal data processed by us, along with a copy of this data, ensuring you‚Äôre fully informed about the information we hold about you.
Right to Rectification
Should you find your personal data in our possession to be inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or update it. In cases where your data has been shared with third parties, we will also inform them of any necessary amendments to ensure the accuracy of your information across all platforms.
Right to Object to Processing
You may object to the processing of your personal data if you believe our use of it is for our legitimate interests yet unjustifiably impacts you. Upon receiving an objection, we will assess the situation to determine if your rights override our processing activities. However, this right does not apply where the processing is a legal requirement or necessary for fulfilling a contract with you.
Rights Regarding Automated Decisions
TIER-Dott occasionally employs automated decision-making processes essential for entering into or performing a contract with you. You will be informed if such processes affect you, with the option to request a manual review of automated decisions, thereby ensuring fairness and accuracy.
Right to Restrict Processing
You can request that we limit the processing of your personal data under specific conditions, such as when the accuracy of the data is contested, its processing is unlawful, the data is no longer needed for processing, or while objections to processing based on legitimate interests are being evaluated.
Right to Data Portability
This right allows you to obtain your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transfer that data to another entity, where technically feasible, ensuring ease of access and the ability to move your data as needed.
Right to Erasure
Also known as the ‚Äòright to be forgotten,‚Äô this enables you to request the deletion of your personal data under certain circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary, its processing is objected to, it has been unlawfully processed, or when required by law.
Right to Complain
If you are dissatisfied with how we have handled your personal data or responded to your requests, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority, ensuring your concerns are addressed appropriately.
Exercising Your Rights
Requests may be denied if they do not meet specific criteria. In such cases, or if there is a delay in processing your request due to legal requirements or complexities, we will inform you of the reasons for denial or delay, ensuring transparency and communication throughout the process.
There are circumstances under which we may not be able to fulfill your request regarding your personal data. For instance, if you request the deletion of transaction data but TIER-Dott is under a legal obligation to retain records of that transaction to comply with laws, we must deny such requests. Similarly, requests that could compromise our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes may also be declined. This could occur if, for example, you ask for the deletion of an account currently under investigation for security reasons.
Other grounds for denying a privacy request include situations where complying with the request would infringe on the privacy rights of others, if the request is deemed frivolous or vexatious, or if fulfilling the request would pose an extreme impracticality. Our commitment to protecting the privacy and security of our users‚Äô data means we must carefully balance individual rights with legal obligations and the collective security of all users‚Äô information.
Personal Data TIER-Dott Collects from You
At TIER-Dott, we uphold the principle that exceptional products and robust privacy can coexist harmoniously. This philosophy motivates us to be judicious in our data collection practices, ensuring that we gather only the personal data necessary to adhere to data minimization principles while simultaneously delivering our services effectively and enhancing your experience.
Identity Data and Contact Data
This encompasses your first and last name, username and password, date of birth, and gender (only where required by law), as well as proof of identity like an identity card, passport, or driver‚Äôs license (also where required by law). In some jurisdictions, a live selfie may be required. Additionally, we collect your billing and delivery addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and other similar identifiers.
Financial and Transactional Data
We gather information related to your bank account and payment card details (note that we do not retain your full payment card details, which are stored by our trusted third-party payment processor), along with details of transactions and services you have purchased from us.
Technical and Usage Data
This includes details on how you interact with our Website, App, and Vehicles, such as your internet protocol (IP) address, login data, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access our services.
Geolocation and Telemetry Data
We collect data on how you use our Vehicles, including ride and geolocation history and telemetry information like braking, swerving, collisions, road surface conditions, speed, chosen path, and weight fluctuations.
Profile Data
This covers your purchases, interests, marketing and communication preferences, feedback, survey responses, and other data you provide.
User and Potential User Content
This includes information you submit when contacting customer support, or that we collect with your consent through participation in our User Research program or events, which might include feedback, photos, videos, or audio recordings.
Online Behavior and Device Information
TIER-Dott collects data about your online activities and information related to your devices. This includes the device ID of your mobile device and the details of the pages you visit within the TIER-Dott mobile application. This type of data helps us understand how you interact with our app, which in turn allows us to tailor and improve our services to better meet your needs and preferences.
Social Media Interactions
TIER-Dott monitors and engages with your interactions related to our brand on various social media platforms, including Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube. This encompasses tracking public messages, posts, likes, and responses to and about TIER-Dott across the internet.
Aggregated Data
We also process aggregated data for various purposes, such as statistical or demographic analysis. Though derived from your personal data, aggregated data does not reveal your identity directly or indirectly and thus is not considered personal data under the law. For instance, we might use aggregated technical and usage data to determine the percentage of users accessing a specific feature of our Website or App, or to understand vehicle usage patterns. The processing of such data falls outside the scope of this privacy policy since it does not regulate personal data.
How TIER-Dott Uses Your Personal Data

We utilize your personal data when you initiate an agreement with us or when it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations under these agreements.

Customer Feedback
We engage in customer satisfaction surveys and other activities to gather your views on our services. These are conducted via the App or email, helping us to continually improve and tailor our offerings to meet your needs.

Blacklisting
TIER-Dott may blacklist an account or a payment method when it determines that there has been fraudulent activity linked to it. Accounts and payment methods that have been blacklisted are kept on file to avoid any future fraudulent transactions. This list is not shared with any third parties and is only for internal use. The goal of this activity is to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect our users. If you would like to know more about this, please contact
privacy@ridedott.com

We consistently store your personal data within the European Union (EU) to ensure its protection under the rigorous standards of the GDPR. However, in exceptional cases where it becomes necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we take stringent measures to safeguard your information.
To ensure the protection of your personal data when it is shared outside of the EEA‚Äîwhether among TIER-Dott entities or with third-party service providers‚Äîwe adhere to several key safeguards:
Applicable Local Laws and Regulations:
We evaluate the local legal and regulatory frameworks of the country receiving the data to ensure they provide adequate protection for your personal data.
EU Model Clauses:
For transfers to countries where the legal framework may not offer equivalent protection, we incorporate
EU Model Clauses
into our agreements with service providers. These clauses are designed to ensure that any personal data leaving the EEA will be handled in compliance with the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), providing a consistent level of protection.
Adequacy Decisions by the European Commission:
We also rely on adequacy decisions made by the European Commission, which determine whether a non-EEA country offers an adequate level of data protection comparable to that within the EU. These decisions allow for the free transfer of data to countries deemed to have equivalent protective measures in place.
By employing these mechanisms, we strive to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of your personal data, ensuring it receives the highest level of protection, regardless of where it is processed.
Data Retention at TIER-Dott
At TIER-Dott, we are committed to handling your personal data responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We retain your personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in the section ‚ÄúHow TIER-Dott Uses Your Personal Data.‚Äù The specific retention periods for your personal data are detailed in the applicable local privacy statement, which may vary depending on the nature of the data and the reasons for its processing.
Retention Periods
The duration for which we keep your data depends on several factors, including:
For the Duration of User Accounts
We retain personal data essential for delivering our services for as long as your account remains active. This includes data like your account information, which is crucial for maintaining your access to our services.
Compliance with Legal Requirements
Certain types of data, such as trip information or records relevant for tax purposes, are retained for a period of 7 years to comply with legal obligations.
After an Account Deletion Request
Upon receiving a request to delete an account, we proceed to remove the user‚Äôs account and associated data from our systems. However, there are exceptions where we may need to retain specific data:
Safety, Security, and Fraud Prevention:
Some data may be retained to protect the safety and security of our services and our users, or for fraud prevention purposes.
Compliance with Legal Obligations:
We may also retain data as required by law or to comply with legal requirements, ensuring we adhere to our legal responsibilities.
Outstanding Issues:
If there are unresolved issues related to your account, such as outstanding balances or disputes, we may retain necessary data until these issues are resolved.
TIER-Dott takes data privacy and protection seriously, ensuring that our data retention practices are transparent and designed to respect your privacy while fulfilling our legal and operational obligations.
