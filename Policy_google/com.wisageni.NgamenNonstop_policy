We reserve all rights in and to the App not expressly granted to you under these Terms.
6. Payment Terms
6.1. In-App purchases
Wisageni Studio may license to you certain virtual goods to be used within the Apps and which you may purchase with real cash or which you may earn or redeem via gameplay (“Virtual Items”). When you obtain such Virtual Items from Wisageni Studio or its authorized designee, you receive a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license to use such Virtual Items within the applicable App and solely for non-commercial use.
Wisageni Studio may manage, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. Without limiting the foregoing, Wisageni Studio reserves the right at any time to impose additional terms or conditions on your use of Virtual Items. Such additional terms and conditions will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement. Your continued use of the App will be deemed acceptance thereof. If we need to contact you about your Virtual Items or your account, you consent to receive the notices by email. You acknowledge and agree that any such notices that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements.
The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, except where expressly authorized in the Apps, if any.
Virtual Items have no monetary value and are not currency or property. Virtual Items do not have an equivalent value in real cash and do not act as a substitute for real world money. Virtual Items cannot be sold, traded, transferred, or exchanged for cash. Virtual Items may only be redeemed for certain gameplay entitlements that may be made available within the App from time to time. Neither Wisageni Studio nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Virtual Items for anything of value. Wisageni Studio has no liability for hacking or loss of your Virtual Items.
Price and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.
Unless otherwise required by law, all purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through the App or Services are final and non-refundable, and you are not entitled to a refund for any unused Virtual Items. Once you redeem a Virtual Item for a gameplay entitlement within the App or Services, such gameplay entitlement is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable. You acknowledge and consent that the provision of Virtual Items for use in connection with the App or Services is a process that commences immediately upon purchase and you forfeit your right of withdrawal once the performance has started.
Unless otherwise required by law, you agree that Wisageni Studio is not required to provide a refund for Virtual Items for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items, whether your loss of license under this Agreement was voluntary or involuntary.
If you request your personal data to be erased as specified in Wisageni Studio’s Privacy Policy, you will permanently and without a right to a refund lose all of your Virtual Items as Wisageni Studio can no longer associate such Virtual Items with you.
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT Wisageni Studio IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND TO YOU FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR ANY UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT, YOUR ACCOUNT IS TERMINATED, OR WHEN YOU CEASE TO USE THE APP OR SERVICES.
6.2. Subscriptions
Some of Wisageni Studio’s Apps may offer subscription-based Services. If you purchase a subscription, then by clicking the purchase button you are requesting that we begin supplying the subscription Services immediately and you are entering into a monthly subscription contract with Wisageni Studio. You are also authorizing a charge to you on a recurring basis of a monthly subscription fee at the rate quoted at the time of purchase.  By purchasing a subscription, we will automatically charge on a recurring basis the payment method associated with your account. For subscription Services purchased in a Wisageni Studio App played on a platform such as Apple or Google, the applicable platform will charge you for the subscription fee and the platform’s payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate platform’s payment terms for additional information.
Trial subscriptions are offered free of charge for a certain period of time from activation specified in the relevant trial offer in the App. If you do not cancel the subscription within such trial period, the trial subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription for the fees and for the subscription period set out in the App at the time of the activation of the trial period. You may cancel a subscription during its free trial period using the subscription setting of your account. Any paid subscription you activate begins immediately from the activation of such paid subscription and not after the expiration of any trial period. Any unused trial period will therefore be forfeited if a subscription is activated prior to the expiration of such trial period.
Your subscription will automatically renew each subscription period unless and until you terminate your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews, otherwise payment of the subscription fees for the next period will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing Wisageni Studio with valid credit card or payment account details for payment of all fees. In case the subscription fee cannot be taken from your account due to absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card or for any other reason, your subscription will be automatically cancelled.
Subscription rates are based on an amount in U.S. Dollars. If you are using a local currency, the actual amount may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates without notice to you. The charges will be applied to the payment instrument or method you provide when you start your subscription (or to a different payment instrument or method, if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges are subject to change. If we make a change to the monthly subscription rate in U.S. Dollars, we will notify you of such change in advance.
Once you have purchased a subscription, you cannot cancel your subscription for the current subscription period as that is activated as soon as you purchase a subscription. However, you may cancel your subscription for the next subscription period as follows: you can manage and cancel your subscription at any time in your “Account Settings” of your device.
For iOS subscriptions, please see
Apple’s support page.
For Google Play subscriptions, please see
Google Play’s support page.
Except where required by applicable law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable.
Wisageni Studio in its sole discretion and at any time may modify the subscription fee. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. You will be provided reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fee. If you do not take action to agree to the increase in subscription fee, your subscription shall expire at the end of the then-current subscription period.
7. Apple
If you use the Services on an Apple device, then you agree and acknowledge that:
Apple, Inc. bears no duties or obligations to you under the Terms, including, but not limited to, any obligation to furnish you with maintenance and support with respect to the Services;
You will have no claims, and you waive any and all rights and causes of action against Apple with respect to the Services or the Terms, including, but not limited to claims related to maintenance and support, intellectual property infringement, liability, consumer protection, or regulatory or legal conformance; and
Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of the Terms. Upon your acceptance of the Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
Export Control. You represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

Privacy Shield Notice
1. WHO WE ARE
Vungle is an ad network providing a technology platform (“
Platform
”) for Clients that want to advertise and/or monetize their applications, games, and other products. Our “
Clients
” include “
Advertisers
” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Platform, and “
Publishers
” of applications that want to display relevant ads to end users (“
End Users
“) of third party applications (“
apps
“) that use our SDKs, APIs, hosted video advertising platform and/or any of our related advertising tools (collectively, the “
Vungle Ad Services
“).
Advertising revenue helps keep many games and apps free, and Vungle works hard to ensure that our ads are interesting, relevant, and safe for End Users.
2. VUNGLE AD SERVICES
This Section describes how Vungle collects and uses information we receive from End Users (“
you
“) of apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.
2.1 What information do we collect?
When you use an app supported by Vungle technology (see Section 2.3,
below
, our services can collect certain information about your mobile device. Some of this information (including for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be “personal information” or “personal data” as defined under law in some jurisdictions (including in California and the EU, respectively) (hereinafter, collectively referred to as “
personal information
”). We collect this information the first time Vungle’s SDK is initialized on a Publisher Client’s app. Note, however, that Vungle’s Ad Services do not collect any information that that enables us to identify End Users personally (such as your name, address, or email address).
LEARN MORE
The information we collect includes:
Information about your device
, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address, Vungle SDK version, information about the Publisher Client’s app currently active on your device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer or Publisher Client’s app).
Information about your behavior on our Publisher Client’s app
, such as information about the activities or actions on those apps, and session start/stop time. Historic versions of Vungle technology may also collect geolocation information (e.g., latitude and longitude co-ordinates), but only (i) if the Publisher Client’s app has enabled location services on your device and (ii) you have granted the Publisher permission to collect this information). However, versions that are current as of the date of this Notice no longer collect geolocation information.
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on
, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, the number of times you have seen the ad, the number of Vungle ads viewed per session, and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.
We may also combine and/or enhance the information we collect about your device, including the personal information, with information we may collect about your interactions with other ads served through Vungle’s Platform that you may view on other Publisher Client’s Apps, or with information collected from our Clients and third parties (such as data providers). This may include, for example, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on an app to help make the ads served to you more relevant while limiting your exposure to less relevant ads. We (or our third party partners) may also use this additional information to undertake “user matching,” which means that in addition to the ID an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Clients have assigned to an End User.
2.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information, including the personal information, we collect (sometimes in combination with information provided and sourced by independent validation partners) for a variety of business purposes, including the following:
Serving Ads:
To allow Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their apps, and Advertisers to bid on and display ads in that inventory.
Ad Reporting and Conversions:
: To allow Vungle to confirm with Advertisers information about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website and to ensure accurate billing for advertising services rendered.
Frequency Capping:
Preventing End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.
Customizing Ads:
To customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to you and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting your exposure to less relevant ads).
Performance Analytics and Optimization:
To analyze and optimize ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, implementing end user “whitelists” or “blacklists” (to ensure, in some cases, that certain ads are being viewed by appropriate audiences), as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Fraud Detection and Prevention:
Identifying invalid clicks, installs, or ad queries, and protecting us and our Clients from fraudulent behavior.
Providing and Improving the Vungle Ad Services:
Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to provide, protect, and improve the Vungle Ad Services and to ensure that our technologies function properly.
2.3
How does Vungle use its technology to collect information
?
We use our technology (in some jurisdictions, such as the EU, these may be referred to as “tracking technologies”) to collect information automatically from your device to perform many of the functions described in “
How do we use your information?
” above. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions for opting out in the apps, as described in “
Opt-Out Choices
” below.
LEARN MORE
The standard tracking technologies we use include:
Mobile “SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” (including our own SDKs):
These are blocks of code that are embedded into an app allowing Vungle to collect certain information (as described in “
2.1 What information do we collect?
” above relating to your use of apps using our technology. The embedded code from Vungle’s SDK allows the app to “speak” with Vungle’s Platform for purposes of delivering ads.
Mobile device identifiers:
We also use standard device identifiers, for example the IDFA advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices and the GAID advertising identifier used on Android devices, to monitor and improve the performance of the ads we show you.
Third-Party Ad Measurement URLs/Links:
Additionally, in providing the Vungle Ad Services to our Advertiser Clients, the Vungle ads may include URLs or links from the Advertiser Client’s chosen third-party measurement partner to collect information about your interaction with those ads. The information collected is used for ad delivery, reporting, and billing purposes and may also be used for performance optimization.
“Tags and Pixels”:
These are blocks of code that we and our Clients may use to monitor your interaction with apps using our technology. We may use these to synchronize information that we have collected with information independently collected by our Clients and other third party advertising platforms and advertisers that are interested in providing you with ads.
2.4 Your Opt-Out Choices.
You can opt out of having your information being used by Vungle for performance-based advertising by accessing your mobile device settings and following the most recent published instructions. If you limit ad tracking, you will still see advertisements (even ones sourced from Vungle’s network), but Vungle will no longer be able to use the personal information described above in
Section 2.1
to serve you with more relevant ads. In addition, the advertising identifier (along with any information collected about that identifier) that was previously assigned to you will also be disassociated. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt back in, we will not be able to use any of your past information for advertising purposes, and you will (for all practical purposes) be a new user to our system. For apps using older versions of the Vungle SDK, you may also stop the collection of location information by particular apps that may allow collection of location of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
2.5 How Do We Share Information?
Please see Section 4.1,
below
for information concerning how Vungle shares the information collected.
2.6 Privacy Practices of Vungle Clients.
Vungle is not responsible for the information practices of our Clients or their agents. We require our Clients to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide End Users with notice of the collection of data for advertising purposes as outlined in this Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of apps you visit for information about those apps’ data collection and use practices.
2.7 Minors and Children.
Our Clients are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply with data privacy protection legislation applicable to minors and children, such as the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“

With respect to COPPA specifically, we rely upon our Publisher Clients to confirm whether or not their app is subject to COPPA. As required by COPPA, Vungle will enable a flag in our system when a Client indicates their app is subject to COPPA such that the End User’s device history is disassociated, and the only End User personal information used by the Vungle Ad Services would be persistent identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) to provide “support for internal operations” of the Vungle Ad Services (as permitted by COPPA).
