Photo landscapes
All of photographs, that displayed in Photo Wallpaper are free and taken by independent photographers and enthusiasts.

The sky is cut out to display the current weather instead.
And a depth map is made to reflect aerial perspective and mists where it makes sense.
The photographs are used according to the license terms specified on the web-page of the photo. We always link to this page and the author of the photo is mentioned in the bottom left corner of the window.

After that, the photo will not be distributed via Photo Wallpaper anymore.
