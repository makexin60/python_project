us

, as well as through our third party advertising networks and exchange (together, the “
Websites
”).  It is important to be aware that the Websites each have their own privacy policies which govern which information they do and do not collect and how they handle such information.  Therefore, we recommend that you review the privacy policy on each Website you visit.  EHS is not responsible for information gathered from or about you from any of the Websites.
This Privacy Policy is intended to notify you of our online privacy practices, the type of information that may be collected and stored, how the information is used, with whom the information may be shared, what choices are available to you regarding the collection, use and distribution of the information, what kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control, and who to contact with questions or concerns.
By using or accessing the Services or Websites and/or by contacting us and/or by providing any personal information, you consent to the collection and use of such information by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page.
Why We Collect Information:
We collect personal information in order to provide the Services on and through the Websites and deliver information that you agree to receive from us.
How We Collect Information:
We collect information in three primary ways:
You Give Us Information
: We collect information from you when you submit it to us through the Websites or Services.
We Collect Information Automatically
: We automatically collect certain types of information when you visit or use the Websites or Services, or when you click on banners, advertisements or hyperlinks. For example, we automatically collect various types of technical information, such as the type of web browser you use, the time and date that you accessed the Websites, the pages or advertisements you visited and the amount of time you did so, and your location to the extent available.
We Collect Information from Other Sources
: We may obtain information about you from outside sources.  For example, we may obtain commercially or publicly available information about you from third-parties or purchase email lists from third-parties for advertising and marketing purpose or fraud detection/prevention.   We may also receive information from third-parties who provide services for us through web-beacons and other technologies as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy.
What Information We Collect
:
We may collect, store and use information that can be used to identify you and that may be used to determine your use of the Websites or Services, or how the Websites should be made available to you.  This information includes:
Information about your visits to and use of the Websites or Services;
Information which will determine the country or region within a country from which you are accessing the Websites;
Your browser preferred language; and/or
Information that you provide to us directly or through any of the Websites, directly or indirectly (i.e., provided to us by the Websites as a result of your use thereof) or Services.
In addition, EHS may arrange for other companies to provide some of the Services, including in connection with the placement of advertisements on the Websites.  Such advertisements, and your viewing of such advertisements, is governed by this Privacy Policy and may also be governed by the third party’s Privacy Policy if and when you leave the Websites.
Please do not submit any sensitive personal information or data to us, including but not limited to your: (i) racial or ethnic origin; (ii) political, philosophical or religious beliefs, including membership in a political party or trade union; (iii) physical or mental health, biometric details or genetic makeup; or (iv) sexual orientation or preferences. If any such information is submitted to us, it is at your own risk.
General Browsing
:
Even if you do not submit personal information through the Websites, we may gather navigational information about where visitors go on or through the Websites, what materials or advertisements they “click” or access, and information about the technical efficiencies of our services. This information allows us to provide our services to our clients and customers, as well as help us better understand the overall and individual Website user experience. This information also helps us improve the quality of our services to our clients and customers, as well as those visiting and using the Websites, by recognizing and delivering more of the features, areas, and services the Websites’ users prefer. In this process of gathering information, we may collect personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser type and version, service provider and IP address, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, email address, and click-stream data). We may also create and use electronic records to compile statistics about how our visitors collectively interact with the Websites.  We may also supplement this information with other available public or commercial databases to build out user profiles for improved targeting and to share with our advertisers for their services.
Mobile Browsing:
If you are accessing the Websites via a mobile device, information about your use of the Websites, as well as your mobile device type, carrier and location may be communicated to us, and your information may be shared with your mobile carrier or access provider.
Use of Cookies and Other Tracking:
We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies on the Websites.  Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website may transfer to a visitor’s computer to identify specific information about that visitor’s visits to that website. Session cookies or transient cookies are cookies that are stored in temporary memory and are not retained when the browser is closed. In other words, they are erased when you close your browser. Session cookies do not collect information from your computer and typically will store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify you.  Persistent cookies assign a unique identification to your computer and are typically stored on your computer’s hard drive and are used to help track clicks as you use or access the Websites, or to tell us whether you have previously visited the Websites.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer until affirmatively deleted by you.
We may also use cookies set by third-parties with whom we have entered into agreements which may enable us to obtain analytics information about the use of the Websites.  You can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it.  You may also use commonly available tools in your browser to remove cookies which may have been placed onto your computer.
We may also use FLASH cookies.  FLASH cookies, also known as shared local objects, are cookies that are placed on your computer that are not removed through normal browser management tools.
We may also use traffic analysis software to track the use patterns of users of the Websites, and other technologies such as digital fingerprinting, browser cache, device IDs, or watermarking to identify the user of the Websites.
We may also use web beacons or clear .gifs.  Web beacons or clear .gifs, and similar technologies are pieces of code placed on a web page to collect data on the users of a specific web page.
Server Logs and Widgets:
We may use web server logs.  A web server log is a record of activity created by a computer that delivers certain webpages to your browser.  Certain activities that you perform utilizing the Websites or Services may record information in server logs, such as if you enter a search term into a search box located on the Services.  For example, the server log may record the search term(s) you use, or the link you clicked on to bring you to the Websites.  The server log may also record information about your browser, such as your IP address and the cookies set on your browser.
We may also use widgets.  A widget is generally an application that can be embedded in a webpage, and which can provide real-time information to the webpage.  Widgets are often provided by third-parties to enable collection of data about website usage.
General:
By using or accessing the Services or Websites and/or by contacting us and/or by providing any personal information, you give us your consent to track your activities using the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send you.

Google Product Privacy Guide
How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

Company Practices
The following statement describes the overall company practices of Adprime Media, including advertising on our network of websites, as well as across other internal sites, and products and services that are offered by Adprime Media. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Adprime Media does not own or control, or to people that Adprime Media does not employ.
Information Collected by Adprime Media
The following statement describes the overall company practices of Adprime Media, including advertising on our network of websites, as well as across other internal sites, and products and services that are offered by Adprime Media. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Adprime Media does not own or control, or to people that Adprime Media does not employ.
Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data
Adprime Media delivers advertisements across multiple channels and media, including to web surfers who visit any of the thousands of websites that are a part of Adprime Media's network. With respect to individuals who visit those sites, we, and/or one or more of our third party advertising technology vendors, may collect what is known as "Click Stream Data." Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes information such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web surfer to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels). In addition to the Click Stream Data collected across our web network, Adprime Media owns numerous websites and services, and often runs promotions and sweepstakes offers through various Internet channels (collectively referred to as "Adprime Media Properties"), and collects information at those sites. As a part of the registration process at the Adprime Media Properties, we may request and collect additional non-personally identifiable information about the visitor. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual. Web surfers may elect not to provide Click Stream Data by following the Cookie Opt-Out procedures set forth below. In addition, web surfers who have provided registration data to Adprime Media may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the Data Opt-Out procedures set forth below. Personally identifiable information that is collected at the Adprime Media Properties is discussed immediately below.
Personally Identifiable Consumer Data At some of the Adprime Media Properties, we ask people to register and provide personally identifiable data. Adprime Media is committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all consumers before the personally identifiable data is collected, and that they have opted-in to our use of their data. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, and email address. Web surfers who have provided personally identifiable data may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the Data Opt-Out procedures set forth below. If a Web surfer elects to provide Adprime Media with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes.
Other Information that is Collected
At some Adprime Media Properties, including this one, Adprime Media collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with Adprime Media ("business information"). An example of this would include web publishers who want to become a part of Adprime Media's web network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc. We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.How Collected Information is Used
The non-personally identifiable data that Adprime Media and/or its third party advertising technology vendors collect are used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements to people across the different websites they visit. Adprime Media may also use the non-personally identifiable data to better target content to individuals in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for each person. The data are also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals. If a consumer elects to provide Adprime Media with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to that consumer's preferences and behaviors, and for other Adprime Media sales and marketing efforts.
Sharing With Third Parties
All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in confidence by Adprime Media. There are instances, however, in which personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below. The non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of Adprime Media on an anonymous basis.
With respect to personally identifiable information, Adprime Media may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other services related to providing an Adprime Media product or service. Any third-party vendor so used will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Adprime Media. Adprime Media may also share personally identifiable information with third parties who enter into business relationships with us. These business partners may include financial service providers (including credit bureaus and insurance agents); non-financial companies (including retailers, online and offline advertisers, membership list vendors, direct marketers and publishers); companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, unaffiliated third parties,  and others such as non-profit organizations. We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service signed up for, if we decide to stop providing such services ourselves. In such situations, we will provide our subscribers with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that Adprime Media is very careful about which companies it does business with.
In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that Adprime Media, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. If that's the case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to your information. Finally, Adprime Media may share information on individuals as it deems necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.

Privacy Statement
This digital service participates in the DMD Healthcare Communication Network
SM
(the “Network”), and as such has implemented various technologies for universal registration/login among all Network member websites. These technologies are managed by DMD Marketing Corp. (“DMD”), and may involve the collection, receipt, and sharing of information with DMD, its clients and other Network members.

Security Precautions
Adprime Media makes significant efforts to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. We use various technologies, including, in certain instances, encryption, to ensure the high security standards. Any data that is stored on Adprime Media's servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public. Adprime Media has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist.
Consumer Choice
on-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data - Use of Cookies & Opting-Out
Adprime Media uses technology, including technology from its third party advertising technology vendors, which includes cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels), to deliver better, targeted marketing messages to the web surfer. These tools are used to collect non-personally identifiable data to provide better and more relevant services and messages to that user. We believe that the use of such tools assists in providing a more meaningful web-surfing experience, but you may opt-out of the use of Adprime Media cookies and those of our third party advertising technology vendors if you would like. To do so, you can disable cookies on your browser. Alternatively, you can opt-out of Adprime Media's cookies by going to the opt-out section at this site, and you may opt-out of our third party advertising technology vendors' cookies by going to the "Third Party Advertising Technology Vendors" Section, above, and linking on a specific vendor's name. (For more information on cookies and web beacons, please refer to the FAQ section).
Access to Data
Adprime Media allows consumers who have voluntarily provided personally identifiable data access to their data to ensure that it is correct and to make any changes. Please contact us.
Miscellaneous
Children's Privacy
Adprime Media is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy. Adprime Media's websites, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children.

Privacy Policy: Opting-out
Data Opt-Out
If a consumer elects to provide Adprime Media with personally identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such data described in the Adprime Media Privacy Policy, or may have such data deleted in its entirety. Simply contact us and provide the name of the service for which you provided information and let us know what level of opt-out you would like to exercise. These include: (1) Do not share information about me with business partners, (2) Do not solicit me with special offers other than those related to the service I signed up for, (3) Remove my data from your database for such service completely. Once we receive this instruction, we will promptly take corrective action. Please note that we will need you to provide your email address or other previously provided personal identifier in order to identify you in the Data Opt-Out process. Also, please remember that if you choose to delete your information completely you will no longer receive the Adprime Media service in question.
Cookie Opt-Out
The use of "cookie" files has become an industry standard for many, if not most, of the thousands of companies doing business on the Internet. Like these other companies, Adprime Media and its third party advertising technology vendor also use cookies in an effort to provide a more meaningful web-surfing experience to Internet users. Cookies are text files that are placed by a client server onto the browser of a visitor to a website. These files are harmless to your computer, and can store navigation information as you move throughout the website. The cookie information can only be read by the server that authored the cookie, and provides no personally identifiable information about the individual who is using the computer (only the computer used to access the Web through what is known as the IP address). Cookies perform many important and useful functions: they help website owners determine which sections of their sites are more appealing to their visitors; they help speed the web experience by eliminating the need to enter user names and passwords constantly; they make it possible to provide personalized pages for the visitor; they help advertisers avoid repeatedly serving the same ads to the same visitor; and they help advertisers learn which advertisements are of interest to visitors. Adprime Media and its third party advertising technology vendor use cookie files to collect anonymous web-surfing information, known as Click Stream Data, on web surfers who visit websites in our web network, and who respond to advertisements that we show. None of the Click Stream Data is personally identifiable. Collecting the Click Stream Data assists us in delivering targeted and more relevant advertising messages to web surfers. As you can tell from above, cookies serve many useful purposes for the Internet community. Nevertheless, Adprime Media firmly believes that every individual who uses the Internet should be able to make informed decisions with respect to individual privacy matters, including the use of cookies. One way to prevent the use of cookies is through adjusting the preferences on your Internet browser. Most browsers permit you to remove cookies that have been previously stored, as well as prevent the future use of cookies.
Opting-Out
Adprime Media, or data providers we have engaged, use cookies to enable you to receive customized ads, content or services, and to provide Adprime Media with certain information. No PII is placed into these cookies. The cookies may reflect demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, i.e., your e-mail address in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies, please visit
http://optout.aboutads.info
Are There Any Drawbacks to Opting-Out?
Adprime Media believes that providing targeted and relevant content to Internet users enhances the web-surfing experience. If you decide to opt-out, it will affect our ability to provide you with such advertising content, and will prevent us from controlling the frequency with which you may view particular advertisements.

This privacy notice (“Notice”) will inform you about the types of personal, behavioral, and other information that the Healthcare Communications Network (“Network,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and discloses about you from our Network member websites, as well as any information that we process through our own website, which is available at: https://hcn.health/.
Each website maintained by the members of the Network will have its own privacy policy that applies. You should review any additional privacy policies to understand how they affect any information that you provide or is collected at that website. The Network itself, and IQVIA Inc. (“IQVIA”) in particular, are not responsible for the policies or actions of individual Network members regarding the information you provide to them or how they use it.
The Information We Collect
We may collect information that can be used to identify you, and other personal information you voluntarily submit, as part of a registration process at a Network member’s website. We may combine the personal information we collect about you with other personal information about you that we obtain from public or private sources. We may also collect information as a result of your interaction with any Network member’s website, an IQVIA client (“Client”) website, any website where relevant advertising might occur, or any communication received directly or indirectly from us. This means we may collect information from you, and about you, through multiple locations, not just the website through which you initially register.
The information we may collect automatically, on or through, Network member websites, or Client websites, includes your Internet protocol (IP) address, user agent strings, mobile device identification number, geolocation data, browser type, page access history, linking information, click stream data, page visits, page views, and/or website log files. If we identify that you are accessing Network or Client websites through multiple devices, we will associate each such device with your profile.
We may use cookies, pixels, web tags, beacons, or similar technological devices to identify users and/or their computer(s) or mobile device(s) in order to keep track of users’ interactions with Network member websites, Client websites, and communications with us.
We may share any of the categories of data we collect for our business and commercial purposes (as elaborated on in the “How We Use Your Information” and “How We Disclose Your Information” sections below).
How We Use Your Information
We may use the information we collect from you in the following ways:
To identify and verify your professional medical status by checking your information against the information listed on available databases, including those made available by the American Medical Association, the NPPES NPI Registry, and/or state licensing boards.
To analyze data at an aggregate and/or individual level to personalize and enhance your experience while interacting with Network member, Client websites, and across the various communication channels you use to receive professionally relevant information.
To identity individuals who visit a website or group of websites where relevant advertising might occur. Personal information, such as the email address, of an individual or group of individuals who meet targeting criteria might be shared with Network members or Clients so that relevant advertising or marketing communications can be delivered. In certain cases, such as social media websites, a proprietary file from the website that identifies these individuals might be shared with Network members or Clients so that relevant advertising or marketing communication can be delivered.
To allow us or our Clients to deliver the type of content and services that we believe may be of interest to you as a health care professional.  Such content might be delivered to you as an email, an advertisement on a website, a promotional item on a social media platform (a sponsored post, advertisement, etc.), an advertisement delivered via a connected television platform or other connected device. Such content will be targeted to your professional experience and/or interests, based on your professional activities and/or other information we have collected or otherwise able to access.
To monitor usage and interaction statistics on Network member, Client websites, and/or through responses to communications.
To establish your online account and authenticate you during login at any website that provides medically relevant information.
To share your engagement information with the sponsor(s) of the medically relevant programs with which you interact.
To determine your geographical location in order to exclude non-U.S. participants.
To offer you our services through our website.
For analytics and interest-based advertisements (as described below in the “How We Disclose Your Information” section).
How We Protect Your Information
We have established and implemented reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative procedures designed to safeguard and secure the personal information we collect and maintain online. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee the security of information that is transmitted over the Internet or stored on our servers.   Any information you provide to us, whether directly, or through a Network member or Client website, is at your own risk.
Please note that we do not have any control over, or responsibility for, information you provide to or through Network member, or Client websites.  Those websites are not managed by the Network. Any concern you may have regarding how a particular Network member or Client website protects personal information should be directed to that specific Network member or Client.
How We Disclose Your Information
We may disclose your information to third parties in the following circumstances:
Verification.
Although all Network and Client communications are designed to be professionally relevant to health care professionals, certain information, products, and services we provide only to specific types of medical professionals. To ensure that we are delivering the information, products, and services as may be required by law, guidelines (e.g., Certified Medical Education and PDMA) or contract, we may share your information with third-party sources to verify your eligibility to receive the content.
Network Members.
The Network exists to allow members to share relevant information, including visitor’s personal information, with one another. We may disclose your personal information to any/all members of the Network for their own purposes and subject to their individual privacy policies.
