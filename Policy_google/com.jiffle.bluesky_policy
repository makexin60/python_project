Are you a Customer, Customer Data Subject or Visitor?
This policy applies to the following classification of individuals that interact with Cvent:
CUSTOMERS
: Customers are individuals that are employees or associates of Cvent’s direct customers (for example, event planners, travel buyers and meeting space providers), including customer personnel that are assigned a login ID and are authorized to access and use our Applications pursuant to an active Cvent agreement, or under a temporary evaluation license, if available. Additionally, Customers include individuals who self-register to access our Applications.
CUSTOMER DATA SUBJECT
: Customer Data Subjects are individuals that interact with our Customers through our Applications. These include our Customers’ current and prospective clients, members, attendees, sponsors, exhibitors, marketing partners, hotel guests or other business contacts. For example, Customer Data Subjects include individuals that register for an event organized by a Customer, download an event-related mobile app, participate in a virtual event organized by a Customer, complete an online survey, or make a hotel or meeting space reservation using one of Cvent's Applications.
VISITORS
: Individuals and prospective customers who interact with our Websites (for instance, to access our Supplier Network without registration (as a non-Customer), to read about Cvent products and services, download a white paper, or sign up for an online demo); those who attend Cvent marketing events (for instance, Cvent CONNECT
®,
Cvent live events and webinars); those who we meet at a tradeshow; or those who we learn about from third parties or other external sources.
Cvent’s direct customers are organizations and businesses that use our Applications to process personal data about their Customer Data Subjects. Cvent processes personal data about Customer Data Subjects in our Applications as a “data processor” or “service provider” only according to our Customers’ instructions.  If you are a Customer Data Subject and have questions about how a Cvent Customer uses your data or want to exercise your rights regarding your personal data, you should direct your request or inquiry to the Cvent Customer that controls your data.  For example, if you have attended an event hosted by a Cvent Customer, you should direct your data rights requests to the host of your event.
What types of personal data do our Customers collect?
Our Applications are flexible and allow our Customers to collect a variety of personal data from and about their Customer Data Subjects, including name, organization, title, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, social media account ID, credit or debit card number and other information including but not limited to meal preferences, interests, opinions, activities, and occupation. We encourage Customer Data Subjects to review the Customers’ privacy policies to further understand the types of data collected.
For a more detailed list of our Applications, please refer to the section titled “
What are Cvent's products covered by this policy?”
. Cvent’s use of personal information collected through our Applications shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our Customers have engaged Cvent, to improve our services, or as required or permitted by law.
If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you may choose not to use our Applications.
How do our Customers collect personal data?
Customers can use our customizable Applications to collect personal data in a variety of ways as outlined in the examples below.
When Customer Data Subjects voluntarily and explicitly enter personal data into our Applications.
When our Customers enter Customer Data Subjects into our Applications, when permitted, including by having a legitimate business interest or obtaining consent from a Customer Data Subject.
Automatically, as Customer Data Subjects interact with our Applications, using commonly used information gathering technologies such as cookies. For additional information about these technologies, see the section below titled  “
How does Cvent use cookies and similar technologies?
How do our Customers use personal data?
If a Customer Data Subject chooses to use our Applications to conduct business with a Customer (for example: to register for or check into an event, respond to an online survey, download a mobile application, make a room reservation, or send or respond to a Request for Proposal (“RFP”)), any information provided in connection with that interaction will be transferred to, and under the control of, the Customer.
Customers will also have access to information (including personal data and Application usage data) related to how Customer Data Subject interact with the Applications they use. In such instances, the Customers are the data controllers of the Customer Data Subject’s personal data, under the European Economic Area (“EEA”) data protection laws.  Therefore, Cvent cannot and does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of Customers.
The information practices of our Customers are governed by their privacy policies. We encourage Customer Data Subjects to review the Customers’ privacy policies to understand their practices and procedures.
Does Cvent use or sell personal data collected by our Customers?
As a service provider, Cvent does not use personal data of our Customer Data Subjects for any purposes other than to provide services that our Customers have contracted us to provide through our Applications, as noted below, to improve our services, or as required or permitted by law. Cvent does not sell personal data of our Customer Data Subjects for monetary or other consideration.  Furthermore, Cvent does not share Customer Data Subject personal data with any third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration.
How does Cvent collect and process personal data from our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects?
We collect personal data from our Customers in order to facilitate communication and delivery of the Applications that our Customers are interested in or contract us to provide. For example, we may collect Customer contact information, whether through the execution of a contract, use of our services, a form on our Website, queries submitted to our chat agent, an interaction with our sales or customer support team, sign up for an event, or a response to one of our surveys or marketing emails. We may also collect credit card information (e.g., credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) or other customary bank information needed for billing and payment purposes.
We may record and store Customer and Visitor support chats, messages, phone calls, video calls, teleconferences and web conferences (including audio and video content) for legitimate business interests related to providing Customer support, compliance with laws, training and coaching, process improvement, and quality assurance.  We may analyze the content of our support communications using data analytics tools to gain better insights into our interactions with customers. We will always notify you before a call will be recorded and will obtain consent from you where required by law.
We and our vendors collect Customer usage information about how our Customers interact with our Applications. This includes which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you perform certain actions, what language preference you have, what you buy, and so on.
We process Customer’s and their Customer Data Subjects’ personal data in the following manner:
To disclose to our subsidiaries and affiliates for the purpose of providing services to our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects.
To disclose to contractors, service providers, and other third parties as reasonably necessary or prudent to provide, maintain and support our Applications for our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects, such as, for example, payment processors and data center or Web hosting providers.
To deliver the services that our Customer has contracted us to provide through our Applications. Some examples include:
If a Customer Data Subject uses one of our Applications to register for an event, we will use their provided e-mail address to send them information and announcements relating to that event.
If a Customer Data Subject uses one of our Applications to pay for event registration fees or other products and services using their credit cards, we will pass the credit card information to payment card processors to validate the payment information and complete the transactions.
When a Customer submits an RFP to a meeting space provider listed on the Cvent Supplier Network, or to a Customer's Business Contact as directed by the Customer, Cvent will contact that venue, management company or Customer Data Subject and disclose information, which contains personal data, necessary for it to respond to the RFP.
When a Customer reserves a meeting space or hotel room at a venue utilizing Cvent’s InstantBook service, Cvent will share necessary personal data with the venue directly or via that venue’s technology platform, in order to complete the booking directly with Customer.
When a Customer or Customer Data Subject uses their social media credentials to share information on their social media platform or to log into one of our Applications, we will share information with their social media account provider. The information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.
To disclose to event organizers, exhibitors, or other attendees, as directed by a Customer or consented to by a Customer Data Subject, such as by consenting to having an exhibitor scan their event badge to share their contact information, opting-in or clicking to give consent to receive exhibitor information, or actively consenting to share information in a Cvent Application (e.g., name, contact information, profile picture, survey responses, Q&A features, comments, messages, poll responses, etc.).
As instructed by Customer, to connect Customer Data Subjects with one another by relying on matching algorithms to recommend compatible Customer Data Subjects for optional business networking.
To deliver to a third party in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, recapitalization, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all Cvent’s assets, whether as a continuing operating business or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal data held by Cvent about our Customers and Customer Data Subjects is among the assets transferred.
For our internal business purposes that include administering access and use of our Applications, data analysis, securely identifying Customers upon logging onto an Application, enhancing or modifying our Applications, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, billing for Services, and operating our business.
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; and (c) to protect against or identify fraudulent transactions.
For other purposes when Customer Data Subjects provide consent.
We aggregate information about (i) Customers and Customer Data Subjects, and (ii) the use of our Applications in order to improve our Applications and to create benchmark and other business intelligence products. None of the aggregated information contain personal data (i.e., does not identify any individual).
Where permitted, we may use Customer personal information collected from and about the Customer to deliver tailored advertising and marketing to the Customer: (i) on our Applications, (ii) on third-party sites and mobile apps not affiliated with Cvent, and (iii) through direct marketing (for example: e-mail, mail, SMS, phone), for ourselves and for Cvent Customers. Customers may change their communications preferences with Cvent via the subscription management form provided under: “
How Can a Customer or Visitor Manage their Cvent Email preferences?
”  If a Customer wishes to have their information excluded from this type of use, click
here
to submit the request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information and see section titled “
How to Manage and Control Cookies and Similar Technologies
”.
What is the legal basis for Cvent to process personal data?
For individuals that are from the European Economic Area (EEA) or other regions that stipulate a lawful basis for processing personal information (such as under GDPR Article 6), our legal basis for collecting and using their personal information will depend on the nature and circumstances of the processing activity. Where we are the processor for our Customers, our legal basis may be fulfilment of a contract or consent. Where we are the controller, our legal basis will be consent or legitimate interest where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by the individual’s data protection interests, or fundamental rights and freedoms. These interests are to provide individuals with access to the Applications and features of the Applications; to send them information they have requested; to ensure the security of our Applications by trying to prevent unauthorised or malicious activities; or to enforce compliance with our terms of use, contracts and other policies.
How long does Cvent store personal data collected by our Customers?
Unless otherwise provided in our contract with our Customer, we process the data until 90 days after the termination of the contract, at which time we remove it from our production environment. Within 13 months, we remove the data from our backup media.
How can a Customer Data Subject access, correct or delete their personal data?
Depending on their jurisdiction,
Customer Data Subjects have the right to request access to
their personal data and, if necessary, have it amended, deleted or restricted. Customer Data Subjects can also ask for some types of personal data to be delivered to them, or another organization they nominate, in a structured and machine-readable format.
Where we process your personal data on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. See the Cvent contact section below. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Customer Data Subjects in the EEA also have the right to complain to a supervisory authority for data protection in the country where they live, or where they work – although we hope that we can assist with any queries or concerns you have about our use of your personal data.
Cvent processes Customer Data Subjects' data under the direction of our Customers and has no direct control or ownership of the personal data we process. Customers are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws requiring notice, disclosure or obtaining consent prior to transferring the data to Cvent for processing purposes. Any Customer Data Subject that seeks to access, correct or delete data, should direct their query to the Customer. If the Customer requests Cvent to delete, rectify or access the personal data of a Customer Data Subject to comply with data protection regulations, Cvent will process this request within the required time under the applicable regulation or law.
We will not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In such instances, we will inform the Customer about the legal obligations that prevent us from fulfilling the request.
How can a Customer access, correct, or delete their personal data?
Customers have the same rights to access, correct or delete their personal data as outlined above.
Any Customer can access, correct or delete their data, or their Customer Data Subject data by submitting a request on our Website at
https://www.cvent.com/personal-data-requests

We will maintain an audit history of any requests to access, correct or delete personal information to maintain a record of compliance with regulatory requirements.

How does Cvent use cookies and similar technologies?
Cookies and Web Beacons
We and authorized third parties use cookies or similar automatic data collection technologies as individuals interact with our Website or our Applications to collect certain information about their equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including d
etails of your visits to our Applications, such as the date and time you access our Applications, length of time you spend on our Applications, websites that linked to our Applications or websites linked from our Applications, the resources and content that you access and use on the Applications; i
nformation about your computer and internet connection, such as your IP Address, computer type, screen resolution, language, Internet browser type and version. We do not use any of these technologies to collect information from Customer Data Subjects for marketing or advertising purposes.  Our Customers may add cookies or other similar technologies through our Applications for their own purposes, including for marketing purposes.
Browser Cookies.
A cookie is a small file placed on a computer hard drive.  Web browsers can be configured to restrict or entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device.  Information on how to do this is provided by the web browser’s help/reference section. Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may prevent a Customer or Customer Data Subject from using certain portions of our Applications, depending on how the browser settings are configured.  For example, event registration cannot be completed successfully if cookies are disabled in the web browser. Unless the browser setting has been adjusted so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when the browser interacts with our Applications.
Purpose.
Our Website and Applications use cookies that serve the following purpose types:
Strictly necessary (essential)
. Strictly necessary cookies make our Website work, they are essential for the Website to perform its basic functions.
Performance
.  Also known as “statistics cookies”, and including analytics cookies, performance cookies collect information about how you use a website, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked on. None of this information can be used to identify you. Their sole purpose is to improve website functions. This includes cookies from third-party analytics services as long as the cookies are for the exclusive use of the owner of the website visited.
Functionality
.  Also known as “preferences” cookies, these cookies allow a website to remember choices you have made in the past, like what language you prefer.  They are used to enhance the user experience of the website but are non-essential to their use, but without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
Marketing
.  These cookies track your online activity to help advertisers deliver more relevant advertising or to limit how many times you see an ad. These cookies can share that information with other organizations or advertisers. These are persistent cookies and almost always of third-party provenance.
Web Beacons.
Pages in our Applications and emails
will
contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs).  Web beacons differ from cookies in that the information is not stored on your hard drive, but invisibly embedded on web pages or in email.  Web beacons permit us to track online movements of web users, for example: to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).  This enables Cvent to provide a website experience more tailored to our users’ preferences and interests.
More about Marketing Cookies.
We use information collected from our venue sourcing Customers to enable us to display advertisements from our Hospitality Cloud Customers to their target audience of users through our network or our advertising service providers.  As one example, meeting space providers purchase advertisements that are presented selectively through the Cvent Supplier Network to meeting planners who have previously awarded a minimum volume of meetings business to that provider or to competing venues in the target metropolitan area.  Even though we do not disclose personal data for these purposes, if the venue sourcing user clicks on or otherwise interacts with an advertisement, the advertising Hospitality Cloud Customer assumes that the venue sourcing user meets its target criteria. While we and our Hospitality Cloud Customers leverage this technology to advertise to Customers, we never use our Customer's information to advertise to Customer Data Subjects.  We also use third parties (such as LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, YouTube) to serve advertisements that may be of interest to you on other websites.
More about Performance Cookies.
We use third party analytics providers, including Google, Adobe, Mixpanel, Mouseflow and others, to collect information about the usage of our Applications and Websites to enable us to improve how they work.  The information allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Applications, helps us record any difficulties you have with the Applications, shows us whether our advertising is effective or not, and allows us to use responses to advertisements to optimize ad performance.  Google Analytics, Adobe and Mixpanel use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information about the usage of our Applications and to report website trends to us, without storing any personal data on external third-party analytics provider platforms.
How to Manage and Control Cookies and Similar Technologies
Cookie Controls:

You can manage your preferences through the Cookies Setting link on the website you are visiting.
Do Not Track:
Some browsers include a “Do Not Track” (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.  We do not respond to browser ‘do not track’ signals, as we await for a uniform standard put forth by regulators or the privacy industry.
Global Privacy Control:
Some browsers and browser extensions support the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, including data sales. If your browser supports it, you can turn on the Global Privacy Control to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information.

Are you a Customer, Customer Data Subject or Visitor?
This policy applies to the following classification of individuals that interact with Cvent:
CUSTOMERS
: Customers are individuals that are employees or associates of Cvent’s direct customers (for example, event planners, travel buyers and meeting space providers), including customer personnel that are assigned a login ID and are authorized to access and use our Applications pursuant to an active Cvent agreement, or under a temporary evaluation license, if available. Additionally, Customers include individuals who self-register to access our Applications.
CUSTOMER DATA SUBJECT
: Customer Data Subjects are individuals that interact with our Customers through our Applications. These include our Customers’ current and prospective clients, members, attendees, sponsors, exhibitors, marketing partners, hotel guests or other business contacts. For example, Customer Data Subjects include individuals that register for an event organized by a Customer, download an event-related mobile app, participate in a virtual event organized by a Customer, complete an online survey, or make a hotel or meeting space reservation using one of Cvent's Applications.
VISITORS
: Individuals and prospective customers who interact with our Websites (for instance, to access our Supplier Network without registration (as a non-Customer), to read about Cvent products and services, download a white paper, or sign up for an online demo); those who attend Cvent marketing events (for instance, Cvent CONNECT
®,
Cvent live events and webinars); those who we meet at a tradeshow; or those who we learn about from third parties or other external sources.
Cvent’s direct customers are organizations and businesses that use our Applications to process personal data about their Customer Data Subjects. Cvent processes personal data about Customer Data Subjects in our Applications as a “data processor” or “service provider” only according to our Customers’ instructions.  If you are a Customer Data Subject and have questions about how a Cvent Customer uses your data or want to exercise your rights regarding your personal data, you should direct your request or inquiry to the Cvent Customer that controls your data.  For example, if you have attended an event hosted by a Cvent Customer, you should direct your data rights requests to the host of your event.
What types of personal data do our Customers collect?
Our Applications are flexible and allow our Customers to collect a variety of personal data from and about their Customer Data Subjects, including name, organization, title, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, social media account ID, credit or debit card number and other information including but not limited to meal preferences, interests, opinions, activities, and occupation. We encourage Customer Data Subjects to review the Customers’ privacy policies to further understand the types of data collected.
For a more detailed list of our Applications, please refer to the section titled “
What are Cvent's products covered by this policy?”
. Cvent’s use of personal information collected through our Applications shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our Customers have engaged Cvent, to improve our services, or as required or permitted by law.
If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you may choose not to use our Applications.
How do our Customers collect personal data?
Customers can use our customizable Applications to collect personal data in a variety of ways as outlined in the examples below.
When Customer Data Subjects voluntarily and explicitly enter personal data into our Applications.
When our Customers enter Customer Data Subjects into our Applications, when permitted, including by having a legitimate business interest or obtaining consent from a Customer Data Subject.
Automatically, as Customer Data Subjects interact with our Applications, using commonly used information gathering technologies such as cookies. For additional information about these technologies, see the section below titled  “
How does Cvent use cookies and similar technologies?
How do our Customers use personal data?
If a Customer Data Subject chooses to use our Applications to conduct business with a Customer (for example: to register for or check into an event, respond to an online survey, download a mobile application, make a room reservation, or send or respond to a Request for Proposal (“RFP”)), any information provided in connection with that interaction will be transferred to, and under the control of, the Customer.
Customers will also have access to information (including personal data and Application usage data) related to how Customer Data Subject interact with the Applications they use. In such instances, the Customers are the data controllers of the Customer Data Subject’s personal data, under the European Economic Area (“EEA”) data protection laws.  Therefore, Cvent cannot and does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of Customers.
The information practices of our Customers are governed by their privacy policies. We encourage Customer Data Subjects to review the Customers’ privacy policies to understand their practices and procedures.
Does Cvent use or sell personal data collected by our Customers?
As a service provider, Cvent does not use personal data of our Customer Data Subjects for any purposes other than to provide services that our Customers have contracted us to provide through our Applications, as noted below, to improve our services, or as required or permitted by law. Cvent does not sell personal data of our Customer Data Subjects for monetary or other consideration.  Furthermore, Cvent does not share Customer Data Subject personal data with any third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration.
How does Cvent collect and process personal data from our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects?
We collect personal data from our Customers in order to facilitate communication and delivery of the Applications that our Customers are interested in or contract us to provide. For example, we may collect Customer contact information, whether through the execution of a contract, use of our services, a form on our Website, queries submitted to our chat agent, an interaction with our sales or customer support team, sign up for an event, or a response to one of our surveys or marketing emails. We may also collect credit card information (e.g., credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) or other customary bank information needed for billing and payment purposes.
We may record and store Customer and Visitor support chats, messages, phone calls, video calls, teleconferences and web conferences (including audio and video content) for legitimate business interests related to providing Customer support, compliance with laws, training and coaching, process improvement, and quality assurance.  We may analyze the content of our support communications using data analytics tools to gain better insights into our interactions with customers. We will always notify you before a call will be recorded and will obtain consent from you where required by law.
We and our vendors collect Customer usage information about how our Customers interact with our Applications. This includes which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you perform certain actions, what language preference you have, what you buy, and so on.
We process Customer’s and their Customer Data Subjects’ personal data in the following manner:
To disclose to our subsidiaries and affiliates for the purpose of providing services to our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects.
To disclose to contractors, service providers, and other third parties as reasonably necessary or prudent to provide, maintain and support our Applications for our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects, such as, for example, payment processors and data center or Web hosting providers.
To deliver the services that our Customer has contracted us to provide through our Applications. Some examples include:
If a Customer Data Subject uses one of our Applications to register for an event, we will use their provided e-mail address to send them information and announcements relating to that event.
If a Customer Data Subject uses one of our Applications to pay for event registration fees or other products and services using their credit cards, we will pass the credit card information to payment card processors to validate the payment information and complete the transactions.
When a Customer submits an RFP to a meeting space provider listed on the Cvent Supplier Network, or to a Customer's Business Contact as directed by the Customer, Cvent will contact that venue, management company or Customer Data Subject and disclose information, which contains personal data, necessary for it to respond to the RFP.
When a Customer reserves a meeting space or hotel room at a venue utilizing Cvent’s InstantBook service, Cvent will share necessary personal data with the venue directly or via that venue’s technology platform, in order to complete the booking directly with Customer.
When a Customer or Customer Data Subject uses their social media credentials to share information on their social media platform or to log into one of our Applications, we will share information with their social media account provider. The information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.
To disclose to event organizers, exhibitors, or other attendees, as directed by a Customer or consented to by a Customer Data Subject, such as by consenting to having an exhibitor scan their event badge to share their contact information, opting-in or clicking to give consent to receive exhibitor information, or actively consenting to share information in a Cvent Application (e.g., name, contact information, profile picture, survey responses, Q&A features, comments, messages, poll responses, etc.).
As instructed by Customer, to connect Customer Data Subjects with one another by relying on matching algorithms to recommend compatible Customer Data Subjects for optional business networking.
To deliver to a third party in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, recapitalization, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all Cvent’s assets, whether as a continuing operating business or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal data held by Cvent about our Customers and Customer Data Subjects is among the assets transferred.
For our internal business purposes that include administering access and use of our Applications, data analysis, securely identifying Customers upon logging onto an Application, enhancing or modifying our Applications, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, billing for Services, and operating our business.
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; and (c) to protect against or identify fraudulent transactions.

Where permitted, we may use Customer personal information collected from and about the Customer to deliver tailored advertising and marketing to the Customer: (i) on our Applications, (ii) on third-party sites and mobile apps not affiliated with Cvent, and (iii) through direct marketing (for example: e-mail, mail, SMS, phone), for ourselves and for Cvent Customers. Customers may change their communications preferences with Cvent via the subscription management form provided under: “
How Can a Customer or Visitor Manage their Cvent Email preferences?
”  If a Customer wishes to have their information excluded from this type of use, click
here
to submit the request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information and see section titled “
How to Manage and Control Cookies and Similar Technologies
”.
What is the legal basis for Cvent to process personal data?
For individuals that are from the European Economic Area (EEA) or other regions that stipulate a lawful basis for processing personal information (such as under GDPR Article 6), our legal basis for collecting and using their personal information will depend on the nature and circumstances of the processing activity. Where we are the processor for our Customers, our legal basis may be fulfilment of a contract or consent. Where we are the controller, our legal basis will be consent or legitimate interest where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by the individual’s data protection interests, or fundamental rights and freedoms. These interests are to provide individuals with access to the Applications and features of the Applications; to send them information they have requested; to ensure the security of our Applications by trying to prevent unauthorised or malicious activities; or to enforce compliance with our terms of use, contracts and other policies.
How long does Cvent store personal data collected by our Customers?
Unless otherwise provided in our contract with our Customer, we process the data until 90 days after the termination of the contract, at which time we remove it from our production environment. Within 13 months, we remove the data from our backup media.
How can a Customer Data Subject access, correct or delete their personal data?
Depending on their jurisdiction,
Customer Data Subjects have the right to request access to
their personal data and, if necessary, have it amended, deleted or restricted. Customer Data Subjects can also ask for some types of personal data to be delivered to them, or another organization they nominate, in a structured and machine-readable format.
Where we process your personal data on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. See the Cvent contact section below. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Customer Data Subjects in the EEA also have the right to complain to a supervisory authority for data protection in the country where they live, or where they work – although we hope that we can assist with any queries or concerns you have about our use of your personal data.
Cvent processes Customer Data Subjects' data under the direction of our Customers and has no direct control or ownership of the personal data we process. Customers are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws requiring notice, disclosure or obtaining consent prior to transferring the data to Cvent for processing purposes. Any Customer Data Subject that seeks to access, correct or delete data, should direct their query to the Customer. If the Customer requests Cvent to delete, rectify or access the personal data of a Customer Data Subject to comply with data protection regulations, Cvent will process this request within the required time under the applicable regulation or law.
We will not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In such instances, we will inform the Customer about the legal obligations that prevent us from fulfilling the request.
How can a Customer access, correct, or delete their personal data?
Customers have the same rights to access, correct or delete their personal data as outlined above.
Any Customer can access, correct or delete their data, or their Customer Data Subject data by submitting a request on our Website at

How does Cvent use cookies and similar technologies?
Cookies and Web Beacons
We and authorized third parties use cookies or similar automatic data collection technologies as individuals interact with our Website or our Applications to collect certain information about their equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including d
etails of your visits to our Applications, such as the date and time you access our Applications, length of time you spend on our Applications, websites that linked to our Applications or websites linked from our Applications, the resources and content that you access and use on the Applications; i
nformation about your computer and internet connection, such as your IP Address, computer type, screen resolution, language, Internet browser type and version. We do not use any of these technologies to collect information from Customer Data Subjects for marketing or advertising purposes.  Our Customers may add cookies or other similar technologies through our Applications for their own purposes, including for marketing purposes.
Browser Cookies.
A cookie is a small file placed on a computer hard drive.  Web browsers can be configured to restrict or entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device.  Information on how to do this is provided by the web browser’s help/reference section. Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may prevent a Customer or Customer Data Subject from using certain portions of our Applications, depending on how the browser settings are configured.  For example, event registration cannot be completed successfully if cookies are disabled in the web browser. Unless the browser setting has been adjusted so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when the browser interacts with our Applications.
Purpose.
Our Website and Applications use cookies that serve the following purpose types:
Strictly necessary (essential)
. Strictly necessary cookies make our Website work, they are essential for the Website to perform its basic functions.
Performance
.  Also known as “statistics cookies”, and including analytics cookies, performance cookies collect information about how you use a website, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked on. None of this information can be used to identify you. Their sole purpose is to improve website functions. This includes cookies from third-party analytics services as long as the cookies are for the exclusive use of the owner of the website visited.
Functionality
.  Also known as “preferences” cookies, these cookies allow a website to remember choices you have made in the past, like what language you prefer.  They are used to enhance the user experience of the website but are non-essential to their use, but without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
Marketing
.  These cookies track your online activity to help advertisers deliver more relevant advertising or to limit how many times you see an ad. These cookies can share that information with other organizations or advertisers. These are persistent cookies and almost always of third-party provenance.
Web Beacons.
Pages in our Applications and emails
will
contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs).  Web beacons differ from cookies in that the information is not stored on your hard drive, but invisibly embedded on web pages or in email.  Web beacons permit us to track online movements of web users, for example: to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).  This enables Cvent to provide a website experience more tailored to our users’ preferences and interests.
More about Marketing Cookies.
We use information collected from our venue sourcing Customers to enable us to display advertisements from our Hospitality Cloud Customers to their target audience of users through our network or our advertising service providers.  As one example, meeting space providers purchase advertisements that are presented selectively through the Cvent Supplier Network to meeting planners who have previously awarded a minimum volume of meetings business to that provider or to competing venues in the target metropolitan area.  Even though we do not disclose personal data for these purposes, if the venue sourcing user clicks on or otherwise interacts with an advertisement, the advertising Hospitality Cloud Customer assumes that the venue sourcing user meets its target criteria. While we and our Hospitality Cloud Customers leverage this technology to advertise to Customers, we never use our Customer's information to advertise to Customer Data Subjects.  We also use third parties (such as LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, YouTube) to serve advertisements that may be of interest to you on other websites.
More about Performance Cookies.
We use third party analytics providers, including Google, Adobe, Mixpanel, Mouseflow and others, to collect information about the usage of our Applications and Websites to enable us to improve how they work.  The information allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Applications, helps us record any difficulties you have with the Applications, shows us whether our advertising is effective or not, and allows us to use responses to advertisements to optimize ad performance.  Google Analytics, Adobe and Mixpanel use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information about the usage of our Applications and to report website trends to us, without storing any personal data on external third-party analytics provider platforms.
How to Manage and Control Cookies and Similar Technologies

Global Privacy Control:
Some browsers and browser extensions support the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, including data sales. If your browser supports it, you can turn on the Global Privacy Control to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information.

Are you a Customer, Customer Data Subject or Visitor?
This policy applies to the following classification of individuals that interact with Cvent:
CUSTOMERS
: Customers are individuals that are employees or associates of Cvent’s direct customers (for example, event planners, travel buyers and meeting space providers), including customer personnel that are assigned a login ID and are authorized to access and use our Applications pursuant to an active Cvent agreement, or under a temporary evaluation license, if available. Additionally, Customers include individuals who self-register to access our Applications.
CUSTOMER DATA SUBJECT
: Customer Data Subjects are individuals that interact with our Customers through our Applications. These include our Customers’ current and prospective clients, members, attendees, sponsors, exhibitors, marketing partners, hotel guests or other business contacts. For example, Customer Data Subjects include individuals that register for an event organized by a Customer, download an event-related mobile app, participate in a virtual event organized by a Customer, complete an online survey, or make a hotel or meeting space reservation using one of Cvent's Applications.
VISITORS
: Individuals and prospective customers who interact with our Websites (for instance, to access our Supplier Network without registration (as a non-Customer), to read about Cvent products and services, download a white paper, or sign up for an online demo); those who attend Cvent marketing events (for instance, Cvent CONNECT
®,
Cvent live events and webinars); those who we meet at a tradeshow; or those who we learn about from third parties or other external sources.
Cvent’s direct customers are organizations and businesses that use our Applications to process personal data about their Customer Data Subjects. Cvent processes personal data about Customer Data Subjects in our Applications as a “data processor” or “service provider” only according to our Customers’ instructions.  If you are a Customer Data Subject and have questions about how a Cvent Customer uses your data or want to exercise your rights regarding your personal data, you should direct your request or inquiry to the Cvent Customer that controls your data.  For example, if you have attended an event hosted by a Cvent Customer, you should direct your data rights requests to the host of your event.
What types of personal data do our Customers collect?
Our Applications are flexible and allow our Customers to collect a variety of personal data from and about their Customer Data Subjects, including name, organization, title, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, social media account ID, credit or debit card number and other information including but not limited to meal preferences, interests, opinions, activities, and occupation. We encourage Customer Data Subjects to review the Customers’ privacy policies to further understand the types of data collected.
For a more detailed list of our Applications, please refer to the section titled “
What are Cvent's products covered by this policy?”
. Cvent’s use of personal information collected through our Applications shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our Customers have engaged Cvent, to improve our services, or as required or permitted by law.
If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you may choose not to use our Applications.
How do our Customers collect personal data?
Customers can use our customizable Applications to collect personal data in a variety of ways as outlined in the examples below.
When Customer Data Subjects voluntarily and explicitly enter personal data into our Applications.
When our Customers enter Customer Data Subjects into our Applications, when permitted, including by having a legitimate business interest or obtaining consent from a Customer Data Subject.
Automatically, as Customer Data Subjects interact with our Applications, using commonly used information gathering technologies such as cookies. For additional information about these technologies, see the section below titled  “
How does Cvent use cookies and similar technologies?
How do our Customers use personal data?
If a Customer Data Subject chooses to use our Applications to conduct business with a Customer (for example: to register for or check into an event, respond to an online survey, download a mobile application, make a room reservation, or send or respond to a Request for Proposal (“RFP”)), any information provided in connection with that interaction will be transferred to, and under the control of, the Customer.
Customers will also have access to information (including personal data and Application usage data) related to how Customer Data Subject interact with the Applications they use. In such instances, the Customers are the data controllers of the Customer Data Subject’s personal data, under the European Economic Area (“EEA”) data protection laws.  Therefore, Cvent cannot and does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of Customers.
The information practices of our Customers are governed by their privacy policies. We encourage Customer Data Subjects to review the Customers’ privacy policies to understand their practices and procedures.
Does Cvent use or sell personal data collected by our Customers?
As a service provider, Cvent does not use personal data of our Customer Data Subjects for any purposes other than to provide services that our Customers have contracted us to provide through our Applications, as noted below, to improve our services, or as required or permitted by law. Cvent does not sell personal data of our Customer Data Subjects for monetary or other consideration.  Furthermore, Cvent does not share Customer Data Subject personal data with any third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration.
How does Cvent collect and process personal data from our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects?
We collect personal data from our Customers in order to facilitate communication and delivery of the Applications that our Customers are interested in or contract us to provide. For example, we may collect Customer contact information, whether through the execution of a contract, use of our services, a form on our Website, queries submitted to our chat agent, an interaction with our sales or customer support team, sign up for an event, or a response to one of our surveys or marketing emails. We may also collect credit card information (e.g., credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) or other customary bank information needed for billing and payment purposes.
We may record and store Customer and Visitor support chats, messages, phone calls, video calls, teleconferences and web conferences (including audio and video content) for legitimate business interests related to providing Customer support, compliance with laws, training and coaching, process improvement, and quality assurance.  We may analyze the content of our support communications using data analytics tools to gain better insights into our interactions with customers. We will always notify you before a call will be recorded and will obtain consent from you where required by law.
We and our vendors collect Customer usage information about how our Customers interact with our Applications. This includes which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you perform certain actions, what language preference you have, what you buy, and so on.
We process Customer’s and their Customer Data Subjects’ personal data in the following manner:
To disclose to our subsidiaries and affiliates for the purpose of providing services to our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects.
To disclose to contractors, service providers, and other third parties as reasonably necessary or prudent to provide, maintain and support our Applications for our Customers and their Customer Data Subjects, such as, for example, payment processors and data center or Web hosting providers.
To deliver the services that our Customer has contracted us to provide through our Applications. Some examples include:
If a Customer Data Subject uses one of our Applications to register for an event, we will use their provided e-mail address to send them information and announcements relating to that event.
If a Customer Data Subject uses one of our Applications to pay for event registration fees or other products and services using their credit cards, we will pass the credit card information to payment card processors to validate the payment information and complete the transactions.
When a Customer submits an RFP to a meeting space provider listed on the Cvent Supplier Network, or to a Customer's Business Contact as directed by the Customer, Cvent will contact that venue, management company or Customer Data Subject and disclose information, which contains personal data, necessary for it to respond to the RFP.
When a Customer reserves a meeting space or hotel room at a venue utilizing Cvent’s InstantBook service, Cvent will share necessary personal data with the venue directly or via that venue’s technology platform, in order to complete the booking directly with Customer.
When a Customer or Customer Data Subject uses their social media credentials to share information on their social media platform or to log into one of our Applications, we will share information with their social media account provider. The information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.
To disclose to event organizers, exhibitors, or other attendees, as directed by a Customer or consented to by a Customer Data Subject, such as by consenting to having an exhibitor scan their event badge to share their contact information, opting-in or clicking to give consent to receive exhibitor information, or actively consenting to share information in a Cvent Application (e.g., name, contact information, profile picture, survey responses, Q&A features, comments, messages, poll responses, etc.).
As instructed by Customer, to connect Customer Data Subjects with one another by relying on matching algorithms to recommend compatible Customer Data Subjects for optional business networking.
To deliver to a third party in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, recapitalization, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all Cvent’s assets, whether as a continuing operating business or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal data held by Cvent about our Customers and Customer Data Subjects is among the assets transferred.
For our internal business purposes that include administering access and use of our Applications, data analysis, securely identifying Customers upon logging onto an Application, enhancing or modifying our Applications, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, billing for Services, and operating our business.
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; and (c) to protect against or identify fraudulent transactions.

Where permitted, we may use Customer personal information collected from and about the Customer to deliver tailored advertising and marketing to the Customer: (i) on our Applications, (ii) on third-party sites and mobile apps not affiliated with Cvent, and (iii) through direct marketing (for example: e-mail, mail, SMS, phone), for ourselves and for Cvent Customers. Customers may change their communications preferences with Cvent via the subscription management form provided under: “
How Can a Customer or Visitor Manage their Cvent Email preferences?
”  If a Customer wishes to have their information excluded from this type of use, click
here
to submit the request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information and see section titled “
How to Manage and Control Cookies and Similar Technologies
”.
What is the legal basis for Cvent to process personal data?
For individuals that are from the European Economic Area (EEA) or other regions that stipulate a lawful basis for processing personal information (such as under GDPR Article 6), our legal basis for collecting and using their personal information will depend on the nature and circumstances of the processing activity. Where we are the processor for our Customers, our legal basis may be fulfilment of a contract or consent. Where we are the controller, our legal basis will be consent or legitimate interest where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by the individual’s data protection interests, or fundamental rights and freedoms. These interests are to provide individuals with access to the Applications and features of the Applications; to send them information they have requested; to ensure the security of our Applications by trying to prevent unauthorised or malicious activities; or to enforce compliance with our terms of use, contracts and other policies.
How long does Cvent store personal data collected by our Customers?
Unless otherwise provided in our contract with our Customer, we process the data until 90 days after the termination of the contract, at which time we remove it from our production environment. Within 13 months, we remove the data from our backup media.
How can a Customer Data Subject access, correct or delete their personal data?
Depending on their jurisdiction,
Customer Data Subjects have the right to request access to
their personal data and, if necessary, have it amended, deleted or restricted. Customer Data Subjects can also ask for some types of personal data to be delivered to them, or another organization they nominate, in a structured and machine-readable format.
Where we process your personal data on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. See the Cvent contact section below. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Customer Data Subjects in the EEA also have the right to complain to a supervisory authority for data protection in the country where they live, or where they work – although we hope that we can assist with any queries or concerns you have about our use of your personal data.
Cvent processes Customer Data Subjects' data under the direction of our Customers and has no direct control or ownership of the personal data we process. Customers are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws requiring notice, disclosure or obtaining consent prior to transferring the data to Cvent for processing purposes. Any Customer Data Subject that seeks to access, correct or delete data, should direct their query to the Customer. If the Customer requests Cvent to delete, rectify or access the personal data of a Customer Data Subject to comply with data protection regulations, Cvent will process this request within the required time under the applicable regulation or law.
We will not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In such instances, we will inform the Customer about the legal obligations that prevent us from fulfilling the request.
How can a Customer access, correct, or delete their personal data?
Customers have the same rights to access, correct or delete their personal data as outlined above.
Any Customer can access, correct or delete their data, or their Customer Data Subject data by submitting a request on our Website at
https://www.cvent.com/personal-data-requests

How does Cvent use cookies and similar technologies?
Cookies and Web Beacons
We and authorized third parties use cookies or similar automatic data collection technologies as individuals interact with our Website or our Applications to collect certain information about their equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including d
etails of your visits to our Applications, such as the date and time you access our Applications, length of time you spend on our Applications, websites that linked to our Applications or websites linked from our Applications, the resources and content that you access and use on the Applications; i
nformation about your computer and internet connection, such as your IP Address, computer type, screen resolution, language, Internet browser type and version. We do not use any of these technologies to collect information from Customer Data Subjects for marketing or advertising purposes.  Our Customers may add cookies or other similar technologies through our Applications for their own purposes, including for marketing purposes.
Browser Cookies.
A cookie is a small file placed on a computer hard drive.  Web browsers can be configured to restrict or entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device.  Information on how to do this is provided by the web browser’s help/reference section. Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may prevent a Customer or Customer Data Subject from using certain portions of our Applications, depending on how the browser settings are configured.  For example, event registration cannot be completed successfully if cookies are disabled in the web browser. Unless the browser setting has been adjusted so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when the browser interacts with our Applications.
Purpose.
Our Website and Applications use cookies that serve the following purpose types:
Strictly necessary (essential)
. Strictly necessary cookies make our Website work, they are essential for the Website to perform its basic functions.
Performance
.  Also known as “statistics cookies”, and including analytics cookies, performance cookies collect information about how you use a website, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked on. None of this information can be used to identify you. Their sole purpose is to improve website functions. This includes cookies from third-party analytics services as long as the cookies are for the exclusive use of the owner of the website visited.
Functionality
.  Also known as “preferences” cookies, these cookies allow a website to remember choices you have made in the past, like what language you prefer.  They are used to enhance the user experience of the website but are non-essential to their use, but without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
Marketing
.  These cookies track your online activity to help advertisers deliver more relevant advertising or to limit how many times you see an ad. These cookies can share that information with other organizations or advertisers. These are persistent cookies and almost always of third-party provenance.
Web Beacons.
Pages in our Applications and emails
will
contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs).  Web beacons differ from cookies in that the information is not stored on your hard drive, but invisibly embedded on web pages or in email.  Web beacons permit us to track online movements of web users, for example: to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).  This enables Cvent to provide a website experience more tailored to our users’ preferences and interests.
More about Marketing Cookies.
We use information collected from our venue sourcing Customers to enable us to display advertisements from our Hospitality Cloud Customers to their target audience of users through our network or our advertising service providers.  As one example, meeting space providers purchase advertisements that are presented selectively through the Cvent Supplier Network to meeting planners who have previously awarded a minimum volume of meetings business to that provider or to competing venues in the target metropolitan area.  Even though we do not disclose personal data for these purposes, if the venue sourcing user clicks on or otherwise interacts with an advertisement, the advertising Hospitality Cloud Customer assumes that the venue sourcing user meets its target criteria. While we and our Hospitality Cloud Customers leverage this technology to advertise to Customers, we never use our Customer's information to advertise to Customer Data Subjects.  We also use third parties (such as LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, YouTube) to serve advertisements that may be of interest to you on other websites.
More about Performance Cookies.
We use third party analytics providers, including Google, Adobe, Mixpanel, Mouseflow and others, to collect information about the usage of our Applications and Websites to enable us to improve how they work.  The information allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Applications, helps us record any difficulties you have with the Applications, shows us whether our advertising is effective or not, and allows us to use responses to advertisements to optimize ad performance.  Google Analytics, Adobe and Mixpanel use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information about the usage of our Applications and to report website trends to us, without storing any personal data on external third-party analytics provider platforms.

Our Policy
Welcome to the web site (the "
Site
") of Cvent, Inc.
("
Wedding Spot
",
                "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by Wedding Spot and has been created to provide information about our
                company and our services for searching, pricing and comparing wedding venues and related vendors,
mobile applications and related services (together with the Site, the "
Services
") to our Service visitors
                ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth Wedding Spot's policy with respect to information including personally
                identifiable data ("
Personal Data
") and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and
                Services.
Information We Collect
When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further
                described below:
Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:
We collect Personal Data from you when you
                voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register
                for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Wedding Spot collects Personal Data we make an effort to
                provide a link to this Privacy Policy. You also may provide information to be published or displayed on public areas of the
                Site, or transmitted to other users of the Site or third parties (collectively, "User Contributions"). Your User
                Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Please be aware that no security measures are
                perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Site with whom you may choose to
                share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by
                unauthorized persons.
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy
                    Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be
                    transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Wedding Spot and the authorized third parties
                    referred to herein located in the United States.
Other Information:
Non-Identifiable Data:
When you interact with Wedding Spot through the Services, we receive and
                store certain personally non-identifiable information, including but not limited to, your wedding options and preferences,
                your geographic interests, and your costs and budgets. Such information, which is collected passively using various
                technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Wedding Spot may store such information itself or such
                information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Wedding Spot affiliates, agents or service providers. The
                Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to
                our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.
                We may also disclose non-identifiable data to third parties for advertising purposes. It is important to note that no
                Personal Data is available or used in this process.
In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer
                that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional
                functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on
                your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once
                during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your
                permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for
                information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend
                that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.

                Services, Wedding Spot often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal
                Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Wedding
                Spot may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not
                identify you personally. Wedding Spot may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to
                current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

                users and to improve the Services. Wedding Spot and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to
                tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will
                contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time
                you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists,
                please contact us as indicated below.
If Wedding Spot intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will
                be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:
Wedding Spot is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our
                relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third
                parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
Business Transfers:
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of
                a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
Related Companies:
We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent
                with this Privacy Policy.
Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:
Wedding Spot, like many businesses, sometimes hires other
                companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining
                databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them
                with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
Legal Requirements:
Wedding Spot may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the
                good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or
                property of Wedding Spot, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the
                public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
Your Choices:
You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be
                able to use certain Services.
Exclusions
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Wedding Spot other than Personal Data collected through
                the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Wedding Spot through the
                Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the
                Services, such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited
                submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential
                and Wedding Spot shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without
                limitation or attribution.
Children:
Wedding Spot does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13,
                please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
                children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal
                Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
                Personal Data to Wedding Spot through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from
                our databases.
Links to Other Web Sites:
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or
                controlled by Wedding Spot (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the
                Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Wedding Spot endorses or has reviewed the Third Party
                Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
Integrating Social Networking Services
One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable or log in to the Services via various social
                networking services like Facebook or Twitter ("Social Networking Service(s)"). By directly integrating these services, we
                make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to log into or
                grant us permission via the relevant Social Networking Service. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the
                Service or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant information
                necessary to enable the Service to access that Social Networking Service and your data contained within that Social
                Networking Service. As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain
                information that you have provided to the Social Networking Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use, store
                and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Wedding Spot shall have no liability or
                responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Networking Services that may be enabled within the
                Service.
You may also have the option of posting your Services activities to Social Networking Services when you access content
                through the Services (for example, you may post to Facebook that you performed an activity on the Service); you acknowledge
                that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any Social Networking Services you have
                enabled will be able to view such activity.
Security:
Wedding Spot takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and
                unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure
                or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care
                in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Wedding
                Spot via the Internet.
