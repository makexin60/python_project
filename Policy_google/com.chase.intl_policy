Introduction
Banking is personal and it involves data about you. Nearly everything you do with us or on our website or app will involve the collection, creation, use, or sharing of data. Data about you helps us provide you with the best customer experience, understand you better and anticipate your needs. This is true whether it’s data you give us, that we collect through your use of our services, receive from others, or create through data analytics and more. It also helps us secure your accounts, improve our app and product offerings, deliver relevant marketing and advertising, and meet our legal obligations.
Our objective with this policy is to explain how and why we collect, create, use, share, store, and delete data. We’ll also outline the controls we offer to help you take advantage of the important rights you have with regards to your data, including privacy settings, notifications, marketing elections, website cookies management, and customer support.
About this Policy
This policy is provided by J.P. Morgan Europe Limited (25 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5JP, UK) as a so-called data controller under the UK Data Protection Act. This policy applies to all of our consumer banking and related services (referred to as the “Chase Services”). The terms that cover your account and other products and actual use of the Chase Services can be found within our app.
Over time, we’ll improve our Chase Services. We also expect to develop new ones. If this materially changes how we collect, create, use, share, store, and delete your data, we’ll update this policy. If you ever have questions or concerns, please get in touch.

Personal Data We Collect and Create
These are the types of data we collect, create, use, and share:
Personal Details and Identifiers
Your full name, home address, email address, phone number, social media profile details and information that is used to verify your identity. This can be photo ID, passport number, national insurance number, driving license number, and nationality.
Authentication Data
The data used to access the Chase Services. It includes your PIN number(s), password(s), security questions and answers. It also includes your unique account and user profile identifiers and biometric data used for identity verification.
Financial Information
Information used to assess your financial situation, and whether you’re suitable to receive financial credit. This includes your income, residential status, employment information, credit profile data, credit rating, and publicly available information (such as County Court Judgements or bankruptcy).
Account Information
Details relating to any account that you hold with us. This includes your account number, sort code, cards, account balance, unique identifiers, alerts, language settings, statement preferences, contact preferences, and overdraft limit.
Transaction History
Events like payments made and received (including those via third parties such as Apple Pay, Google Pay or PayPal), credits/debits, payees and payors, interest calculation and payments, and standing orders.
Health and Disability Data
Data that you may provide to us relating to a disability or health issue(s) which is relevant to your use of Chase Services. We will use the health data you provide to us to support your use of Chase services where needed. This might include the accessibility of our website or app, or a change in your health status that impacts your use of Chase Services.
Communications Data
Records and results of any communications between you and us. This includes by email, telephone, in-app chat, social media, and letter. This might include open rates and dates/times, whether it was forwarded, and your interaction with the communication.
Device and Technical Data
Data such as unique device identifiers, IP addresses, device type and model, as well as operating system and version. This might also include network connection type, browser type, advertising ID and non-precise location data. We might infer that from other data such as IP address.
Biometric Data
We create temporary facial recognition templates when we match your selfie to your photo ID as part of onboarding or when you reset your pin, unlock your account, or change your device. We also use behavioural biometric data, such as typing patterns and movement data.
Location Data
Your postcode, IP address and location data from your payment transactions. This might include location data from your device if you allow location sharing in the app.
Usage Data
Data generated from your website or in-app activity, such as what screens or product features you use and how long you spend using features within the app or on our site.
Cookies
We collect information from your device, or store information on your device, in the form of cookies. We use this information to:
help maintain the security of the Chase Services
help ensure that our website and app communicate correctly with our other services
remember your choices and settings
collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes – to help us understand how users use our services and help us improve them
Our Cookie Notice is available on our website and in our app.
Your Feedback or Opinions
If you choose to take part in our research initiatives, we’ll analyse your views and feedback to create insights that help us understand what people think about our brand. This will also help shape changes to our Chase Services and marketing campaigns.
Identity Verification
We use automated processes to check your identity. This can be when you’re onboarding as a new customer, unlocking your account, resetting your PIN, or changing your device.
To check it’s really you, we use facial recognition technology. This technology checks that the person in a selfie and an accepted photo ID are actually the same person. The faces in both photos are compared by creating a mathematical template based on measurement of the various points on your face – such as your chin, nose, and eyes.
The templates created through this matching process are temporary and not accessible to us. The templates are created by a vendor on our behalf, and deleted shortly after we have confirmed you are the same person in both photos. When this process does not create a match, it will be reviewed by an agent. We do not store your details for any other purpose, and our vendors don’t either.
Onboarding Checks
When you apply for new Chase Services, we screen your personal details against fraud and credit reference databases in order to help prevent fraud and money laundering and also confirm that you meet our credit history eligibility criteria to bank with us. The results could prevent you from using the requested Chase Service.
Transaction Fraud
We also use automated decision making to help ensure transactions made on your account are correct and free from fraud. Your transactions (payments to and from your account) will be assessed to identify any unusual payments. Unusual payments include payments you would not normally make or haven’t yet made on our systems. We may stop or decline a payment that is likely to be fraudulent.
Credit and Affordability Assessments
If you apply for a credit product, we may use automated decisions through our Credit Decision Engine in order to assess if the product is suitable and appropriate for you.
To determine your eligibility, we look at the information you provided as part of your credit application. This includes data from Credit Reference Agencies, such as your credit history, which will show us if you have kept up with repayments or if you have any county court judgements or bankruptcies on your credit file. We combine this with other financial information we hold about you, such as your Chase current account data, to make the following automated decisions:
To assess if the product we have built is suitable to you
To make fair and informed decisions about how to lend responsibly
To determine if we can offer credit to you and how much
Examples of automated decisions may include:
Automatically calculating credit limit
To ensure we don't send marketing communications to you about our credit products where it is not relevant
To help us determine our overall credit risk as a bank and work out strategies for our products in a way that does not adversely affect you.
Our Credit Decision Engine is an automated system that uses various rules and scoring methods. These rules and scoring methods are regularly tested to ensure they remain consistent, effective, fair, and unbiased. You have rights in relation to automated decision making, including a right to appeal if your application is declined. If we reject your application, we will inform you of the outcome and the main reason. You can get in touch with us via our Customer Support for your application to be reviewed.
Sometimes, and when you’ve got a marker for financial difficulty or a Notice of Correction on your credit file, we’ll carry out a manual review so that we can get a better picture of your finances and make a decision about your application.
You can ask for information about any automated decision making that has a legal or similarly significant effect on you. We’ll explain the logic involved, how we use the decision and any potential consequences. You can also object, give us extra information or ask us to review a decision. In certain circumstances, you also have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.

‘Your ID’ is an additional feature in the Chase app. If you opt into ‘Your ID’, we’ll set it up using some of the data you’ve already given us.
When you joined Chase, you used either your passport or driver’s licence as proof of ID. ‘Your ID’ stores and presents a digital copy of the identity document you used, and related identity document data, in the Chase app – so you can access it, share it, or use it to complete forms.
You can opt into ‘Your ID’ from the Chase app. If you do so, we’ll automatically set it up using the following data from your passport or driver’s licence:
Identification document reference number
‘Your ID’ identifier
Personal details

Your score factors: a set of explanations to help you understand what impacts your score.

When you check your credit information in the Chase app, you’re making a ’Data Subject Access Request’ to TransUnion. This allows TransUnion to share your updated credit information with us at enrolment and on an on-going basis.
Each time you do this, a soft search is recorded on your credit report. A soft search does not impact your credit rating, or your ability to get credit.
Why we need to use your data

We’ll also use your data to share personalised insights with you, or suggest relevant products (if you have consented to Chase using your data in this way or because Chase has a legitimate interest in using your data in this way to improve our products). These interests will never be overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

Credit Reference Agencies
This section explains how we work with Credit Reference Agencies if you hold a current account with us or if you apply for a credit product.
We run a check against the Credit Reference Agencies database when you open a current account with us to confirm that you meet our credit history criteria and on a regular basis for the duration of your relationship with us to make sure your account is not involved in fraud. These are soft checks that do not leave a visible footprint on your credit file or impact your credit score.
We share details of your Chase current account with Credit Reference Agencies on a periodic basis. This will include details of funds going into the account, and the account balance. The Credit Reference Agencies may share this information with other organisations that wish to check your financial status to help them build a more complete picture of your finances.
If you apply for a credit product with us, we will carry out credit and identity checks with Credit Reference Agencies. When CRAs receive a request from us as part of your credit application, they will note it on your credit file, and this will be visible to other lenders. This is called a credit search. This information will be used by lenders to work out how much they can lend to you and how much you can afford to repay. If you apply for a product with someone else, your records will be linked by the CRAs. These links will stay on your credit file and will be visible to all lenders you apply to.
When you se our credit products, we also conduct periodic searches with CRAs to manage your account. To do this, we supply your personal information from your credit application to CRAs and they give us details about you. This includes information about your financial situation and financial standing. We will share details about your repayments, outstanding debts, and transaction records. We will also use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, manage your credit card and recover debts.
If you have applied for our credit card, we will use the information from CRAs to:
Carry out credit checks
Assess if we can offer you credit and how much
Assess whether you are able to make repayments
Trace and recover debts

Once we no longer need to retain your data in a form that identifies you, we will permanently delete or destroy it, archive, and secure it so that it is beyond practical use; or anonymize it.
