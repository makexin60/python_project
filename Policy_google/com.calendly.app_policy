FERPA and COPPA Privacy Notice and Privacy Notice for Children
Effective Date
: March 8, 2024
FERPA and COPPA Privacy Notice
Children under the age of 18 shall only use the Services as an Invitee and under the supervision of their parent/guardian or school/educator and are specifically prohibited from the use of the Services otherwise. The Services are not intended for use by children as Users and are not intended for Children to create Calendly accounts. If Customer is a school or educator in the United States and wants its students to use the Services as an Invitee, Customer is and shall be responsible for complying with the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA") and Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, “COPPA”).
To the extent that Calendly has access to “education records,” as defined by the Family Educational Rights & Privacy Acts of 1974 and its implementing regulations (“FERPA”), it is deemed and shall function as a “school official” with “legitimate educational interests” when fulfilling its responsibilities under this Agreement, and both parties agree that Customer has “direct control” over the use of “education records” as these terms are defined under FERPA. Calendly agrees to comply with its obligations under FERPA, including but not limited to the limitations on re-disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records set forth in FERPA and with the terms set forth below.
This means Customer shall notify those students' parents/guardians of the personally identifiable information that it will collect and share with Calendly and obtain parental/guardian consent before its students use the Services. When obtaining such consent, Customer shall provide parents/guardians with a copy of our Privacy Policies. Customer must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. Additionally, Customer shall be responsible for verifying the student-parent relationship and shall be responsible for compliance with the right of a parent to review personal information provided by the child. Customer shall comply with such requirements by using the appropriate features in the Services to address any data subject request for the aforementioned data, or any changes to such data requested by parent, and providing the data to the parent after verification of the student-parent relationship. Calendly will assist Customer with any such request to the extent Customer is unable to act on the request itself using the Services. If Customer is located outside of the United States, Calendly shall rely upon Customer and Customer shall obtain any required consents or approvals from the parent or guardian of any student covered by similar laws and, as a condition to Customer's and its students' use of the Services, Customer shall comply with such laws.
Calendly Privacy Notice for Children
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA") and their rules (collectively, "COPPA") require us to inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this policy, "parents") about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children. It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child's parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child's personal information.
This section notifies parents of:
The types of information we may collect from children.
How we use the information we collect.
Our practices for disclosing that information.
Our practices for notifying and obtaining parents' consent when we collect personal information from children, including how a parent may revoke consent.
All operators that collect or maintain information from children through this Service.
This policy only applies to children and supplements the
Calendly Privacy Notice
. The Calendly Privacy Notice applies to adults.
Terms that are defined in the Calendly Privacy Notice have the same meanings as used in this Privacy Notice for Children.
Information We Collect from Children
We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Services as an Invitee. Calendly’s Services do not include making children’s personal information publicly available. The Services are not intended to be used by children under age 18 as Users. In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Services. We encourage parents to educate their children about safe internet use and to monitor their children's use of the internet. Calendly has established and will maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children as described in the Calendly Privacy Notice.
Information We Collect Directly
The only information necessary to collect from a child to schedule a meeting using the Services as an Invitee is a name, email address, date, and time.
Automatic Information Collection and Tracking
Information Collected Automatically From You
We and our authorized third parties use Cookies, pixels, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device (subject to your consent, opt-out preferences or other appropriate legal basis where legally required). Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Website and Services, improve your experience, tailor marketing messages, and help us detect and prevent fraud and security risks. Here is more specific information about the types of information we collect:
Log & Device Data.
When you access the Website or the Services, we and our authorized third parties may automatically record certain information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website. This log data may include the web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or approximate location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
Cookie Data.
Depending on how you’re accessing our Services and subject to your consent, opt-out preferences, or other appropriate legal basis where legally required, we and our authorized third parties may use “Cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our Website, unique to your Calendly account or your browser) or similar technologies such as pixels or web beacons to record log data. When we use Cookies, we may use ‘session’ Cookies (that last until you close your browser) or ‘persistent’ Cookies (that last until you or your browser deletes them). Calendly provides a centralized cookie management service across the entire Calendly Website. When visiting the Calendly Website or a booking page for the first time, Invitees and Visitors will see a cookie banner in accordance with their region. Cookie preferences can be adjusted at any time. Invitees can click on “Cookie Settings” within any booking page they receive. Invitees and Visitors can also navigate to the footer of the Calendly Website at any time and change their Cookie preferences under “Cookie Settings” or “Your Privacy Choices.” (
For Prelude service Invitees only,
you can opt out through the “Cookie Preferences” link made available to you on the booking page you receive from a Prelude User.)
Usage Data.
When a child uses our Services as an Invitee, we and our authorized third parties collect certain information about how you use the Services.  For example, we collect information on the meeting types used most often, and how many meetings are scheduled each day. We aggregate this information and use it to help us monitor and improve the Services, such as to determine which features are most popular amongst our Users, and which features could be added or improved.
Third-Party Tools
We may disclose information to third parties or allow third parties to directly collect information using these technologies on our Website, such as social media companies, advertising networks, companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting, security providers, and others that help us operate our Services and Website.  We use such third-party tools subject to your consent, opt-out preferences, or other appropriate legal basis where legally required. For example, we use third-party providers such as Google Analytics to provide certain analytics and Visitor interactions services to Calendly in connection with our operation of our Website, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information regarding the characteristics and activities of Visitors to the Calendly Website. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
. We also use session replay, session recording, and similar tools provided by third party Service Providers (as defined below) to record your interactions with our Website, such as how you move throughout our Website and engage with our webforms. In addition to analytics, this information helps us improve our Website and Services, our marketing activities, and identify and fix technical issues visitors may be having with our Website.
Certain third-party tools may not be opted out of and are essential to our service. For example, Calendly has implemented Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise to help prevent spam and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. This information is not used by Google for personalized advertising. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to
Google’s Privacy Policy
and
Terms of Use
.
We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to schedule a meeting, and we do not condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary.
We also may combine non-personal information we collect through these technologies with personal information about you or your child that we collect online.
For information about our automatic information collection practices, including how you can opt out of certain information collection, see the Calendly Notice.
How We Use Your Child's Information
We may use information that we collect about you, including Personal Data, to:
Provide the Calendly Service. We will use your information to provide our  Services to you, including to facilitate scheduling; respond to your inquiries; prevent or address service errors, security, or technical issues; analyze and monitor usage; prevent spam, fraud and abuse on the Services; investigate potential violations of our Terms, verify your identity; and for other customer service and support purposes.
Understand and improve our products. We will perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, Services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others. We do this to help make our products better and to develop new products.
Communicate with you.
Service related communications. We will email you regarding your calendar appointments. These messages are considered part of the service and you may not opt out of these messages.
Responding to your requests. We will also use your information to respond to your questions or comments.
Protecting Rights and Interests. We will use your information to protect our rights and interests as well as the rights and interests of our Users and any other person, as well as to enforce this Notice or our Terms.

Other. We also may use your information to manage our business or perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection subject to your consent.
Our Practices for Disclosing Children's Information
We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer children's personal information other than as described in this section.
We may disclose aggregated information about many of our users, and information that does not identify any individual or device. In addition, we may disclose children's personal information:
To third parties we use to support the internal operations of our Service and who are bound by contractual or other obligations to use the information only for such purpose and to keep the information confidential.
If we are required to do so by law or legal process, such as to comply with any court order or subpoena or to respond to any government or regulatory request.
If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Calendly, our customers or others, including to:
protect the safety of a child;
protect the safety and security of the Website or Services; or
enable us to take precautions against liability.
To law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.
In addition, if Calendly is involved in a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Calendly's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding or event, we may transfer the personal information we have collected or maintain to the buyer or other successor.
Accessing and Correcting Your Child's Personal Information
At any time, you may review the child's personal information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete the personal information, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the child's information.
You can review, change, or delete your child's personal information by sending us an email at
privacy@calendly.com
. To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to take certain steps or provide additional information to verify your identity before we provide any information or make corrections.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.

from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Clearbit Privacy Policy
Clearbit Privacy Policy
Last updated: February 28, 2025
This Privacy Policy describes how we process, handle, or otherwise maintain data we collect, including in connection with your use of our products, services, APIs, apps, and websites that link to this policy (we refer to these collectively as our "Services").
Clearbit is committed to protecting and processing your personal information responsibly. We value the data you share with us and treat it with respect.
Welcome to Clearbit! So, Who Are We?
APIHub, Inc. dba Clearbit is a HubSpot affiliate ("Clearbit," "we," "us," etc.). To contact us, see the "Contact Us!" section below.
Clearbit, a B2B Marketing Intelligence tool, provides go-to-market teams with a comprehensive B2B dataset across company, contact, and IP address intelligence. By using our full dataset, customers are able to enrich key systems, build products, and power personalization.
Our Services are designed to help our customers and partners in a wide variety of ways, including by helping them determine which companies might make the best customers, identify the contacts within those organizations by department, role, or seniority to improve or expedite their interactions with those companies, and enabling them to personalize their interactions with those companies.
What does this Privacy Policy apply to?
This Privacy Policy applies to information Clearbit collects or maintains, including through our websites that link to this policy ("Site"), software (including APIs, browser extensions, and integrations with third-party software) and other Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to other HubSpot websites, products, or services that link to the
HubSpot Privacy Policy
.
This Privacy Policy includes additional notices that may apply to you if you live in certain jurisdictions, such as residents of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Brazil, or California.
These notices may include information on how to exercise certain rights you may have with respect to personal information. Please see the section below titled "Additional Notices for Specific Jurisdictions" for more details.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any companies we don't control, including the privacy practices of our customers. For example, our customers may obtain information from Clearbit about business contacts or prospects. We do not control their use and disclosure of this information. In certain circumstances, we act as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, and in those circumstances, it is the customer that is responsible for the processing of your personal information. For clarity, if we process personal information under an agreement in which Clearbit acts as a processor or service provider to a customer, that agreement governs the processing of your personal information and not this Privacy Policy. If you have any concerns with the privacy practices of our customers or other third parties, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of those entities.

Clearbit Indexers
Our proprietary indexing systems ("Clearbit Indexers") collect information from a variety of sources in order to compile "Attribute Data" about corporations, non-profits, and similar entities ("Companies") and the professionals that work for them ("Professionals"). A complete list of Attribute Data we make available to users of the Site and Services can be found at
www.clearbit.com/attributes
.
Our Clearbit Indexers collect a variety of information and data for purposes of creating our database of Attribute Data and for providing, improving, and maintaining the Services. We collect personal information as Attribute Data, and to help us compile, organize, and verify Attribute Data, in the following ways:
(1) from publicly accessible sources, both online and offline, algorithmically through the Clearbit Indexers or provided by third parties;
(2) through licensing agreements directly with data brokers or other Companies; and
(3) directly contributed by individuals about both Professionals and Companies, except where such information is provided pursuant to an agreement in which Clearbit acts as a processor or service provider.
We use Attribute Data to provide the Services, for internal research and development purposes, and to maintain and improve the quality of our Services. We may also use Attribute Data to collect metadata, such as activity signals or IP registration information. We use this metadata to improve the quality of the Clearbit Indexers, and to verify the accuracy, integrity, and completeness of our Attribute Data.
Our Services are designed to help our customers and partners in a wide variety of ways, including by helping them determine which companies might make the best customers, identify the contacts within those organizations by department, role or seniority that might improve or expedite their interactions with those companies, and enabling them to personalize their interactions with those companies.

Consent
: Where you have given consent to such processing for one or more specific purposes.
Contractual Obligation
: Where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you.
Legal Obligation
: Where processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligation.
Legitimate Interest
: Where processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of our customers (e.g. making available Business Profile Information to our customers (us), direct marketing and sales activities (our customers)), and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests.
Your Data Subject Rights
The laws of your jurisdiction may give you the right to:
be informed, access, rectify, or erase any personal information we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal information we have collected about you.

Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include needing to continue processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may require specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request, including, at a minimum, your name and email address.

Protection and Retention of Information
Clearbit considers the security of all the information and data within our control to be a top priority, and consistent with this we implement technical and organizational safeguards to protect from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, such information or data. However, no security system is impenetrable, and unanticipated system failures or the efforts of malicious actors are an unfortunate reality on the internet. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the information and data within our control, including personal information, is absolutely secure.
Clearbit retains the information described in this Privacy Policy for as long as is necessary to comply with legal obligations, enforce our agreements, maintain existing relationships with our customers, and otherwise as might be necessary for our legitimate business interests.

As we are United States company, any information provided to us, will be stored, processed, and transferred within, or to, the United States. Please be aware that the US and jurisdictions other than the one in which you are located may not have the same data protection laws as your own jurisdiction.
Your personal data is also processed by staff or service providers operating outside the EEA in the United States, who work for us.
Where we receive your information from publishers, advertisers or other ad technology partners, and they are located in the UK or EEA, we rely on standard contractual clauses for such transfers.
Your Choices and Opting Out of Interest Based Advertising
As described above, as part of our Services we receive IP addresses, cookie IDs, and/or hashed email addresses from our customers who collected this information from your previous visit to their website or application. We receive this information to make inferences about your interests in order to provide advertising relevant to you based on these interests. This practice is known as interest-based advertising. MNTN adheres to the IAB’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
You can use your device settings, such as “Limit Ad Tracking,” to exercise choice regarding our collection and use of information for interest-based advertising from websites and mobile applications on your device. You also have the following opt-out choices:
NAI Opt-Out
MNTN is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”), and MNTN adheres
to the NAI Code of Conduct. Click here if you would like further information regarding
the DAA principles and here if you would like information about the NAI Code of Conduct
.  To receive more information about your choices, including to opt out of
receiving interest-based ads from many third parties, please go to:
http://optout.aboutads.info/
. For more information about opting out on mobile devices, please go to:
https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice
.
Browser Opt-Out – Do Not Track
Many browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. We follow DNT settings. You can usually access your browser’s DNT option in your browser’s preferences.
Note that if you exercise choices regarding interest-based advertising you will still see advertising in websites and mobile apps, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests. Data may still be collected from your device with your consent for purposes other than interest-based advertising after you make your choices. If you use different devices, or reset your device identifier, you may need to make your choices again.
Retention of data
MNTN stores data collected to provide the Services for a rolling period of two (2) years from the last website visit of our customers’ websites. Reporting data (which does not contain any personal data), is stored for the duration of the contract we have with our customers.  Reporting data may be deleted at the customer’s request, and in in all cases two (2) years after termination of the Agreement. If our contract terminates with a customer, MNTN does not further collect or use any information received from the customer.
