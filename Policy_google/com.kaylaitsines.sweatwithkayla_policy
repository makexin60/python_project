You may choose to connect a third-party device (like an Apple Watch or fitness tracker) to the Platform and enable that device to share your fitness activity or health information (e.g., heart rate, steps, water intake) it collects with Sweat. Sweat also shares that data back to Apple and Google. You can manage what data your device shares with Sweat (and what information Sweat shares with your device) at any time within the Apple Health or Google Fit application on your device.
To learn more about how you can manage what data your Apple device shares with and receives from Sweat, please refer to this

Why and how do we use your Personal Data?
Your Personal Data is used for the following purposes:

We may also perform data analysis based on the data we collect from you for statistical and marketing analysis purposes – for example, we may use information about how users of our Platform search for and find specific workouts to better understand the best ways to organise and present the content that we offer. We use third-party analytics providers to gain deeper insights into how you use our Services.
if you choose to post in the Forum, the information that you share will be public information that can be accessed by anyone whether or not they are a part of the Sweat community. As the information posted to the Forum is public information, it will also be indexed and accessible via third party internet search engines, websites and apps.

Forum Community Guidelines
.
Communicate information about our products and services and for other targeted promotional purposes:
With your consent, or as otherwise permitted by applicable Data Protection Law, we will use your Personal Data to provide information that we believe is of interest to you, prior to, during, and after your interactions with us, including marketing communications and news concerning our products, services, events and other promotions. We use cookies, pixels and other similar tracing technologies to provide us with analytics, provide measurement, and for ad targeting. These tracking technologies may be set by us or our third party partners such as TikTok, Meta, Google, Snap.
You can opt-out at any time after you have given your consent to such communications.

From time to time, we may also conduct customer surveys to gauge satisfaction with our Platform and the services and products that we provide. If you voluntarily complete a survey, we will collect and analyse your responses to improve our Services and Platform.
Administrative or legal purposes:
We use your Personal Data to operate our business, including for statistical and marketing analysis, systems testing and to diagnose technical and service problems, maintenance, and development of our Platform, or in order to deal with a dispute or claim.

We may also use your Personal Data in other ways, and where we do so, we will provide specific notice at the time of collection and obtain your consent unless otherwise permitted by applicable Data Protection Law.
5.
What legal bases do we have for processing your Personal Data?
In some countries, such as the European Economic Area and United Kingdom, we need to have a legal basis to process your Personal Data. Our processing of your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice is done pursuant to the following legal basis:
As necessary to comply with or fulfill our legal obligations. For example, we need to collect your date of birth to ensure you are old enough to use the Platform.
The processing is necessary for the performance of our contract with you, such as providing you with our services on the Platform. Where we receive your Personal Data as part of providing our Services to you based on a contract, we require such Personal Data to be able to carry out the contract. Without that necessary Personal Data, we will not be able to provide our services to you;
If it is in our legitimate interests to do so as a business. For example, to improve the functionality of our Platform or conduct system testing and to diagnose technical and service problems, maintenance, and development of our Platform;
Where you have consented to our using your Personal Data.  For example, for the collection of data pertaining to your health status or for direct marketing;
Where you have made such information is manifestly made public; and
To protect your vital interests or those of another person (e.g. in case of a medical emergency).
Special Category Data or Sensitive Data
Personal details including about your physical or mental health are considered “sensitive” Personal Data under applicable Data Protection Law. We will process any such data only if you have given your explicit consent, or it is necessary (for instance, if you request special assistance), or if the sensitive Personal Data has been manifestly made public by you (e.g., by posting information about your health/fitness status in the Forum), or otherwise in compliance with applicable Data Protection Law.
You may withdraw your consent for Sweat’s processing of your sensitive Personal Data in the Profile Menu in the App at any time. To manage what data your Linked Device shares with Sweat, please refer to the instructions in Section 3 above. As described more fully below, you may always contact us with any questions or requests about your Personal Data.
6.
How do we protect and manage your Personal Data
Security
We follow strict security procedures in the collection, storage, and disclosure of your Personal Data, which are designed to protect it against misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure and accidental loss, destruction or damage. The data you provide to us is protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. SSL is the industry standard method of encrypting Personal Data and credit card details so that they can be securely transferred over the internet. We use industry-standard encryption algorithms when we store your data in our systems.
Retention of your Personal Data
We will not retain your Personal Data for longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is being processed. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the purposes for which we process it, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
We also consider the periods for which we might need to retain Personal Data in order to meet our legal obligations, or to deal with complaints and queries, and to protect our legal rights in the event of a claim being made.
In general, this means that we will likely keep your Personal Data for as long as your User Account is open. Following deletion of your User Account, however, we may still retain a limited portion of your Personal Data so that we can maintain a continuous relationship with you if and when we are in contact with you again, and to comply with our internal processes and any legal obligations.
When we no longer need your Personal Data, we will securely delete or destroy it. We may also fully anonymise your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use that information without further notice to you.
Information that you have shared in the Forum will remain public even after you have closed your Forum account. When you choose to delete content that you have posted to the Forum, the information will not be deleted from third party websites, apps or internet search engine indexes instantly as removal of the content depends on third party policies.
7.
Where do we store and transfer your Personal Data?
Sweat is headquartered in Australia but operates its business in multiple countries around the world.
The Personal Data that Sweat collects from you will be processed and stored in Australia, the United States of America, and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Sweat will share your Personal Data with its service providers (e.g., customer support providers such as Zendesk, digital advertising providers such as Google and Meta), partners, and affiliates to help provide the services to you. Therefore, the Personal Data that you provide to Sweat may be transferred to countries other than the country in which you initially provided your Personal Data or where Sweat is located. Sweat takes measures to ensure the protection of your Personal Data by its service providers.
If you are a user in the EEA or UK:
While countries outside the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom do not always have strong privacy and data protection laws, we take measures to protect your Personal Data in compliance with applicable Data Protection Law. We require all third-party data recipients (including our service providers and partners) to process your information in a secure manner and in accordance with the Data Protection Law (e.g., through the signing of the appropriate data processing agreements and EU Standard Contractual Clauses). If you have further questions about this or would like to request copies of the applicable safeguards, please contact us.

Third party social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snap, Google in various circumstances, including where:
you are able to access third party social media services through our Platform or before coming to our Platform;

you post or otherwise participate in competitions, events, or direct your social media posts to us via a hashtag, tag, link, etc.; and

Please refer to the privacy policy of those third-party social media platforms to find out more about these practices.

Information posted in the Forum will be indexed to third party internet search engines (such as Google), websites and apps. For further information about how information that is posted in the Forum is used, please refer to our
Forum Community Guidelines
.
Where you choose to link a third-party wearable device (like an Apple Watch), workout completion and other information may be transferred back to the wearable in order for you to track fitness progress using that device. You can manage this data transfer in the settings panel of your wearable’s app, as discussed above.
We may also transfer your Personal Data to potential buyers in the event that we sell or transfer all or a part of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization or dissolution / liquidation), under strict non-disclosure restrictions, and solely in order to allow a buyer to determine whether to proceed with the transaction, or where such a determination is made, to complete it.

Your Privacy Rights and Choices
You may have the right to:
Transparency
You have the right to request information about whether we hold Personal Data about you, and, if so, what that information is and why we are holding/using it.
Access
You may request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Correction
You have the right to request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Erasure
You can request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing.
Object
You may object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling
You may also object to automated decision-making including profiling, that is not to be subject to any automated decision-making by us using your Personal Data or profiling of you.
Restriction of Processing
You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Transfer
Request transfer of your Personal Data in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically usable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically usable format.
Withdraw Consent
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your Personal Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time by contacting us. You can also withdraw your consent for the processing of your health information within the Profile Menu of the App. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes to which you originally agreed, unless we have another proper and legitimate basis for doing so.
Complain
You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of your Personal Data with the body regulating data protection in the country or state / province in which you live. If the GDPR applies to our processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you are not satisfied with how we process your Personal Data. Specifically, you can lodge a complaint in the Member State of the European Union of your habitual residence, place of work, or of the alleged violation of the GDPR.
How to Exercise Your Rights?
If you wish to exercise your rights related to your Personal Data (including the rights set out above), please contact the Sweat team using the contact information at the end of this notice or via customer support on the Platform..
While you will generally not be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data or to exercise any of your other statutory rights, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly completely unfounded, excessive or declines to comply with such requests where permitted by applicable Data Protection Law.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it and to prevent unauthorised modification of your Personal Data.

https://join.sweat.com/en/do-not-sell-my-information

If we cannot satisfy your request, we will also explain why in our response.
Authorised Agent
You may appoint an authorised agent to exercise any of your privacy rights on your behalf.
To appoint an authorised agent, you must also sign a written declaration giving the authorised agent permission to act on your behalf, or you can appoint such agent via a power of attorney.
To verify that your authorised agent acts on your behalf, we will ask for this written permission from your agent or for the power of attorney. In case you provided your authorised agent with a written permission, we will require that you also verify your identity and we may also ask you to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorised agent permission to submit the request.

Sweat also shares that data back to Apple and Google.

We may also use your Personal Data in other ways, and where we do so, we will provide specific notice at the time of collection and obtain your consent unless otherwise permitted by applicable Data Protection Law.
5.
What legal bases do we have for processing your Personal Data?
In some countries, such as the European Economic Area and United Kingdom, we need to have a legal basis to process your Personal Data. Our processing of your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice is done pursuant to the following legal basis:
As necessary to comply with or fulfill our legal obligations. For example, we need to collect your date of birth to ensure you are old enough to use the Platform.
The processing is necessary for the performance of our contract with you, such as providing you with our services on the Platform. Where we receive your Personal Data as part of providing our Services to you based on a contract, we require such Personal Data to be able to carry out the contract. Without that necessary Personal Data, we will not be able to provide our services to you;
If it is in our legitimate interests to do so as a business. For example, to improve the functionality of our Platform or conduct system testing and to diagnose technical and service problems, maintenance, and development of our Platform;
Where you have consented to our using your Personal Data.  For example, for the collection of data pertaining to your health status or for direct marketing;
Where you have made such information is manifestly made public; and
To protect your vital interests or those of another person (e.g. in case of a medical emergency).
Special Category Data or Sensitive Data
Personal details including about your physical or mental health are considered “sensitive” Personal Data under applicable Data Protection Law. We will process any such data only if you have given your explicit consent, or it is necessary (for instance, if you request special assistance), or if the sensitive Personal Data has been manifestly made public by you (e.g., by posting information about your health/fitness status in the Forum), or otherwise in compliance with applicable Data Protection Law.
You may withdraw your consent for Sweat’s processing of your sensitive Personal Data in the Profile Menu in the App at any time. To manage what data your Linked Device shares with Sweat, please refer to the instructions in Section 3 above. As described more fully below, you may always contact us with any questions or requests about your Personal Data.
6.
How do we protect and manage your Personal Data
Security
We follow strict security procedures in the collection, storage, and disclosure of your Personal Data, which are designed to protect it against misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure and accidental loss, destruction or damage. The data you provide to us is protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. SSL is the industry standard method of encrypting Personal Data and credit card details so that they can be securely transferred over the internet. We use industry-standard encryption algorithms when we store your data in our systems.
Retention of your Personal Data
We will not retain your Personal Data for longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is being processed. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the purposes for which we process it, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
We also consider the periods for which we might need to retain Personal Data in order to meet our legal obligations, or to deal with complaints and queries, and to protect our legal rights in the event of a claim being made.
In general, this means that we will likely keep your Personal Data for as long as your User Account is open. Following deletion of your User Account, however, we may still retain a limited portion of your Personal Data so that we can maintain a continuous relationship with you if and when we are in contact with you again, and to comply with our internal processes and any legal obligations.
When we no longer need your Personal Data, we will securely delete or destroy it. We may also fully anonymise your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use that information without further notice to you.
Information that you have shared in the Forum will remain public even after you have closed your Forum account. When you choose to delete content that you have posted to the Forum, the information will not be deleted from third party websites, apps or internet search engine indexes instantly as removal of the content depends on third party policies.
7.
Where do we store and transfer your Personal Data?
Sweat is headquartered in Australia but operates its business in multiple countries around the world.
The Personal Data that Sweat collects from you will be processed and stored in Australia, the United States of America, and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Sweat will share your Personal Data with its service providers (e.g., customer support providers such as Zendesk, digital advertising providers such as Google and Meta), partners, and affiliates to help provide the services to you. Therefore, the Personal Data that you provide to Sweat may be transferred to countries other than the country in which you initially provided your Personal Data or where Sweat is located. Sweat takes measures to ensure the protection of your Personal Data by its service providers.
If you are a user in the EEA or UK:
While countries outside the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom do not always have strong privacy and data protection laws, we take measures to protect your Personal Data in compliance with applicable Data Protection Law. We require all third-party data recipients (including our service providers and partners) to process your information in a secure manner and in accordance with the Data Protection Law (e.g., through the signing of the appropriate data processing agreements and EU Standard Contractual Clauses). If you have further questions about this or would like to request copies of the applicable safeguards, please contact us.

Forum Community Guidelines

We may also transfer your Personal Data to potential buyers in the event that we sell or transfer all or a part of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization or dissolution / liquidation), under strict non-disclosure restrictions, and solely in order to allow a buyer to determine whether to proceed with the transaction, or where such a determination is made, to complete it.

You may request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Correction
You have the right to request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Erasure
You can request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing.
Object
You may object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling
You may also object to automated decision-making including profiling, that is not to be subject to any automated decision-making by us using your Personal Data or profiling of you.
Restriction of Processing
You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Transfer
Request transfer of your Personal Data in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically usable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically usable format.
Withdraw Consent
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your Personal Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time by contacting us. You can also withdraw your consent for the processing of your health information within the Profile Menu of the App. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes to which you originally agreed, unless we have another proper and legitimate basis for doing so.
Complain
You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of your Personal Data with the body regulating data protection in the country or state / province in which you live. If the GDPR applies to our processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you are not satisfied with how we process your Personal Data. Specifically, you can lodge a complaint in the Member State of the European Union of your habitual residence, place of work, or of the alleged violation of the GDPR.
How to Exercise Your Rights?
If you wish to exercise your rights related to your Personal Data (including the rights set out above), please contact the Sweat team using the contact information at the end of this notice or via customer support on the Platform..
While you will generally not be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data or to exercise any of your other statutory rights, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly completely unfounded, excessive or declines to comply with such requests where permitted by applicable Data Protection Law.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it and to prevent unauthorised modification of your Personal Data.

Making Personal Data (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a "sale" or “share” under applicable U.S. State Consumer Privacy Laws. There are also instances where Sweat could be considered to be “selling” Personal Data under these laws, such as when Sweat engages in partnerships with other organisations to offer discounts for each other’s products and services to our users.

However, Sweat may provide information about you to third party advertising partners (like Meta), and this may constitute a “sale” under applicable U.S. State Consumer Privacy Laws.  To exercise the right to opt-out of this kind of information transfer, you (or your authorised agent) may submit a request to us by completing the webform at this link
https://join.sweat.com/en/do-not-sell-my-information

If we cannot satisfy your request, we will also explain why in our response.
Authorised Agent
You may appoint an authorised agent to exercise any of your privacy rights on your behalf.
To appoint an authorised agent, you must also sign a written declaration giving the authorised agent permission to act on your behalf, or you can appoint such agent via a power of attorney.
To verify that your authorised agent acts on your behalf, we will ask for this written permission from your agent or for the power of attorney. In case you provided your authorised agent with a written permission, we will require that you also verify your identity and we may also ask you to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorised agent permission to submit the request.

Note: We can only handle inquiries related to foreign organizations that have actually appointed VeraSafe to act as their Data Protection Representative. We have no way to prevent an organization from falsely claiming that VeraSafe is their Data Protection Representative.
Provide a Detailed Description of Your Inquiry
*
Your First Name

We will process your personal data as described in our
Privacy Policy
Submit
If you are a human seeing this field, please leave it empty.
A quick summary of how your inquiry will be handled:
As you’re likely aware, the purpose of this form is to help make it easier for you to get in touch with non-EU and/or non-UK organizations that process your personal data. Given that, any data you submit on this form will be transferred to the foreign organization that you identify in the “Name of the organization that your inquiry relates to” field, above, with the aim of helping resolve your concern. Note that you likely won’t hear any response to your inquiry from VeraSafe directly. Unless the foreign organization specifically authorizes us to respond to you directly, the foreign organization will be fully responsible for handling your inquiry on their own, without any involvement from VeraSafe. In our role as a representative working on behalf of foreign organizations, we can facilitate communication between you and the foreign organization but we don’t have any way to resolve your inquiry ourselves. We want to help you, but we have no power to force any foreign organization to respond to your inquiry, even if we (you and us) both think they should.
Since VeraSafe has a legal obligation to relay your inquiry to the foreign organization you identify above, your rights to request that we not use your data for this purpose are quite limited. Likewise, please be aware that we have a legal obligation to document how we handle your inquiries, which may prevent us from erasing your personal data upon your request. If you do not want VeraSafe to process your personal data, you must not submit such personal data to us in any way. You can always direct your concern to the foreign organization directly (instead of VeraSafe), and you have no obligation to send your inquiry to VeraSafe.
Examples of inquiries that are not likely to be accepted using this form:
Customer service issues
Inquiries that don’t provide enough information or context
Complaints that involve any threats, abusive language, or delivering legal notices
Requests for legal advice
Issues un-related to data protection
Inquiries directed to organizations that have not appointed any VeraSafe entity or affiliate as their Data Protection Representative
Examples of inquiries that are likely to be accepted using this form:
Substantive privacy concerns
Inquiries from regulatory agencies
Requests to exercise privacy rights
