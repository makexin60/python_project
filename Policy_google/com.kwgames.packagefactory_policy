3. Who May Access Your Personal Data
In addition to Kwai Games and/or its affiliates, other parties may also access your personal data in the following situations. You or your parents acknowledge and agree that you or your parents have foreseen and agreed to such disclosure when you provide your personal data.
(1) Competent Authorities
We may provide certain portion of your personal data to judicial or administrative authorities as so requested. Besides, we may disclose certain portion of your personal data within a strictly limited scope of recipients for example our users or a specific segment of the public when we reasonably think it is necessary to protect us or other people.
In addition, as required by applicable laws, we reserve the right to disclose your personal data in the cases that we, in our good faith, believe that disclosing such data is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you, for example, if (a) you are violating any agreements between us, such as the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy or otherwise damage us, and the disclosure of this information is necessary to resolve these disputes through judicial process; (b) you are infringing third parties’ rights and interests (including but not limited to intellectual property rights); and/or (c) we believe that it is necessary to prevent fraud, crimes or other illegal activities.

Kwai Games works with a number of (if any) social media contractors, advertising services contractors, data analyzing contractors, payment contractors, fraud-detection contractors and other third-party contractors on or through our services. We do not sell your personal data and only share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and public data with third parties.
Besides, such contractors may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other tracking technologies to collect or receive data about you and might claim controller rights over your personal data. For example, users purchasing products or services will be required to provide additional data to third party payment contractors, such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, etc. Such third-party payment contractors may collect, process, retain your data to process payments and resolve subsequent payment disputes and inquiries. We may also receive, process and store the provided information from you and/or such third-party payment contractors to confirm payment, record purchase history and/or protect our legitimate interest when resolving subsequent payment disputes and inquiries.
Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy policy as we do.

5. International Data Transfers
As Kwai Games is a global network with our subsidiaries and affiliates located around the world, your personal data may be transferred to and stored outside the country or region where you are located. Kwai Games, our subsidiaries and affiliates may use servers and other resources in various countries and territories to process your information.

We may transfer your personal data to a third party that acquires all or substantially all of us or our business.

If you are visiting the Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that your personal data is transferred to USA or Singapore. USA and Singapore do not have the same data protection laws as the EU and will not afford many of the rights conferred upon data subjects in the EU.
