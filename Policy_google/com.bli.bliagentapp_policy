The protection of personal information is an integral part of doing business at The Pragati Life Insurance Limited .

What is personal information?
"Personal information" means any factual or subjective information concerning an identifiable individual. Personal information may be collected concerning a variety of individuals with whom our company does business, including from group and individual life insured, beneficiaries, employees, contractors and brokers.
Personal information can be collected in a variety of forms, including written (such as correspondence and memoranda) as well as electronic communications and records, video or audio recordings and photographs.
Examples of personal information include information concerning an individual's name, age, sex, health, personal characteristics or personal and financial circumstances. Personal information can also include such things as identification numbers (such as SIN or employee numbers), banking and income information, employment records, credit records and medical information.
Personal information does not include the name, title or business address, telephone number or e-mail address of employees of an organization.

Principle 1:
Accountability
Pragati Life Insurance Limited is responsible for personal information under its control and has designated an individual or individuals who are accountable for compliance with this policy.
.
Pragati Life Insurance Limited, its employees and contractors are responsible for all personal information in their possession or control, including information that has been obtained from or transferred to a third party for processing.
A Privacy Officer has been designated as accountable for adherence by Pragati Life Insurance Limited to this policy and applicable privacy statutes, regulations and guidelines. Where appropriate, the responsibilities of the Privacy Officer may be delegated to an individual or individuals within a particular business area familiar with the nature of the personal information collected within the area and any special needs the area may have concerning the protection of personal information.
Principle 2:
Identifying Purposes
Pragati Life Insurance Limited will identify the purposes for which personal information is being collected before or at the time that the information is collected.
Pragati Life Insurance Limited collects personal information in a number of ways. For example, information may be collected on an application or claim form, during a personal interview or through other means. Prior to or at the time of collection, Pragati Life Insurance Limited will identify the purpose of collection. This may be communicated in writing or orally, depending upon the manner in which the information is collected.
Persons collecting personal information are expected to be able to explain to individuals the purposes for which the information is being collected.
Pragati Life Insurance Limited will not collect, use, or disclose information beyond that required to fulfill the purposes specified at the time of collection.
Unless the new purpose is required by law, before using personal information for a purpose not previously identified, the company will identify the new purpose and obtain the consent of the individual to its use.
Principle 3:
Consent
Pragati Life Insurance Limited must obtain the knowledge and consent of the individual to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.
Usually, Pragati Life Insurance Limited will obtain consent for the use or disclosure of personal information at the time of collection. Sometimes, consent will be obtained after the information has been collected but prior to use (for example, when the company wishes to use information for a purpose not previously identified).
Pragati Life Insurance Limited may seek consent in a variety of ways, depending on the circumstances and the type of information collected. The company will generally seek express consent when the personal information is likely to be considered sensitive (such as medical or income records).
Sometimes consent may be obtained from an authorized representative, such as a legal guardian or person holding a power of attorney.
Implied consent may be inferred in circumstances where the information is less sensitive and consent to collection, use or disclosure can be reasonably inferred.
In certain limited circumstances, personal information can be collected, used, or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud or for law enforcement purposes, seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when the individual is a minor, seriously ill, or otherwise incapacitated.
An individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Pragati Life Insurance Limited will inform the individual of the implications of such withdrawal, which may include termination of a policy, termination of benefits or inability to process a claim.
Principle 4:
Limiting Collection
The collection of personal information will be limited to that which is reasonably necessary for the purposes identified by Pragati Life Insurance Limited. Information shall be collected only by fair and lawful means.
The company will not collect personal information indiscriminately. Both the amount and the type of information collected shall be limited to that which is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes identified.
Information will be collected in a manner that complies with the company's obligations to identify the purpose of collection and to obtain the consent of the individual to collection, use and disclosure of personal information.
Principle 5:
Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention
Pragati Life Insurance Limited will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or in accordance with the exceptions set out above. Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes
.
Personal information that has been used to make a decision about an individual will be retained long enough to allow the individual access to the information after the decision has been made.
Personal information that is no longer required to fulfil its purpose shall be destroyed in accordance with Pragati Life Insurance Limited record retention and destruction policies and procedures.
Principle 6:
Accuracy
Personal information will be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.
The extent to which personal information shall be updated will depend upon the use of the information, taking into account the interests of the individual. Information will be sufficiently accurate, complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate information may be used to make a decision about the individual.
Pragati Life Insurance Limited will not routinely update personal information, unless such a process is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected.
Principle 7:
Safeguards
Personal information will be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
Pragati Life Insurance Limited has implemented security safeguards and appropriate training to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
Security safeguards vary depending on the nature and format of the information collected. The methods of protection include physical, organizational and technological measures designed to limit access to authorized persons, ensure the integrity of the information and protect it from unauthorized use or disclosure.
Security safeguards also include steps to ensure that all third parties with whom we contract and who may be required to handle personal information have implemented comparable security measures.
Principle 8:
Openness

.
Upon request, Pragati Life Insurance Limited will inform an individual whether or not it holds personal information about the individual, will permit the individual to access the information and provide an account of the use made of the information, including any disclosure to third parties. Pragati Life Insurance Limited may choose to make sensitive medical information available through a medical practitioner designated by the individual.
In certain situations, Pragati Life Insurance Limited may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information is holds about an individual.
