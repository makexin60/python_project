A Társaság csak azokat a pedagógusi, diák, gondviselői, felhasználói adatokat továbbítja, amelyeket jogszabály rendel el. Az adatok
            továbbíthatók a bíróság, rendőrség, ügyészség, önkormányzat, államigazgatási szerv, nemzetbiztonsági szolgálat
            részére.
VII. Az adatkezelés technikai lebonyolítása
VII.1. Az adatkezelés általános módszerei
A Társaságnál kezelt adatok nyilvántartási módja a következő lehet:
nyomtatott irat,
elektronikus adat,
elektronikusan létrehozott, de papír alapon archivált adat,
a Társaság weblapján elhelyezett elektronikus adat.
Az adatkezelő lapok hagyományos nyomtatott formában vagy számítógépes módszerrel is vezethetők.
VIII. A Társaság honlapja
A Társaság honlapjait, alkalmazásait és szolgáltatásait általában bárki ingyenesen és anélkül látogathatja, hogy
            önmagáról bármilyen személyes adatot meg kellene adnia. A honlapok, alkalmazások, szolgáltatások egyes részei regisztráció nélkül
            látogathatók, és az ott elérhető szolgáltatások ingyenesen igénybe vehetők. A honlapok, alkalmazások, illetve szolgáltatások meghatározott
            részeihez való hozzáférés azonban regisztrációhoz kötött.
A regisztráció során - önkéntesen, jogszabályi kötelezettség nélkül - személyes adatnak minősülő információkat is
            szükséges megadni.
A Társaság, mint adatkezelő, a Rendelet és az Infotv. előírásait maradéktalanul betartva kezeli és tartja nyilván az érintett adatait. A
            Társaság csak azokat az adatokat kezeli, amelyekre vonatkozóan jogszerű jogalappal rendelkezik.
A Társaság a regisztráció illetve honlapjai, alkalmazásai vagy szolgáltatásai használata során tudomására jutott személyes adatot
                biztonságosan tárolja, azt semmilyen körülmények között nem teszi - az érintett előzetes, kifejezett jóváhagyó hozzájárulása
                nélkül - harmadik személy számára hozzáférhetővé, kivéve, ha jogszabály ezt kötelezővé teszi.
Amennyiben az érintett személyes adatot nem kíván megadni, úgy ne regisztráljon.
Az érintett bármikor tájékoztatást kérhet személyes adatai kezeléséről, illetve kérheti annak helyesbítését, illetve
            törlését.
A honlap, alkalmazás, vagy szolgáltatás rögzíti az érintett számítógépének internet címét (IP-cím), azt, hogy mikor, milyen
            tartalmat nézett meg a honlapon, alkalmazásban vagy szolgáltatásban, mely linkről navigált a honlapra, szolgáltatásra. Hozzájárulása esetén
            statisztikai eljárással egyéni profilt hozunk létre a felhasználó számára a felhasználói élmény növelése érdekében
            valamint hogy személyre szabottabb szolgáltatással és ajánlatokkal szolgálhassunk. A Társaság ezen statisztikai adatok elemzése alapján ismeri meg, hogy mely
            szolgáltatást, tartalmat milyen gyakran vesznek igénybe és alkalmanként mennyi időt töltenek ott.
Az internet címek kizárólag statisztikai célokat szolgálnak, a Társaság azokat személyes adathoz nem köti.
A Társaság a honlapjait, az azon futó szolgáltatásokat, valamint egyéb digitális termékeit (pl: mozaBook, mozaik3D app, mozaBook app) használó
            felhasználóknak az alkalmazások használatával kapcsolatos szokásairól az alábbi használati adatokat gyűjti:
olvasási, tartalomfogyasztási szokások (mit, mikor, mennyit)
az alkalmazás hibajelzései, összeomlások,
alkalmazás használati szokások (milyen funkciók vannak használatban, milyen eszközön fut az alkalmazás)
IX. Telefonos alkalmazás
A Társaság üzemeltet több mobil alkalmazást (pl.: mozaBook app, mozaik3D viewer, CadaVR app stb.) amelynek segítségével a felhasználók telefonjaikon vagy
            táblagépeiken keresztül a Társaság kínálatában böngészhetnek, elektronikus tartalmakat fogyaszthatnak, illetve digitális könyveket olvashatnak.
A Társaság az alkalmazást futtató felhasználóknak az alkalmazás használatával kapcsolatos szokásairól az alábbi használati adatokat
            gyűjti:
olvasási, tartalomfogyasztási szokások (mit, mikor, mennyit)
az alkalmazás hibajelzései, összeomlások,
alkalmazás használati szokások (milyen funkciók vannak használatban, milyen eszközön fut az alkalmazás)
készülék lokációs adatai
A rendszer működtetése során technikailag rögzítésre kerülő adatok: a felhasználó bejelentkező számítógépének azon
            adatai, melyek a szolgáltatás igénybe vétele során generálódnak, és melyeket az adatkezelő rendszere a technikai folyamatok automatikus eredményeként
            rögzít. Az automatikusan rögzítésre kerülő adatokat a rendszer a felhasználó külön nyilatkozata vagy cselekménye nélkül a
            belépéskor, illetve kilépéskor automatikusan naplózza. Ezen adatok egyéb felhasználói személyes adatokkal - törvény által
            kötelezővé tett esetek kivételével - össze nem kapcsolhatók. Az adatokhoz kizárólag az adatkezelő fér hozzá.
A használati adatok az alkalmazást futtató felhasználók személyes adataival semmilyen esetben sem kerülnek összekapcsolásra.

            anélkül, hogy ezt akadályozná az az Adatkezelő, amelynek a személyes adatokat a rendelkezésére bocsátotta. A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 20. cikke
            tartalmazza.
X. 8. A tiltakozáshoz való jog
Az érintett jogosult arra, hogy a saját helyzetével kapcsolatos okokból bármikor tiltakozzon személyes adatainak közérdeken, közfeladat

            is. Ebben az esetben az adatkezelő a személyes adatokat nem kezelheti tovább, kivéve, ha az adatkezelő bizonyítja, hogy az adatkezelést olyan kényszerítő erejű
            jogos okok indokolják, amelyek elsőbbséget élveznek az érintett érdekeivel, jogaival és szabadságaival szemben, vagy amelyek jogi igények
            előterjesztéséhez, érvényesítéséhez vagy védelméhez kapcsolódnak. A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 21. cikke tartalmazza.
X. 9. Automatizált döntéshozatal egyedi ügyekben, beleértve a profilalkotást
Az érintett jogosult arra, hogy ne terjedjen ki rá az olyan, kizárólag automatizált adatkezelésen - ideértve a profilalkotást is - alapuló

            pontosságát. Ebben az esetben a korlátozás arra az időtartamra vonatkozik, amely lehetővé teszi, hogy a Társaság ellenőrizze a személyes adatok
            pontosságát. A társaság megjelöli az általa kezelt személyes adatot, amennyiben az érintett vitatja annak helyességét vagy pontosságát, de a
            vitatott személyes adat helytelensége vagy pontatlansága nem állapítható meg egyértelműen. Az érintett kérheti, hogy személyes adatainak
            kezelését a Társaság korlátozza akkor is, ha az adatkezelés jogellenes, de az érintett ellenzi a kezelt személyes adatok törlését, és ehelyett
            kéri azok felhasználásának korlátozását. Az érintett továbbá akkor is kérheti, hogy személyes adatainak kezelését a
            Társaság korlátozza, ha az adatkezelés célja megvalósult, de az érintett igényli azok Társaság általi kezelését jogi igények

            feltételezett jogsértés helye szerinti tagállamban -, ha az érintett megítélése szerint a rá vonatkozó személyes adatok kezelése
            megsérti a Rendeletet. A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 77. cikke tartalmazza.

XI. Az érintett kérelmének előterjesztése, az adatkezelő intézkedései
(1) Az Adatkezelő indokolatlan késedelem nélkül, de legkésőbb a kérelem beérkezésétől számított egy hónapon belül
            tájékoztatja az érintettet a jogai gyakorlására irányuló kérelme nyomán hozott intézkedésekről.
(2) Szükség esetén, figyelembe véve a kérelem összetettségét és a kérelmek számát, ez a határidő további két
            hónappal meghosszabbítható. A határidő meghosszabbításáról az Adatkezelő a késedelem okainak megjelölésével a kérelem
            kézhezvételétől számított egy hónapon belül tájékoztatja az érintettet.
(3) Ha az érintett elektronikus úton nyújtotta be a kérelmet, a tájékoztatást lehetőség szerint elektronikus úton kell megadni, kivéve, ha az
            érintett azt másként kéri.
(4) Ha az Adatkezelő nem tesz intézkedéseket az érintett kérelme nyomán, késedelem nélkül, de legkésőbb a kérelem
            beérkezésétől számított egy hónapon belül tájékoztatja az érintettet az intézkedés elmaradásának okairól, valamint
            arról, hogy az érintett panaszt nyújthat be valamely felügyeleti hatóságnál [Nemzeti Adatvédelmi és Információszabadság Hatóság,
            1125 Budapest, Szilágyi Erzsébet fasor 22/C.; telefonszám: +36-1+391-1400; telefax: +36-1-391-1410;
e-mail:
[Mutasd]
], és élhet bírósági jogorvoslati
            jogával.
(5) Az Adatkezelő a Rendelet 13. és 14. cikk szerinti információkat és az érintett jogairól szóló tájékoztatást (Rendelet 15-22. és 34.
            cikk) és intézkedést díjmentesen biztosítja. Ha az érintett kérelme egyértelműen megalapozatlan vagy - különösen ismétlődő
            jellege miatt - túlzó, az Adatkezelő, figyelemmel a kért információ vagy tájékoztatás nyújtásával vagy a kért
            intézkedés meghozatalával járó adminisztratív költségekre:
a) díjat számíthat fel, vagy
b) megtagadhatja a kérelem alapján történő intézkedést.
A kérelem egyértelműen megalapozatlan vagy túlzó jellegének bizonyítása az Adatkezelőt terheli.
(6) Ha az Adatkezelőnek megalapozott kétségei vannak a kérelmet benyújtó természetes személy kilétével kapcsolatban, további, az érintett
            személyazonosságának megerősítéséhez szükséges információk nyújtását kérheti.

nyomtatott irat,
elektronikus adat,
elektronikusan létrehozott, de papír alapon archivált adat,
a Társaság weblapján elhelyezett elektronikus adat.
Az adatkezelő lapok hagyományos nyomtatott formában vagy számítógépes módszerrel is vezethetők.
VIII. A Társaság honlapjai
A Társaság honlapjait általában bárki ingyenesen és anélkül látogathatja, hogy önmagáról bármilyen személyes adatot meg kellene adnia. A honlap egyes részei regisztráció nélkül látogathatók, és az ott elérhető szolgáltatások ingyenesen igénybe vehetők. A honlap meghatározott részeihez való hozzáférés azonban regisztrációhoz kötött.
A regisztráció során – önkéntesen, jogszabályi kötelezettség nélkül – személyes adatnak minősülő információkat is szükséges megadni.
A Társaság, mint adatkezelő, a Rendelet és az Infotv. előírásait maradéktalanul betartva kezeli és tartja nyilván az érintett adatait. A Társaság csak azokat az adatokat kezeli, amelyekre vonatkozóan jogszerű jogalappal rendelkezik.
A Társaság a regisztráció illetve honlapjai vagy alkalmazásai használata során tudomására jutott személyes adatot biztonságosan tárolja, azt semmilyen körülmények között nem teszi - az érintett előzetes, kifejezett jóváhagyó hozzájárulása nélkül - harmadik személy számára hozzáférhetővé, kivéve, ha jogszabály ezt kötelezővé teszi.
Amennyiben az érintett személyes adatot nem kíván megadni, úgy ne regisztráljon.
Az érintett bármikor tájékoztatást kérhet személyes adatai kezeléséről, illetve kérheti annak helyesbítését, illetve törlését.
A honlap rögzíti az érintett számítógépének internet címét (IP-cím), azt, hogy mikor, milyen tartalmat nézett meg a honlapon, mely linkről navigált a honlapra. Hozzájárulása esetén statisztikai eljárással egyéni profilt hozunk létre a felhasználó számára a felhasználói élmény növelése érdekében  valamint hogy személyre szabottabb szolgáltatással és ajánlatokkal szolgálhassunk. A Társaság ezen statisztikai adatok elemzése alapján ismeri meg, hogy mely szolgáltatást, tartalmat milyen gyakran vesznek igénybe és alkalmanként mennyi időt töltenek ott.
Az internet címek kizárólag statisztikai célokat szolgálnak, a Társaság azokat személyes adathoz nem köti.
A Társaság a honlapjait, az azon futó szolgáltatásokat, valamint egyéb digitális termékeit (pl: mozaBook, mozaik3D app, mozaBook app) használó felhasználóknak az alkalmazások használatával kapcsolatos szokásairól az alábbi használati adatokat gyűjti:
olvasási, tartalomfogyasztási szokások (mit, mikor, mennyit)
az alkalmazás hibajelzései, összeomlások,
alkalmazás használati szokások (milyen funkciók vannak használatban, milyen eszközön fut az alkalmazás)
IX. Telefonos alkalmazás
VII.1 A Társaság üzemeltet több mobil alkalmazást (pl.: mozaBook app, mozaik3D viewer, stb.) amelynek segítségével a felhasználók telefonjaikon vagy táblagépeiken keresztül a Társaság kínálatában böngészhetnek, elektronikus tartalmakat fogyaszthatnak, illetve digitális könyveket olvashatnak.
A Társaság az alkalmazást futtató felhasználóknak az alkalmazás használatával kapcsolatos szokásairól az alábbi használati adatokat gyűjti:
olvasási, tartalomfogyasztási szokások (mit, mikor, mennyit)
az alkalmazás hibajelzései, összeomlások,
alkalmazás használati szokások (milyen funkciók vannak használatban, milyen eszközön fut az alkalmazás)
készülék lokációs adatai
A rendszer működtetése során technikailag rögzítésre kerülő adatok: a felhasználó bejelentkező számítógépének azon adatai, melyek a szolgáltatás igénybe vétele során generálódnak, és melyeket az adatkezelő rendszere a technikai folyamatok automatikus eredményeként rögzít. Az automatikusan rögzítésre kerülő adatokat a rendszer a felhasználó külön nyilatkozata vagy cselekménye nélkül a belépéskor, illetve kilépéskor automatikusan naplózza. Ezen adatok egyéb felhasználói személyes adatokkal - törvény által kötelezővé tett esetek kivételével - össze nem kapcsolhatók. Az adatokhoz kizárólag az adatkezelő fér hozzá.
A használati adatok az alkalmazást futtató felhasználók személyes adataival semmilyen esetben sem kerülnek összekapcsolásra.

A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 17. cikke tartalmazza.
X. 5. Az adatkezelés korlátozásához való jog
Az érintett jogosult arra, hogy kérésére az Adatkezelő korlátozza az adatkezelést ha a rendeltben meghatározott feltételek teljesülnek. A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 18. cikke tartalmazza.
X. 6. A személyes adatok helyesbítéséhez vagy törléséhez, illetve az adatkezelés korlátozásához kapcsolódó értesítési kötelezettség
Az Adatkezelő minden olyan címzettet tájékoztat valamennyi helyesbítésről, törlésről vagy adatkezelés-korlátozásról, akivel, illetve amellyel a személyes adatot közölték, kivéve, ha ez lehetetlennek bizonyul, vagy aránytalanul nagy erőfeszítést igényel. Az érintettet kérésére az Adatkezelő tájékoztatja e címzettekről. A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 19. cikke tartalmazza.
X. 7. Az adathordozhatósághoz való jog
A Rendeletben írt feltételekkel az érintett jogosult arra, hogy a rá vonatkozó, általa egy Adatkezelő rendelkezésére bocsátott személyes adatokat tagolt, széles körben használt, géppel olvasható formátumban megkapja, továbbá jogosult arra, hogy ezeket az adatokat egy másik Adatkezelőnek továbbítsa anélkül, hogy ezt akadályozná az az Adatkezelő, amelynek a személyes adatokat a rendelkezésére bocsátotta.

Ebben az esetben az adatkezelő a személyes adatokat nem kezelheti tovább, kivéve, ha az adatkezelő bizonyítja, hogy az adatkezelést olyan kényszerítő erejű jogos okok indokolják, amelyek elsőbbséget élveznek az érintett érdekeivel, jogaival és szabadságaival szemben, vagy amelyek jogi igények előterjesztéséhez, érvényesítéséhez vagy védelméhez kapcsolódnak.

X. 10. Korlátozások
Az érintett kérheti, hogy személyes adatainak kezelését a Társaság korlátozza, amennyiben az érintett vitatja a kezelt személyes adatok pontosságát. Ebben az esetben a korlátozás arra az időtartamra vonatkozik, amely lehetővé teszi, hogy a Társaság ellenőrizze a személyes adatok pontosságát. A társaság megjelöli az általa kezelt személyes adatot, amennyiben az érintett vitatja annak helyességét vagy pontosságát, de a vitatott személyes adat helytelensége vagy pontatlansága nem állapítható meg egyértelműen. Az érintett kérheti, hogy személyes adatainak kezelését a Társaság korlátozza akkor is, ha az adatkezelés jogellenes, de az érintett ellenzi a kezelt személyes adatok törlését, és ehelyett kéri azok felhasználásának korlátozását. Az érintett továbbá akkor is kérheti, hogy személyes adatainak kezelését a Társaság korlátozza, ha az adatkezelés célja megvalósult, de az érintett igényli azok Társaság általi kezelését jogi igények előterjesztéséhez, érvényesítéséhez vagy védelméhez. A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 23. cikke tartalmazza.
X. 11. Az érintett tájékoztatása az adatvédelmi incidensről

Az érintett jogosult arra, hogy panaszt tegyen egy felügyeleti hatóságnál – különösen a szokásos tartózkodási helye, a munkahelye vagy a feltételezett jogsértés helye szerinti tagállamban –, ha az érintett megítélése szerint a rá vonatkozó személyes adatok kezelése megsérti a Rendeletet. A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 77. cikke tartalmazza.
X. 13. A felügyeleti hatósággal szembeni hatékony bírósági jogorvoslathoz való jog
Minden természetes és jogi személy jogosult a hatékony bírósági jogorvoslatra a felügyeleti hatóság rá vonatkozó, jogilag kötelező erejű döntésével szemben, vagy ha a felügyeleti hatóság nem foglalkozik a panasszal, vagy három hónapon belül nem tájékoztatja az érintettet a benyújtott panasszal kapcsolatos eljárási fejleményekről vagy annak eredményéről. A részletes szabályokat a Rendelet 78. cikke tartalmazza.

(2) Szükség esetén, figyelembe véve a kérelem összetettségét és a kérelmek számát, ez a határidő további két hónappal meghosszabbítható. A határidő meghosszabbításáról az Adatkezelő a késedelem okainak megjelölésével a kérelem kézhezvételétől számított egy hónapon belül tájékoztatja az érintettet.
(3) Ha az érintett elektronikus úton nyújtotta be a kérelmet, a tájékoztatást lehetőség szerint elektronikus úton kell megadni, kivéve, ha az érintett azt másként kéri.
(4) Ha az Adatkezelő nem tesz intézkedéseket az érintett kérelme nyomán, késedelem nélkül, de legkésőbb a kérelem beérkezésétől számított egy hónapon belül tájékoztatja az érintettet az intézkedés elmaradásának okairól, valamint arról, hogy az érintett panaszt nyújthat be valamely felügyeleti hatóságnál [Nemzeti Adatvédelmi és Információszabadság Hatóság, 1125 Budapest, Szilágyi Erzsébet fasor 22/C.; telefonszám: +36-1+391-1400; telefax: +36-1-391-1410; e-mail: ugyfelszolgalat@naih.hu], és élhet bírósági jogorvoslati jogával.

Ha az érintett kérelme egyértelműen megalapozatlan vagy – különösen ismétlődő jellege miatt – túlzó, az Adatkezelő, figyelemmel a kért információ vagy tájékoztatás nyújtásával vagy a kért intézkedés meghozatalával járó adminisztratív költségekre:
a) díjat számíthat fel, vagy
b) megtagadhatja a kérelem alapján történő intézkedést.
A kérelem egyértelműen megalapozatlan vagy túlzó jellegének bizonyítása az Adatkezelőt terheli.
(6) Ha az Adatkezelőnek megalapozott kétségei vannak a kérelmet benyújtó természetes személy kilétével kapcsolatban, további, az érintett személyazonosságának megerősítéséhez szükséges információk nyújtását kérheti.

The new Microsoft Edge
helps you browse, search, shop online, and more. Like all modern browsers, Microsoft Edge lets you collect and store specific data on your device, like cookies, and lets you send information to us, like browsing history, to make the experience as rich, fast, and personal as possible.
Whenever we collect data, we want to make sure it’s the right choice for you. Some people worry about their web browsing history being collected. That’s why we tell you what data is stored on your device or collected by us. We give you choices to control what data gets collected. For more information about privacy in Microsoft Edge, we recommend reviewing our
Privacy Statement
.
What data is collected or stored, and why
Microsoft uses diagnostic data to improve our products and services. We use this data to better understand how our products are performing and where improvements need to be made.
Microsoft Edge collects a set of required diagnostic data to keep Microsoft Edge secure, up to date and performing as expected. Microsoft believes in and practices information collection minimization. We strive to gather only the info we need, and to store it only for as long as it’s needed to provide a service or for analysis. In addition, you can control whether optional diagnostic data associated with your device is shared with Microsoft to solve product issues and help improve Microsoft products and services.
As you use features and services in Microsoft Edge, diagnostic data about how you use those features is sent to Microsoft. Microsoft Edge saves your browsing history—information about websites you visit—on your device. Depending on your settings, this browsing history is sent to Microsoft, which helps us find and fix problems and improve our products and services for all users. You can manage the collection of optional diagnostic data in the browser by selecting

Help improve Microsoft products by sending optional diagnostic data about how you use the browser, websites you visit, and crash reports
. This includes data from testing new experiences. To finish making changes to this setting, restart Microsoft Edge.
Turning this setting on allows this optional diagnostic data to be shared with Microsoft from other applications using Microsoft Edge, such as a video streaming app that hosts the Microsoft Edge web platform to stream the video. The Microsoft Edge web platform will send info about how you use the web platform and sites you visit in the application to Microsoft.  This data collection is determined by your optional diagnostic data setting in Privacy, search, and services settings in Microsoft Edge.
On Windows 10, these settings are determined by your Windows diagnostic setting. To change your diagnostic data setting, select

As of
March 6th 2024,
Microsoft Edge diagnostic data is collected separately from Windows diagnostic data on Windows 10 (version 22H2 and newer) and Windows 11 (version 23H2 and newer) devices in the European Economic Area. For these Windows versions, and on all other platforms, you can change your settings in Microsoft Edge by selecting

, and turn on
Show me search and site suggestions using my typed characters
. As you start to type, the info you enter in the address bar is sent to your default search provider to give you immediate search and website suggestions.
When you use InPrivate browsing or guest mode, Microsoft Edge collects some info about how you use the browser depending on your Windows diagnostic data setting or Microsoft Edge privacy settings, but automatic suggestions are turned off and info about websites you visit is not collected. Microsoft Edge will delete your browsing history, cookies, and site data, as well as passwords, addresses, and form data when you close all InPrivate windows. You can start a new InPrivate session by selecting

Microsoft Edge also has features to help you and your content stay safe online. Windows Defender SmartScreen automatically blocks websites and content downloads that are reported to be malicious. Windows Defender SmartScreen checks the address of the webpage you're visiting against a list of webpage addresses stored on your device that Microsoft believes to be legitimate. Addresses that aren't on your device’s list and the addresses of files you're downloading will be sent to Microsoft and checked against a frequently updated list of webpages and downloads that have been reported to Microsoft as unsafe or suspicious.
To speed up tedious tasks like filling out forms and entering passwords, Microsoft Edge can save info to help. If you choose to use those features, Microsoft Edge stores the info on your device. If you’ve turned on sync for form fill like addresses or passwords, this info will be sent to the Microsoft cloud and stored with your Microsoft account to be synced across all your signed-in versions of Microsoft Edge.

To integrate your browsing experience with other activities you do on your device, Microsoft Edge shares your browsing history with Microsoft Windows through its Indexer. This information is stored locally on the device. It includes URLs, a category in which the URL might be relevant, such as “most visited”, “recently visited”, or “recently closed”, and also a relative frequency or recency within each category. Websites you visit while in InPrivate mode will not be shared. This information is then available to other applications on the device, such as the start menu or taskbar.

To protect some video and music content from being copied, some streaming websites store Digital Rights Management (DRM) data on your device, including a unique identifier (ID) and media licenses. When you go to one of these websites, it retrieves the DRM info to make sure you have permission to use the content.
Microsoft Edge also stores cookies, small files that are put on your device as you browse the web. Many websites use cookies to store info about your preferences and settings, like saving the items in your shopping cart so you don't have to add them each time you visit. Some websites also use cookies to collect info about your online activity to show you interest-based advertising. Microsoft Edge gives you options to clear cookies and block websites from saving cookies in the future.
Microsoft Edge will send Do Not Track requests to websites when the
Send Do Not Track requests
setting is turned on. Websites may still track your activities even when a Do Not Track request is sent, however.
