1.
General
National Retail Solutions, Inc. (“NRS”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information.
This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) sets forth our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information.  We also explain the steps we take to protect your information and how you can limit the collection, use and sharing of your information.
This Policy applies to the following unless otherwise noted:
users of our products and services, including our POS terminals and NRS Pay (collectively, the “NRS Products”);
users and visitors of our websites, including

members of any NRS sponsored loyalty or rewards programs (collectively, the “NRS Reward Programs”);
users of our apps, including the My NRS Store app and the BOSS Local Shopping app (collectively, the “NRS Apps”); and
users of web stores that NRS has created for retailers to sell their store’s products online (collectively, the “NRS Web Stores”).
When we use the term “Services” it collectively refers to the NRS Products, the NRS Websites, the NRS Reward Programs, the NRS Apps, and the NRS Web Stores.  When we refer to NRS or “us,” or “we,” we’re talking about National Retail Solutions, Inc. and, as applicable, its affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and other related entities.
You should also read the terms of service for each Service that you use, which can be found at the applicable NRS Website, NRS App or NRS Web Store.
We may update this Policy from time to time and you should review it periodically for changes.  Any updated Policy will be posted at the NRS Websites, the NRS Apps and in the NRS Web Stores.
This Policy does not apply to any website, product, or service of any third-party companies, advertisers, partners, or service providers, even if the website links to (or is linked from) NRS Websites.  NRS Websites may contain links to other third-party websites not owned, operated, maintained by or related to NRS (“Third-Party Sites”).  Any such hyperlinks are to be accessed at the user’s own risk.  We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, data collection, policies, or any other aspect of a Third-Party Site, even if the NRS Websites contain a link to such site.  This Policy does not apply to Third Party Sites, and we encourage you to independently read and understand each Third-Party Site’s own privacy policies.  The presence of a link to a Third-Party Site does not necessarily indicate that such Third-Party Site is sponsored by or affiliated with NRS in any way.
2.

4.
How We Use Information
We may use all the Personal Information we collect or you provide to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services (and some third party services).  In addition, we may use your information for general, operational and administrative purposes, including maintaining your account, authenticating you and contacting you.  As used in this Policy, the terms “use,” “using” and “processing” information include using cookies or other similar technologies on a computer/phone/device, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including but not limited to, scanning, collecting, storing, evaluating, aggregating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and sharing information among our affiliates both in and outside the United States and to select service providers and vendors.
A. Our Services.  We analyze how our customers use our Services and use that information to evaluate and improve our Services, to research, develop, and test new services and features, and to conduct troubleshooting activities.  For example:
we communicate with you about our Services and features and let you know about our terms and policies and other important updates;
we may target particular advertisements or other content to you based information we have collected or you provided;
we may digitally scan content stored in the NRS Apps, including without limitation, your user information, and use this information to provide you with targeted information and advertising;

we verify accounts and activity, and promote safety and security, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms, to ensure our Services are being used legally.
B. NRS Apps.  We engage certain service providers and vendors who use mobile software development kits to passively collect information from users of the NRS Apps.  We use this data primarily to help us deliver personalized notifications and to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers for the purposes of customizing advertisements or content.
5.
How We Share Information
We may share all the information we collect and receive with our affiliates, both in and outside the United States, and to select service providers and vendors, to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services (and some third party services), and for general, operational and administrative purposes, including maintaining your account, authenticating you and contacting you.  We also share information with each NRS store with which you interact.  When we share information with our service providers and vendors, we require them to use your information only in accordance with our instructions and terms or with express permission from you and not to sell your information.  In addition, you share your information as you use and communicate through our Services.
A. Information Shared Within the NRS Family of Companies.  We may share information within the NRS family of companies, including our affiliates both in and outside the United States (collectively, the “NRS Family of Companies”) primarily to operate, provide, support and market our Services.  For example, we may share your information with various NRS affiliates in order to process your transaction.
B. Information Shared with our Service Providers and Vendors.  We work with various service providers and vendors for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support and market our Services.  We may share information with these service providers and vendors to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform work on our and your behalf.  For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested.  In addition, NRS shares certain information, including unique marketing identifiers, email addresses and mobile phone numbers (full or only partial), with some of our service providers and vendors, including tobacco companies, Google and Facebook, for marketing, advertising, rewards/loyalty programs and analysis purposes, including the delivery of advertising campaigns and preparing and sharing aggregate business and marketing reports, demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about products and services.  All the foregoing categories exclude text messaging originator opt in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.  In addition, no mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes.  When we share information with our service providers and vendors, we request that these parties protect your information and limit their use of the data to the purposes for which it was provided, and not to sell your information.  NRS does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.  NRS does on occasion sell certain pieces of personal information, such as personal identifiers, of some of our stores’ customers to data processors.  Finally, if you purchase products or services offered jointly by NRS and one of our service providers or vendors, your customer information may be received by both NRS and the service provider or vendor that is providing the product or service.  For these jointly offered products and services, you should also review the other company’s privacy policy, which may include practices that are different from the practices described here.
C. Special Circumstances.  We may share information in certain special circumstances.  For example:
to comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders and search warrants, and as otherwise permitted or required by law;
to assist law enforcement in cases involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or in other emergencies;
to protect our rights or property, or the safety of our customers or employees;

with your consent.
D. Information Shared with Advertising Entities or Social Networks.  You may see third party advertisements on our products and Services, the NRS Websites, the NRS Apps, and/or the NRS Web Stores.  Some advertisements are chosen by companies that place advertisements on behalf of advertisers.  These companies, often called ad servers, may place and access cookies on your device to collect information about your visit.  The information they collect from our sites is in a form that does not identify you personally.  This information may be combined with similar data obtained from other websites to help our advertisers better reach their targeted audiences.  Targeting may be accomplished by tailoring advertising to interests that they infer from your browsing of our sites and your interaction with other websites where these ad servers also are present.  If you choose to interact with specific advertisers who advertise on our products and Services, the NRS Websites, the NRS Apps, or the NRS Web Stores, the information you provide to them is subject to the conditions of their specific privacy policies.  The NRS Websites, NRS Apps and NRS Web Stores also include plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or entities about the NRS page you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget.
E. When You Share Information.  You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services.  Stores with whom you communicate may store or share your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services.
6.
Cookies & Other Tracking Technology
Our Services may use “cookies,” web beacons, and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to automatically collect users’ information (including Personal Information).  Cookies are small data files that are transferred to users’ web browsers and/or stored on their devices as they are browsing.  We may use Cookies to improve our Services and make your user experience online more customized and efficient.  Among other uses, Cookies help us recognize repeat users, facilitate users’ access to and use of NRS Websites, and track users’ behavior on websites they visit.  We may compile aggregate data for statistical purposes to improve the content of our Sites or to better administer the web pages available on the Sites.
Web beacons are used to tell us how and when pages in our sites are visited, by how many people, their point of origin and operating system and to monitor performance with our Services.  Web beacons do not collect Personal Information.
The information collected with these technologies may include (i) your internet protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, location, browser type, and internet service provider information; (ii) information about when and how you access and use NRS Websites or Services, such as the domains you visit, what features you used and for how long, the website that referred you to us, and date/time stamps associated with your usage; (iii) information about the device you use to access NRS Websites or services, such as device type, device ID, and device/browser settings; and (iv) location of the device used to access the NRS Websites or services derived from GPS or WiFi use.
Cookies can be “Persistent” or “Session” Cookies. Persistent Cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while Session Cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser. We differentiate between Cookies that are essential for the technical features of our Sites and optional analytics and advertising Cookies, as follows:
Cookie Type
Description
Essential Cookies
These are cookies that NRS Websites need to function, and that enable you to move around and use NRS Websites and features.  You do not need to enable cookies to visit NRS Websites; however, some aspects of NRS Websites may be difficult or impossible to use if cookies are disabled.  Examples of where these cookies are used include: to determine when you are signed in, to determine when your account has been inactive, and for other troubleshooting and security purposes.
Analytics Cookies
Analytics cookies allow us to understand more about how many visitors we have to NRS Websites, how many times they visit us and how many times a user viewed specific pages within NRS Websites.  Although analytics cookies allow us to gather specific information about the sites that you visit and whether you have visited NRS Websites multiple times, we cannot use them to find out details such as your name or address.
We use certain Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Remarketing and Demographics and Interest Reporting.  Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google that allows us to collect data about the traffic on the NRS Websites through Google cookies and other identifiers, which enables us, among other things, to create user segments based on demographic or interest data and to deliver relevant advertising.  Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of our websites and to prepare reports on the activities and share them with other Google services.  Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.  You may be able to opt out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features through your browser ads settings or by visiting Google’s Ads Settings page.  For more information regarding how Google collects, uses and shares your information, please refer to “How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps that Use Our Services,” which can be found at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time.
For information on how you can manage Cookies, please see the “Your Rights and How To Limit Sharing Of Information” section below.
7.
Your Rights and How To Limit Sharing Of Information
You may have choices about how we use and share your information and there are additional protections that may apply with regard to certain information we collect.
A. Communications.
If you do not wish to receive promotional communications from NRS, you can opt out at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in those communications, or by contacting us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below.  Please note that NRS may still continue to send you non-promotional emails, such as those regarding your orders, feedback submissions, and other service-related matters.
B. Promotional Emails.  You may choose to provide us with your email address for the purpose of allowing us to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you, as well as targeted offers from third parties.  You can opt out of receiving promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in emails that you receive.  If you decide not to receive promotional emails, we may still send you service-related communications.
C. Promotional Mailings.  If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us by mail, you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by emailing us (our contact information is below) with “NO SNAIL MAIL” in the subject line along with your name, address, and zip code. Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent.  Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.
D. Promotional Text Messages.  You can opt-out of receiving marketing text messages at any time by replying “STOP,” or following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the text messages that you receive.
E. Cookies.  Web browser applications (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Apple Safari) typically have features that prevent cookies from being sent or notify you when they are sent.  You will need to update your browser’s cookie settings in accordance with your preferences.  Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.  If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to update each browser’s settings separately. Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked.  NRS does not respond to DNT signals or other similar mechanisms.  If you are using a mobile device, you can reset your device settings to limit the use of information collected about you, including your location data.  This is typically done by disabling your location settings/permissions. Please contact Apple Support or Google for Android (as applicable) for more information on how to do this on your device.  You can stop all collection of information via our mobile application by uninstalling the application from your device.
F. Analytics.
Google provides users choices on how their data is collected by Google Analytics by developing an Opt-out Browser Add-on which can be located at:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.  By installing this Add-on, no information is being sent to Google Analytics.
G. Push Notifications.  You can opt out of receiving push notifications from us via the NRS Apps by going to your device “Settings” and clicking on “Notifications,” and then changing those settings for the applicable app.  Please note that you cannot withdraw your consent to receive certain in app messages from us.  Your ability to manage some of our Services could be limited if you withdraw your consent to receive text and SMS messages.  In those cases NRS does not recommend using those Services without authorization to receive such messages.
H. Other Rights.  In certain jurisdictions, such as California, you may also have the following rights regarding your Personal Information (see Section 8 and the Exhibits to this Policy for full details):
Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information.  You may request access to your Personal Information by contacting us at the address described below or filling out the applicable state request form at
www.idt.net
.  If required by law, upon request, we will grant you reasonable access to the Personal Information that we have about you.  Note that residents of certain jurisdictions may be entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of Personal Information (if any) we disclose with third parties or affiliates for direct marketing;
Request to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information.  Typically we retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.  You may, however, request that we delete your Personal Information by contacting us at the address described below or filling out the applicable state request form at
www.idt.net
.  If you revoke your consent for the processing of Personal Information, we may no longer be able to provide you certain services.  If required by law we will grant a request to delete information, but you should note that in many situations we must keep your Personal Information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for another one of our business purposes;
Right to Request Correction of Your Personal Information.  You have the right to request that we correct or supplement any inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information we process about you.  Depending on the purposes of the processing, you may have the right to have incomplete Personal Information completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement;
Right to Data Portability.  In certain circumstances you have the right to request that we provide the Personal Information which you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format; and you have the right to transmit such Personal Information to another entity;
Right of Non-Discrimination/Retaliation.  We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise any of their rights described in this Policy, nor do we retaliate against individuals who exercise these rights.  However, NRS may require use of your Personal Information to provide access to the Services. Therefore, when you exercise your deletion right, in particular, you may lose access to certain aspects of the Services that require your Personal Information; and/or
Right to Opt Out of Our Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information (in certain instances and if permissible under applicable law).  You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your Sensitive Personal Information.  However, we do not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those expressed in this Policy or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under applicable law.
Many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations.  For example, you may be located in a jurisdiction that does not give you the right to make these requests.  In such a case, your request may not be fulfilled.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, unduly burdensome, risk the privacy of others, or would be very impractical to honor.  If we are not able to provide the requested information or make the change you requested, you will be provided with the reasons for such decisions.
To exercise these rights, your request must:  (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.  We may need additional information to confirm your identity or your authorized agent’s identity (such as your name, email address and date of birth) or to obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf.  If our verification process is successful, we will respond to your request within the time and in the manner required by applicable law.  If we cannot validate the identity of you and/or your authorized agent or obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf, we will attempt to contact you to inform you.
If you designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf.  You must provide us with a copy of the signed permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us.  If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual, you must attach a copy of a completed Authorized Agent Designation Form (or equivalent form) indicating that you have authorization to act on the individual’s behalf.
You can submit your request by contacting us at the address described below or filling out the applicable state request form at
www.idt.net
.

B. Security.  NRS has technical, organizational and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of the information we collect and store.  Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information.  NRS secures information on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection to protect the personal information transmitted to the NRS Websites and NRS Web Stores.  The NRS Websites, NRS Apps and NRS Web Stores are PCI compliant in connection with your credit card information.  Although we work hard to protect your information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose Personal Information.  By using the NRS Websites, you accept that risk.  NRS maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to Personal Information we collect or store.  In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your Personal Information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.  If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us.

We may share all the information we collect and receive with our affiliates, both in and outside the United States, and to select service providers and vendors, to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services (and some third party services), and for general, operational and administrative purposes, including maintaining your account, authenticating you and contacting you.  We also share information with each NRS store with which you interact.  When we share information with our service providers and vendors, we require them to use your information only in accordance with our instructions and terms or with express permission from you and not to sell your information.  In addition, you share your information as you use and communicate through our Services.

Cookies & Other Tracking Technology
Our Services may use “cookies,” web beacons, and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to automatically collect users’ information (including Personal Information).  Cookies are small data files that are transferred to users’ web browsers and/or stored on their devices as they are browsing.  We may use Cookies to improve our Services and make your user experience online more customized and efficient.  Among other uses, Cookies help us recognize repeat users, facilitate users’ access to and use of NRS Websites, and track users’ behavior on websites they visit.  We may compile aggregate data for statistical purposes to improve the content of our Sites or to better administer the web pages available on the Sites.
Web beacons are used to tell us how and when pages in our sites are visited, by how many people, their point of origin and operating system and to monitor performance with our Services.  Web beacons do not collect Personal Information.
The information collected with these technologies may include (i) your internet protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, location, browser type, and internet service provider information; (ii) information about when and how you access and use NRS Websites or Services, such as the domains you visit, what features you used and for how long, the website that referred you to us, and date/time stamps associated with your usage; (iii) information about the device you use to access NRS Websites or services, such as device type, device ID, and device/browser settings; and (iv) location of the device used to access the NRS Websites or services derived from GPS or WiFi use.

Cookies.  Web browser applications (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Apple Safari) typically have features that prevent cookies from being sent or notify you when they are sent.  You will need to update your browser’s cookie settings in accordance with your preferences.  Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.  If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to update each browser’s settings separately. Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked.  NRS does not respond to DNT signals or other similar mechanisms.  If you are using a mobile device, you can reset your device settings to limit the use of information collected about you, including your location data.  This is typically done by disabling your location settings/permissions. Please contact Apple Support or Google for Android (as applicable) for more information on how to do this on your device.  You can stop all collection of information via our mobile application by uninstalling the application from your device.
F. Analytics.
Google provides users choices on how their data is collected by Google Analytics by developing an Opt-out Browser Add-on which can be located at:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.  By installing this Add-on, no information is being sent to Google Analytics.
G. Push Notifications.  You can opt out of receiving push notifications from us via the NRS Apps by going to your device “Settings” and clicking on “Notifications,” and then changing those settings for the applicable app.  Please note that you cannot withdraw your consent to receive certain in app messages from us.  Your ability to manage some of our Services could be limited if you withdraw your consent to receive text and SMS messages.  In those cases NRS does not recommend using those Services without authorization to receive such messages.
H. Other Rights.  In certain jurisdictions, such as California, you may also have the following rights regarding your Personal Information (see Section 8 and the Exhibits to this Policy for full details):
Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information.  You may request access to your Personal Information by contacting us at the address described below or filling out the applicable state request form at
www.idt.net
.  If required by law, upon request, we will grant you reasonable access to the Personal Information that we have about you.  Note that residents of certain jurisdictions may be entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of Personal Information (if any) we disclose with third parties or affiliates for direct marketing;
Request to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information.  Typically we retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.  You may, however, request that we delete your Personal Information by contacting us at the address described below or filling out the applicable state request form at
www.idt.net
.  If you revoke your consent for the processing of Personal Information, we may no longer be able to provide you certain services.  If required by law we will grant a request to delete information, but you should note that in many situations we must keep your Personal Information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for another one of our business purposes;
Right to Request Correction of Your Personal Information.  You have the right to request that we correct or supplement any inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information we process about you.  Depending on the purposes of the processing, you may have the right to have incomplete Personal Information completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement;
Right to Data Portability.  In certain circumstances you have the right to request that we provide the Personal Information which you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format; and you have the right to transmit such Personal Information to another entity;
Right of Non-Discrimination/Retaliation.  We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise any of their rights described in this Policy, nor do we retaliate against individuals who exercise these rights.  However, NRS may require use of your Personal Information to provide access to the Services. Therefore, when you exercise your deletion right, in particular, you may lose access to certain aspects of the Services that require your Personal Information; and/or
Right to Opt Out of Our Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information (in certain instances and if permissible under applicable law).  You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your Sensitive Personal Information.  However, we do not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those expressed in this Policy or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under applicable law.
Many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations.  For example, you may be located in a jurisdiction that does not give you the right to make these requests.  In such a case, your request may not be fulfilled.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, unduly burdensome, risk the privacy of others, or would be very impractical to honor.  If we are not able to provide the requested information or make the change you requested, you will be provided with the reasons for such decisions.
To exercise these rights, your request must:  (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.  We may need additional information to confirm your identity or your authorized agent’s identity (such as your name, email address and date of birth) or to obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf.  If our verification process is successful, we will respond to your request within the time and in the manner required by applicable law.  If we cannot validate the identity of you and/or your authorized agent or obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf, we will attempt to contact you to inform you.
If you designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf.  You must provide us with a copy of the signed permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us.  If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual, you must attach a copy of a completed Authorized Agent Designation Form (or equivalent form) indicating that you have authorization to act on the individual’s behalf.
You can submit your request by contacting us at the address described below or filling out the applicable state request form at

E. Verification of Consumer Requests.  In order to comply with a consumer request, NRS must reasonably verify the requestor.  A record of each request is made as soon as it is received by our data protection team.  NRS will use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of the individual making the request.  We will utilize the requested data to ensure that we can verify the requestor’s identity and where we are unable to do so, we may contact you for further information, or ask you to provide evidence of your identity prior to responding to your request.  This is to protect your data and rights.  If a third party, relative or representative is requesting the data on your behalf, we will verify their authority to act for you and may contact you and them to confirm you and their identity and gain your authorization prior to responding to the request.
F. Responding to Consumer Requests.  NRS will attempt to confirm receipt of each request by contacting the requestor either at the email or telephone number submitted, through the consumer’s account or by other electronic means.  NRS will attempt to verify each request and if it is able to verify a request will provide a response (if necessary and applicable) within 45 days of the receipt of the request, which time period may be extended by NRS for an additional 45 days.  If a delay is necessary, NRS will contact the requestor within the original 45 day period and provide the reasons for the delay.  NRS may charge a fee or refuse to act on any request that is manifestly unfounded or excessive.  All NRS responses shall be in writing and cover the previous 12 month period unless the consumer requests information beyond the 12 month period (only applies to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022).  Where possible the response shall be sent through the consumer’s account.  Otherwise, the response shall be sent by mail or electronically.  NRS is not obligated to provide a response to a consumer more than two times in any 12 month period.  The CCPA contains certain exemptions and exceptions to the exercise of some of these rights.  If one or more of those exemptions or exceptions applies to your request, then we may not be able to act upon your request.  Where possible we will inform you of the reasons for not acting upon your request.
G. How Long will NRS Retain Your Personal Information.  NRS retains your personal information for only as long as is necessary to carry out the purposes described above in this privacy policy, and we have strict review and retention policies in place to meet these obligations.  This time period may vary depending on the type of information and the services used, as detailed below, and applicable law, which may require us to maintain information for a set amount of time.  After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.  We may also retain aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services.  You cannot be identified from anonymized information retained or used for these purposes.
(i) Customer account information – we store your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate your service.  We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our services.  We are required under certain applicable tax laws to keep your basic personal information (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of six years after which time it will be destroyed unless required to be kept for other purposes.
(ii) Communications usage information – while you are an active customer, we retain the communications usage information generated by your use of our services until the information is no longer necessary to provide our services, and for a reasonable time thereafter as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our services.
(iii) Marketing information, cookies and web beacons – where you have consented to us using your details for direct marketing, we will keep such data until you notify us otherwise and/or withdraw your consent.  We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.
