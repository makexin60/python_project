3. Blockchain and Wallet Usage
Players in
Land Before The War
can create a
non-custodial wallet
linked to their profile. This wallet allows players to:
Mint in-game assets using gems (the premium currency, not a crypto token).
Trade these digitized assets on a marketplace if they choose to participate in blockchain-based activities.
The wallet is linked to the user profile for authentication, but any blockchain transactions are public and not tracked or stored by us.
4. In-App Purchases and Loot Boxes
In-app purchases, including loot boxes, season passes, and premium currency (gems), are processed through
Apple Pay
and
Google Pay
. Players can make these purchases to enhance their experience, but no blockchain tokens are involved. There are no specific restrictions, though age ratings may vary by country due to loot boxes.
5. Free-to-Play Model
Land Before The War
is a free-to-play game with optional in-app purchases, such as:
Loot boxes
Season passes
Premium currency (gems)
While these purchases are optional, they can enhance the gameplay experience.
6. Data Storage and Transfers
User information, including usernames, game assets, and account details, is stored in our
MongoDB database
. This data may be transferred internationally, and we take the necessary steps to comply with applicable data protection laws, such as GDPR and CCPA, where required.
7. Third-Party Services
We use the
MongoDB database
for user data storage and management. Additionally, when minting or trading assets on the blockchain, the app interacts with external blockchain services. We do not share data with third-party advertisers, and no personal information is sold to third parties.
8. Age Restrictions
The app may have different age ratings in various countries due to loot boxes. Parents are encouraged to monitor their children’s activity in the game. While we haven’t taken specific measures for minors' privacy, the age rating on app stores reflects potential content restrictions.
9. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. However, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
10. User Rights
If you wish to delete your account or access your data, please contact us. We will take steps to process your request, although some data (e.g., game progress) may be necessary to maintain your account functionality.
11. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please review it regularly to stay informed of any changes. Continued use of the App after changes to this policy constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
