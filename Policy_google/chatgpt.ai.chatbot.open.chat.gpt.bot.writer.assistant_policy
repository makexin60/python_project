          different age threshold or explicit parental authorization is provided. We do not knowingly collect
          information from users who qualify as “child”.
Should any personal data from a child be identified without proper consent, we will immediately remove it from
          our systems. If you suspect we may have collected information from or about a child through the App without
          guardian approval, please contact us immediately.
III. THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING DATA

For more information about the way Google shares your data using Google account linking as well as for
              Google contact details please refer to Section V of this Privacy Policy.
(b) Payment Information
Our e-commerce provider, Google, is responsible for securely processing and charging for in-app
              purchases, and for handling your personal information in a safe and secure manner. We do not have access
              to or use your credit or debit card information as this is processed as part of the contract between you
              and Google. You may access the rules and policies for in-app purchases directly from the app stores. You
              can access the relevant rules and policies for "in-app" purchases directly from the app stores.
To improve the App and personalize your experience: We use automatically processed information to analyze
            how users interact with the App, identify areas for improvement, and test new features and functionality.
            This helps us to continuously improve the App and provide a better service. We may use automatically
            processed information to personalize your experience within the App. For example, we may use this
            information to show you content that is tailored to your interests, or to suggest features or services
            that may be of interest to you.
(c) Automatically Processed Data
Log file information. When you access the App, log file information is automatically generated and
                reported. Additionally, this information may be provided when you install the App on your device. Our
                analytics tools automatically record specific log file information when you use the App, such as the
                start and stop time and date of usage, and how you interact with the App.
Mobile Device Data, including “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar
                data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile
                device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized
                content and ads by the third parties. Certain device identifiers are processed to improve the quality
                of customer support. We automatically process information about the device itself (type of device,
                type of operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density,
                orientation, audio volume and battery, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, device memory
                usage), information about the Internet connection (mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP
                address, timestamp and duration of sessions, speed, browser), location-related information (IP
                address, the country code/ region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device, language
                setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of interest (eg. “coffee shop”)), other device
                identifiers: e.g. user identifiers (if they are set up by the App’s developer). In case you submit a
                support request, the device identifiers to be processed additionally comprise your device ID
                (identification number of your mobile device) and your user ID (the number assigned to the App upon
                its installation at your device). The processing of user ID and device ID enables us to review your
                support request in a more detailed manner as applied to your particular case. This therefore may allow
                us a) to expedite your support request (e.g. complete troubleshooting); and, if needed b) to approach
                you with a tailor-made solution for fixing the issue being of concern for you.
Cookies and similar technologies. When you use the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used
                (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which
                is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to the server
                each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will
                know how many users access specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads they
                clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve
                our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask
                advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar
                technologies.
Information about the applications. Name, API key (identifier for application), version, properties of
                our App can be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some services also record the list of
                applications and/or processes which are installed or run on your device.
Ad-related information. Information related to advertisements that you view, such as the time and date
                the ad is shown, whether you clicked on it or if it resulted in a conversion event, the content and
                type of the ad (such as text, image, or video), where it was displayed in the App, and your response
                to the ad, may be reported.
In-App Events. Analytics tools integrated into our App automatically capture and store data related to
                your in-App activities, such as completing tutorial steps, making in-app purchases or payments,
                triggering custom events, progressing through levels or stages, and any opt-out mechanisms used to
                limit data processing.
The data is processed via third-party automatic data processing technologies, such as advertising or
              analytics tools, to analyze certain information sent by your device through our App (e.g.,Advertising ID
              or Android ID for Android devices), with your permission. This data is typically non-personal, meaning
              it cannot be directly linked to any specific individual, and we only access it in an aggregated form.
              However, some of these integrated tools (please see
Section V
for a list) may conduct automated processing of your
              personal data, including profiling. Profiling
              involves any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects
              relating to you, particularly to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences,
              interests, behavior, location or movements (please refer to the list of data below). Automatic data
              processing technologies will start processing information as soon as you allow our App to track your
              activity. You may withdraw your permission at any time by checking the opt-out options in Section VIII
              below.
Please note that we do not have control over the information provided automatically to advertising or
              analytics tools, and therefore cannot take responsibility for the processing of such information. It is
              important to be aware that some services engage in personal data profiling and may obtain information
              related to your personality or device through technologies that are not under our responsibility. If
              your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook may use your device information in conjunction
              with categorized data that have already been recorded in its databases, such as your age, gender, or
              other demographic indicators. We do not supervise, control, or guarantee how third parties handle your
              personal data that may be collected through means other than our app. If you have any questions about
              the disclosure of your personal information, please direct them to the third parties involved (refer to
Section V
).
To communicate with you: We may use your contact information to communicate with you about the App, such
            as to provide you with updates, marketing notifications, respond to your inquiries and provide customer
            support. We may also arrange in-app surveys, which you are free to take part in to share your user
            experience with the App.
(d) Contact Information:
your name, your email address and data that you might enter
              and upload as a part of your support request or while you take part in our in-app surveys.
To conduct interviews about your experience with the App.
(e) Additional personal information:
name (real
              or alias), image and/or certain biographical data, speech, voice
              and/or appearances.
Please note that we only hold interviews with you and therefore
              process the respective personal data subject to your explicit
              consent.
To enforce our policies and protect our rights: We may use your
            information to enforce our policies and protect our rights,
            including investigating and preventing fraud, spam, or other
            unauthorized activity, and complying with legal obligations.
If we use your information for any other purpose not listed here, we
          will notify you and obtain your consent as required by applicable
          law.
IV. HOW LONG WE KEEP AND USE YOUR DATA
We will keep your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the functional service of
          the App and to fulfill our legal obligations. If you decide that you no longer want us to use your
          information that we physically access and store, you can request that we delete your personal information
          and close your account.
However, some data may still be stored for a limited period of time (but no longer than necessary) if
          required by law (such as for taxation, accounting, or auditing purposes) or to maintain the safety and
          backup of data, prevent fraud, or other malicious acts.
V. SHARING OF DATA
When we integrate external services, we carefully select third-party providers who ensure the implementation
          of appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data. However, we cannot
          guarantee the security of any information transmitted to such third-party providers. We are not liable for
          any accidental loss or unauthorized access to your personal data due to the actions of third-party
          providers.
We do not rent or sell your personal data to third parties, but we may share information from tools like
          cookies, log files, device identifiers, and location data with third-party organizations that provide
          automatic data processing technologies for the App. We do not have control over these third parties'
          tracking technologies or their usage.
We may also share certain information, such as cookie data, with third-party advertising partners. This
          information enables third-party ad networks to deliver targeted ads that they believe will be of most
          interest to you.

          refer to the respective websites and privacy policies.
Our App may include links to third-party websites or services, or you may access our App from a third-party
          site. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party sites or
          services, including the information or content contained within them. You are solely responsible for any
          risk arising from your use of these third-party websites or resources.
Please note that certain third-party providers may engage sub-processors. This implies that your personal
          data collected by third-party providers can be shared with affiliates as well as other persons engaged
          thereby. If you want to learn more about the cases of sharing your personal data with sub-processors as well

VI. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
We and third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App or our
          third-party advertising partners may transfer the information processed automatically across borders and
          from your jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
Please be aware that this means we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country
          and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as in your jurisdiction. As a result, your
          personal information may be transferred to a third country, a territory, or one or more specified sectors
          within that third country, or to an international organization where data protection and confidentiality
          regulations may not provide the same level of protection for personal data as your jurisdiction does. When
          data is transferred to a country or jurisdiction with significantly different data protection laws than
          yours, we provide clear information about the potential risks. This enables you to make an informed decision
          regarding the transfer and the use of related features in our App. Please refer to the details below.
By using the App, you agree that we may transfer your personal data to any third country, a territory, or
          one or more specified sectors within that third country, or to an international organization.
For data storage purposes, we use the services of hosting providers. We take your privacy seriously and,
          where possible, encrypt your personal data before sending it to the hosting providers for storage. Please
          note that we only work with hosting providers that have passed our security and reliability checks.
When you use DeepSeek models, your Input content may be transmitted to and processed by Hangzhou
          DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd., based in China. The data will be stored following
DeepSeek's
            Privacy Policy
Please note that
data privacy laws in China may be significantly different
from those in your
          country or
          other regions. We encourage you to read DeepSeek's Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the
          terms or have any privacy concerns, please refrain from using DeepSeek models in our App. Below, we
summarize the key points from this policy for your awareness
(for more details, please refer
          to the full
          version of DeepSeek's Privacy Policy):
Data Usage:
DeepSeek may use your data for purposes such as improving services, serving advertisements and machine
          learning. Please note that there are no opt-out options available for these purposes. For more details,
          refer to the "How We Use Your Information" section in DeepSeek's Privacy Policy.
Data Sharing:
DeepSeek's Privacy Policy does not provide a detailed list of third-party partners with whom they share
          data. Instead, it outlines general principles regarding data sharing. Data may be also shared if required
          to comply with laws, legal processes, or requests from government authorities, including those from
          Chinese authorities. For further details, see the "How We Share Your Information" section in DeepSeek's
          Privacy Policy.
Differences in other Data Protection Standards:
The data retention requirements, security measures, and your rights may differ from the privacy standards
          in your country. Please review the relevant sections in DeepSeek's Privacy Policy to understand these
          differences.
To protect your privacy, we only send your Input content to DeepSeek, without including any personally
          identifiable information such as names or emails.
If you have any concerns, you can choose not to use features that involve transferring data to foreign
          jurisdictions or avoid submitting sensitive information in your Inputs.
VII. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
Applicable data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information. You have the
          following options in relation to your personal information that was collected (please note, that your privacy
          rights may vary depending on whether you are located):
Access to Information:
You can confirm whether we process your data and request a copy of
            it, including details about how it’s used.
Data Portability:

contact form
. However,
          please note that we can only ensure the aforementioned

Section II PROCESSED INFORMATION
>>
Section III THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING DATA
>>
PERSONAL DATA
This Section applies only to information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to you as an individual.
          It does not cover data that has been de-identified, aggregated, or made publicly available, as such
          information is not considered "personal data" under some U.S. Privacy laws.
SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Learn about the methods of sharing your information in
Section V
. Please be aware that all third-party processors of user
          data are service providers who use such information in accordance with a contractual agreement and for a
          business purpose. To prevent the sharing of device identifiers and geolocation data with service providers,
          please refer to your device settings for instructions on opting out, as described above in
Section VIII
.
SALE OF DATA
We do not engage in the sale of any of your personal data to third parties. While we do not sell your personal
          information for money, some U.S. Privacy laws consider sharing data for advertising purposes a “sale”. If this
          applies, you can opt out (refer to
Section VIII
).
YOUR RIGHTS
As if this Section is relevant to you you’ll be able to exercise all rights in accordance with
Section VII
. However, some aspects related
          to these rights may vary slightly from one jurisdiction/state to another, therefore, you may want to consider
          these differences when submitting your user privacy request.
Depending on your state and the relevant U.S. Privacy laws, you may also have the right to:
Opt-out of
1) the “sharing” of your personal information for “cross-contextual behavioral advertising,” often
                referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “targeted advertising;
2) the use of automated decision making in relation to your personal information;
3) any future “sales” or “sharing” of your personal information as defined by applicable U.S. Privacy
                laws.
To exercise the rights conferred on you by the U.S. Privacy laws without discrimination.
Right to Opt Out
To stop tracking your аd preferences via your device, please refer to
Section VIII “Marketing tracking”
.
Limiting access to your advertising identifier may not prevent personalized ads from all sources. Many
          companies and networks participating in industry self-regulation programs offer independent opt-out tools. To
          explore these options, visit
Section VIII “Targeted
            Advertising”
.
Certain advertising and analytics platforms provide their own tools for managing data preferences. Examples
          include
Google’s ad settings
,
"Facebook about ads" page
, and
AppsFlyer’s
opt-out feature. For a current list of our service providers (processors), see
Section V
.
Please know that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will not receive advertising.
          You may still receive ads, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.
YOUR RIGHT TO REQUEST
If you wish to request access, portability, deletion or correction of inaccuracies (if applicable) of your
          personal information, please get in touch with us using the provided
contact form
.
When submitting a request, please take note of the following:
(a) include in its text the phrase “Exercising my rights to maintain confidentiality in … State”, replacing
            '...' with the name of the state of your residence. We will make every effort to satisfy any request you
            make to exercise any of your privacy rights;
(b) describe your request with enough detail for us to understand and respond to it properly;
(c) provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify your identity (your name, address, city,
            state, zip code, and email address).

          through an authorized agent, they must provide written authorization or a power of attorney signed by you to
          confirm their authority to act on your behalf.
In order to fulfill your request, we must be able to verify your identity and confirm that the personal
          information pertains to you. If we cannot verify your identity or the authenticity of the request, we may not
          be able to fulfill your request or respond to your request. To verify your identity, we may require additional
          information or documentation. We may also perform identity checks, including through third-party verification
          services. These measures are in place to protect the security and privacy of your personal information and
          prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification.
We will handle any personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request with care and ensure that it
          is only used for the purpose of verifying the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. We will
          maintain this information for a reasonable period required for the above-stated purpose and dispose of it
          after the purpose has been accomplished.
We aim to respond to your verifiable consumer request within 45 days of receiving it. If we need more time to
          respond, we will notify you in writing of the reason and the extension period. It is important to note that we

          different age threshold or explicit parental authorization is provided. We do not knowingly collect
          information from users who qualify as “child”.

(b) Payment Information
Our e-commerce provider, Google, is responsible for securely processing and charging for in-app
              purchases, and for handling your personal information in a safe and secure manner. We do not have access
              to or use your credit or debit card information as this is processed as part of the contract between you
              and Google. You may access the rules and policies for in-app purchases directly from the app stores. You
              can access the relevant rules and policies for "in-app" purchases directly from the app stores.
To improve the App and personalize your experience: We use automatically processed information to analyze
            how users interact with the App, identify areas for improvement, and test new features and functionality.
            This helps us to continuously improve the App and provide a better service. We may use automatically
            processed information to personalize your experience within the App. For example, we may use this
            information to show you content that is tailored to your interests, or to suggest features or services
            that may be of interest to you.
(c) Automatically Processed Data
Log file information. When you access the App, log file information is automatically generated and
                reported. Additionally, this information may be provided when you install the App on your device. Our
                analytics tools automatically record specific log file information when you use the App, such as the
                start and stop time and date of usage, and how you interact with the App.
Mobile Device Data, including “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar
                data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile
                device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized
                content and ads by the third parties. Certain device identifiers are processed to improve the quality
                of customer support. We automatically process information about the device itself (type of device,
                type of operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density,
                orientation, audio volume and battery, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, device memory
                usage), information about the Internet connection (mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP
                address, timestamp and duration of sessions, speed, browser), location-related information (IP
                address, the country code/ region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device, language
                setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of interest (eg. “coffee shop”)), other device
                identifiers: e.g. user identifiers (if they are set up by the App’s developer). In case you submit a
                support request, the device identifiers to be processed additionally comprise your device ID
                (identification number of your mobile device) and your user ID (the number assigned to the App upon
                its installation at your device). The processing of user ID and device ID enables us to review your
                support request in a more detailed manner as applied to your particular case. This therefore may allow
                us a) to expedite your support request (e.g. complete troubleshooting); and, if needed b) to approach
                you with a tailor-made solution for fixing the issue being of concern for you.
Cookies and similar technologies. When you use the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used
                (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which
                is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to the server
                each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will
                know how many users access specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads they
                clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve
                our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask
                advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar
                technologies.
Information about the applications. Name, API key (identifier for application), version, properties of
                our App can be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some services also record the list of
                applications and/or processes which are installed or run on your device.
Ad-related information. Information related to advertisements that you view, such as the time and date
                the ad is shown, whether you clicked on it or if it resulted in a conversion event, the content and
                type of the ad (such as text, image, or video), where it was displayed in the App, and your response
                to the ad, may be reported.
In-App Events. Analytics tools integrated into our App automatically capture and store data related to
                your in-App activities, such as completing tutorial steps, making in-app purchases or payments,
                triggering custom events, progressing through levels or stages, and any opt-out mechanisms used to
                limit data processing.
The data is processed via third-party automatic data processing technologies, such as advertising or
              analytics tools, to analyze certain information sent by your device through our App (e.g.,Advertising ID
              or Android ID for Android devices), with your permission. This data is typically non-personal, meaning
              it cannot be directly linked to any specific individual, and we only access it in an aggregated form.
              However, some of these integrated tools (please see
Section V
for a list) may conduct automated processing of your
              personal data, including profiling. Profiling
              involves any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects
              relating to you, particularly to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences,
              interests, behavior, location or movements (please refer to the list of data below). Automatic data
              processing technologies will start processing information as soon as you allow our App to track your
              activity. You may withdraw your permission at any time by checking the opt-out options in Section VIII
              below.
Please note that we do not have control over the information provided automatically to advertising or
              analytics tools, and therefore cannot take responsibility for the processing of such information. It is
              important to be aware that some services engage in personal data profiling and may obtain information
              related to your personality or device through technologies that are not under our responsibility. If
              your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook may use your device information in conjunction
              with categorized data that have already been recorded in its databases, such as your age, gender, or
              other demographic indicators. We do not supervise, control, or guarantee how third parties handle your
              personal data that may be collected through means other than our app. If you have any questions about
              the disclosure of your personal information, please direct them to the third parties involved (refer to
Section V
).
To communicate with you: We may use your contact information to communicate with you about the App, such
            as to provide you with updates, marketing notifications, respond to your inquiries and provide customer
            support. We may also arrange in-app surveys, which you are free to take part in to share your user
            experience with the App.
(d) Contact Information:
your name, your email address and data that you might enter
              and upload as a part of your support request or while you take part in our in-app surveys.
To conduct interviews about your experience with the App.
(e) Additional personal information:
name (real
              or alias), image and/or certain biographical data, speech, voice
              and/or appearances.
Please note that we only hold interviews with you and therefore
              process the respective personal data subject to your explicit
              consent.
To enforce our policies and protect our rights: We may use your
            information to enforce our policies and protect our rights,
            including investigating and preventing fraud, spam, or other
            unauthorized activity, and complying with legal obligations.
If we use your information for any other purpose not listed here, we
          will notify you and obtain your consent as required by applicable
          law.
IV. HOW LONG WE KEEP AND USE YOUR DATA
We will keep your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the functional service of
          the App and to fulfill our legal obligations. If you decide that you no longer want us to use your
          information that we physically access and store, you can request that we delete your personal information
          and close your account.
However, some data may still be stored for a limited period of time (but no longer than necessary) if
          required by law (such as for taxation, accounting, or auditing purposes) or to maintain the safety and
          backup of data, prevent fraud, or other malicious acts.
V. SHARING OF DATA
When we integrate external services, we carefully select third-party providers who ensure the implementation
          of appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data. However, we cannot
          guarantee the security of any information transmitted to such third-party providers. We are not liable for
          any accidental loss or unauthorized access to your personal data due to the actions of third-party
          providers.
We do not rent or sell your personal data to third parties, but we may share information from tools like
          cookies, log files, device identifiers, and location data with third-party organizations that provide
          automatic data processing technologies for the App. We do not have control over these third parties'
          tracking technologies or their usage.
We may also share certain information, such as cookie data, with third-party advertising partners. This
          information enables third-party ad networks to deliver targeted ads that they believe will be of most
          interest to you.

If you want to know more about the privacy options and services of our App, including how to opt-out, please
          refer to the respective websites and privacy policies.
Our App may include links to third-party websites or services, or you may access our App from a third-party
          site. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party sites or
          services, including the information or content contained within them. You are solely responsible for any
          risk arising from your use of these third-party websites or resources.
Please note that certain third-party providers may engage sub-processors. This implies that your personal
          data collected by third-party providers can be shared with affiliates as well as other persons engaged
          thereby. If you want to learn more about the cases of sharing your personal data with sub-processors as well
          as the scope of your personal data shared therewith please refer to the respective websites and privacy
          policies of the third-party providers.
We may disclose your personal information in situations where it is necessary for legitimate reasons, such

VI. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
We and third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App or our
          third-party advertising partners may transfer the information processed automatically across borders and
          from your jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
Please be aware that this means we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country
          and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as in your jurisdiction. As a result, your
          personal information may be transferred to a third country, a territory, or one or more specified sectors
          within that third country, or to an international organization where data protection and confidentiality
          regulations may not provide the same level of protection for personal data as your jurisdiction does. When
          data is transferred to a country or jurisdiction with significantly different data protection laws than
          yours, we provide clear information about the potential risks. This enables you to make an informed decision
          regarding the transfer and the use of related features in our App. Please refer to the details below.
By using the App, you agree that we may transfer your personal data to any third country, a territory, or
          one or more specified sectors within that third country, or to an international organization.
For data storage purposes, we use the services of hosting providers. We take your privacy seriously and,
          where possible, encrypt your personal data before sending it to the hosting providers for storage. Please
          note that we only work with hosting providers that have passed our security and reliability checks.
When you use DeepSeek models, your Input content may be transmitted to and processed by Hangzhou
          DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd., based in China. The data will be stored following
DeepSeek's
            Privacy Policy
Please note that
data privacy laws in China may be significantly different
from those in your
          country or
          other regions. We encourage you to read DeepSeek's Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the
          terms or have any privacy concerns, please refrain from using DeepSeek models in our App. Below, we
summarize the key points from this policy for your awareness
(for more details, please refer
          to the full
          version of DeepSeek's Privacy Policy):
Data Usage:
DeepSeek may use your data for purposes such as improving services, serving advertisements and machine
          learning. Please note that there are no opt-out options available for these purposes. For more details,
          refer to the "How We Use Your Information" section in DeepSeek's Privacy Policy.
Data Sharing:
DeepSeek's Privacy Policy does not provide a detailed list of third-party partners with whom they share
          data. Instead, it outlines general principles regarding data sharing. Data may be also shared if required
          to comply with laws, legal processes, or requests from government authorities, including those from
          Chinese authorities. For further details, see the "How We Share Your Information" section in DeepSeek's
          Privacy Policy.
Differences in other Data Protection Standards:
The data retention requirements, security measures, and your rights may differ from the privacy standards
          in your country. Please review the relevant sections in DeepSeek's Privacy Policy to understand these
          differences.
To protect your privacy, we only send your Input content to DeepSeek, without including any personally
          identifiable information such as names or emails.
If you have any concerns, you can choose not to use features that involve transferring data to foreign
          jurisdictions or avoid submitting sensitive information in your Inputs.

          rights may vary depending on whether you are located):

          processing in certain circumstances. If your personal information is being processed for direct marketing
          purposes, you may ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes. To exercise this right, please

          our Privacy Policy:
Section II PROCESSED INFORMATION
>>
Section III THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING DATA
>>
PERSONAL DATA
This Section applies only to information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to you as an individual.
          It does not cover data that has been de-identified, aggregated, or made publicly available, as such
          information is not considered "personal data" under some U.S. Privacy laws.
SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Learn about the methods of sharing your information in
Section V
. Please be aware that all third-party processors of user
          data are service providers who use such information in accordance with a contractual agreement and for a
          business purpose. To prevent the sharing of device identifiers and geolocation data with service providers,
          please refer to your device settings for instructions on opting out, as described above in
Section VIII
.
SALE OF DATA
We do not engage in the sale of any of your personal data to third parties. While we do not sell your personal
          information for money, some U.S. Privacy laws consider sharing data for advertising purposes a “sale”. If this
          applies, you can opt out (refer to
Section VIII
).
YOUR RIGHTS
As if this Section is relevant to you you’ll be able to exercise all rights in accordance with
Section VII
. However, some aspects related
          to these rights may vary slightly from one jurisdiction/state to another, therefore, you may want to consider
          these differences when submitting your user privacy request.
Depending on your state and the relevant U.S. Privacy laws, you may also have the right to:
Opt-out of
1) the “sharing” of your personal information for “cross-contextual behavioral advertising,” often
                referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “targeted advertising;
2) the use of automated decision making in relation to your personal information;
3) any future “sales” or “sharing” of your personal information as defined by applicable U.S. Privacy
                laws.
To exercise the rights conferred on you by the U.S. Privacy laws without discrimination.
Right to Opt Out
To stop tracking your аd preferences via your device, please refer to
Section VIII “Marketing tracking”
.
Limiting access to your advertising identifier may not prevent personalized ads from all sources. Many
          companies and networks participating in industry self-regulation programs offer independent opt-out tools. To
          explore these options, visit
Section VIII “Targeted
            Advertising”
.
Certain advertising and analytics platforms provide their own tools for managing data preferences. Examples
          include
Google’s ad settings
,
"Facebook about ads" page
, and
AppsFlyer’s
opt-out feature. For a current list of our service providers (processors), see
Section V
.
Please know that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will not receive advertising.
          You may still receive ads, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.
YOUR RIGHT TO REQUEST
If you wish to request access, portability, deletion or correction of inaccuracies (if applicable) of your
          personal information, please get in touch with us using the provided
contact form
.
When submitting a request, please take note of the following:
(a) include in its text the phrase “Exercising my rights to maintain confidentiality in … State”, replacing
            '...' with the name of the state of your residence. We will make every effort to satisfy any request you
            make to exercise any of your privacy rights;
(b) describe your request with enough detail for us to understand and respond to it properly;
(c) provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify your identity (your name, address, city,
            state, zip code, and email address).
We may use this information to ask you security questions to verify your identity. If you are making a request
          through an authorized agent, they must provide written authorization or a power of attorney signed by you to
          confirm their authority to act on your behalf.
In order to fulfill your request, we must be able to verify your identity and confirm that the personal
          information pertains to you. If we cannot verify your identity or the authenticity of the request, we may not
          be able to fulfill your request or respond to your request. To verify your identity, we may require additional
          information or documentation. We may also perform identity checks, including through third-party verification
          services. These measures are in place to protect the security and privacy of your personal information and
          prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification.
We will handle any personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request with care and ensure that it
          is only used for the purpose of verifying the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. We will
          maintain this information for a reasonable period required for the above-stated purpose and dispose of it
          after the purpose has been accomplished.
We aim to respond to your verifiable consumer request within 45 days of receiving it. If we need more time to
          respond, we will notify you in writing of the reason and the extension period. It is important to note that we
          are only obligated to fulfill two requests per customer per year.

Sub-policy 1
https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy:
Anthropic is an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and process your personal data when you use our website and other places where Anthropic acts as a
data controller
—for example, when you interact with Claude.ai or other products as a consumer for personal use ("
Services
") or when Anthropic operates and provides our commercial customers and their end users with access to our commercial products, such as the Claude Team plan (“
Commercial Services
”).
This Privacy Policy does not apply where Anthropic acts as a
data processor
and processes personal data on behalf of commercial customers using Anthropic’s Commercial Services – for example, your employer has provisioned you a Claude for Work account, or you're using an app that is powered on the back-end with Claude. In those cases, the commercial customer is the controller, and you can review their policies for more information about how they handle your personal data.
For information about how we collect and use personal data to develop our language models that power our Services, when we may receive and process personal data of non-users, and your choices with respect to that information, please see our
Notice on Model Training
.
This Privacy Policy also describes your privacy rights. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in Section 4 (“Rights and Choices”).
If you are located in Canada, please read section 11 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.
If you are located in Brazil, please read section 12 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.
1. Collection of Personal Data
We collect the following categories of personal data:
Personal data you provide to us directly
Identity and Contact Data:
Anthropic collects identifiers, including your name, email address, and phone number when you sign up for an Anthropic account, or to receive information on our Services. We may also collect or generate indirect identifiers (e.g., “USER12345”).
Payment Information:
We shall collect your payment information if you choose to purchase access to Anthropic’s products and services.
Inputs and Outputs:
Our AI services allow you to interact with the Services in a variety of formats (
“Prompts”
or
"Inputs"
), which generate responses (
“Outputs”
) based on your Inputs. This includes where you choose to integrate third-party applications with our services. If you include personal data or reference external content in your Inputs, we will collect that information and this information may be reproduced in your Outputs.
Feedback on your use of our Services:
We appreciate feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating an Output in response to an Input ("
Feedback
"). If you rate an Output in response to an Input—for example, by using the thumbs up/thumbs down icon—we will store the entire related conversation as part of your Feedback. You can learn more about how we use Feedback
here
.
Communication Information:
If you communicate with us, including via our chatbot on our Help site, we collect your name, contact information, and the contents of any messages you send.
Personal data we receive automatically from your use of the Services
When you use the Services, we also receive certain technical data automatically (described below, collectively “
Technical Information
”). This includes:

Consistent with your device or browser permissions, your device or browser automatically sends us information about when and how you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as your device type, operating system information, browser information and web page referers, mobile network, connection information, mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP), time zone setting, IP address (including information about the location of the device derived from your IP address), identifiers (including device or advertising identifiers, probabilistic identifiers, and other unique personal or online identifiers).
Usage Information.
We collect information about your use of the Services, such as the dates and times of access, browsing history, search, information about the links you click, pages you view, and other information about how you use the Services, and technology on the devices you use to access the Services.
Log and Troubleshooting Information.
We collect information about how our Services are performing when you use them. This information includes log files. If you or your device experiences an error, we may collect information about the error, the time the error occurred, the feature being used, the state of the application when the error occurred, and any communications or content provided at the time the error occurred.
Cookies & Similar Technologies.
We and our service providers use cookies, scripts, or similar technologies (“
Cookies
”) to manage the Services and to collect information about you and your use of the Services. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your experience, market additional products or services to you, and analyze the use of our Services to make them safer and more useful to you. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please visit our
Cookie Policy
.
Personal data we collect or receive to train our models
Anthropic obtains personal data from third party sources in order to train our models. Specifically, we train our models using data from the following sources:
Publicly available information via the Internet
Datasets that we obtain through commercial agreements with third party businesses
Data that our users or crowd workers provide
Data that we generate internally
For more information about how we collect and use personal data to develop our language models that power our Services, the steps we take to minimize the privacy impact on individuals through the training process, and your choices with respect to that information, please see our separate

Usage Policy

If we link to a site or service via our Services, you should read their data usage policies or other documentation. Our linking to another site or service doesn’t mean we endorse it or speak for that third party.
Pursuant to regulatory or legal requirements, safety, rights of others, and to enforce our rights or our terms.
We may disclose personal data to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for legal, tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal data to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise permitted or required by law, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of you or any other person, to protect against fraud or credit risk, to enforce our legal rights or the legal rights of others, to enforce contractual commitments that you have made, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.
With an individual's consent.

You can find information on our
Subprocessor List
about the third parties Anthropic engages to help us process personal data provided to us where Anthropic acts as a data processor, such as with respect to personal data we receive, process, store, or host when you use Anthropic's commercial services.
4. Rights and Choices
Depending on where you live and the laws that apply in your country of residence, you may enjoy certain rights regarding your personal data, as described further below. However, please be aware that these rights are limited, and that the process by which we may need to action your requests regarding our training dataset are complex. We may also decline a request if we have a lawful reason for doing so. That said, we strive to prioritize the protection of personal data, and comply with all applicable privacy laws.
To exercise your rights, you or an authorized agent may submit a request by emailing us at
privacy@anthropic.com
. After we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. You may also have the right to appeal requests that we deny by emailing
privacy@anthropic.com
. Anthropic will not discriminate based on the exercising of privacy rights you may have. Set out below is a summary of the rights which you may enjoy, depending on the laws that apply in your country of residence.
Right to know:
the right to know what personal data Anthropic processes about you, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collection, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.
Access & data portability:
the right to request a copy of the personal data Anthropic processes about you, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. In certain cases and subject to applicable law, you have the right to port your information.
Deletion:
the right to request that we delete personal data collected from you when you use our Services, subject to certain exceptions. You also are able to
delete individual conversations
, which will be removed immediately from your conversation history and automatically deleted from our back-end within 30 days. Learn more
here
.
Correction:
the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data Anthropic retains about you, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Outputs. If Outputs contain factually inaccurate personal data relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make a reasonable effort to correct this information—but due to the technical complexity of our large language models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.
Objection:
the right to object to processing of your personal data, including profiling conducted on grounds of public or legitimate interest. In places where such a right applies, we will no longer process the personal data in case of such objection unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. If we use your information for direct marketing, you can object and opt out of future direct marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in such communications.
Restriction:
the right to restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.
Withdrawal of consent.
Where Anthropic’s processing of your personal data is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Automated decision-making
: Anthropic does not engage in decision making based solely on automated processing or profiling in a manner which produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services).

.
5. Data Transfers
When you access our website or Services, your personal data may be transferred to our servers in the US, or to other countries outside the European Economic Area (
“EEA”
) and the UK. This may be a direct provision of your personal data to us, or a transfer that we or a third party make.
Where information is transferred outside the EEA or the UK, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:
Adequacy decisions.
These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country outside of the EEA offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed
here
; or
Standard contractual clauses.
The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.
In certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable data protection law to transfer information to a third country.
6. Data Retention, Data Lifecycle, and Security Controls
Anthropic retains your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes and criteria outlined in this Privacy Policy and explained further in our
privacy center
.
When the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.
Aggregated or De-Identified Information
We may process personal data in an aggregated or de-identified form to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, conduct research, study user behavior, and train our AI models as permitted under applicable laws. For instance:
When you submit Feedback, we disassociate Inputs and Outputs from your user ID to use them for training and improving our models.
If our systems flag Inputs or Outputs for potentially violating our
Usage Policy
, we disassociate the content from your user ID to train our trust and safety internal classification and generative models. However, we may re-identify the Inputs or Outputs to enforce our Usage Policy with the responsible user if necessary.
To improve user experience, we may analyze and aggregate general user behavior and usage data. This information does not identify individual users.
Security Controls Relating to our Processing of Personal Data
We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
7. Children
Our Services are not directed towards, and we do not knowingly collect, use, disclose, sell, or share any information about, children under the age of 18. If you become aware that a child under the age of 18 has provided any personal data to us while using our Services, please email us at
privacy@anthropic.com
and we will investigate the matter and, if appropriate, delete the personal data.

In case of conflict between our Privacy Policy and these supplemental disclosures, the supplemental disclosures shall prevail in relation to residents of Brazil.
Legal Bases. Depending on the specific purpose of the processing, we may rely on different grounds than those listed under section 2, where permitted by and in accordance with the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD). For example, we may rely on the "exercise of legal rights" basis to process personal data associated with customer complaints and to enforce our Terms of Service and similar terms and agreements, including our Usage Policy.
Data Subject's Rights. LGPD grants certain rights regarding your personal data, which differ from the ones listed under section 4. We will respond to your requests to exercise your rights below in accordance with applicable law:

Information of public and private entities with which we shared data. You have the right to request information of public and private entities with which we have shared your data.
Information about the possibility to refuse to provide consent and the respective consequences, when applicable.
Withdrawal of your consent. You have the right to withdraw your consent. This procedure will be carried out free of charge.
Request a review of decisions made solely based on automated processing of personal data.
Please keep in mind that these rights are not absolute and may not apply in certain circumstances. For example, in certain cases we may continue to process and retain data regardless of your request for deletion, objection, blocking or anonymisation, in order to comply with legal, contractual and regulatory obligations, safeguard and exercise rights, including in judicial, administrative and arbitration proceedings and in other cases provided for by law.
International Data Transfers. You acknowledge that Anthropic is a company based and headquartered in the United States. Any information we hold about you will be transferred to, used, processed, and stored in the United States and other countries and territories, which may not have data privacy or data protection laws equivalent to those in your country or territory. For the proper operation of the Services, Anthropic needs to carry out international transfers of personal data. In the case of Brazil, we will rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for our data transfers where required and in instances where they are not covered by an adequacy decision. These SCCs have been approved by the Brazilian Data Protection Authority (ANPD), which is the "competent supervisory authority" for these transfers, as governed by Brazilian Data Protection Laws.

Introduction
AppsFlyer provides attribution and marketing analytics services (“
Services
“) that enable advertisers and developers (collectively, “
Customer(s)
“) to: (i) measure and analyze the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by understanding which marketing campaigns contributed to the download/installation of their mobile applications (“
Applications
“) or such other conversion metric (e.g. relaunch of Application); and (ii) measure and analyze certain events and actions within their Application or websites, such as in-app purchases made by End Users (as defined below). The Services also help our Customers identify and protect against fraudulent behavior related to their marketing campaigns.
This Services Privacy Policy describes AppsFlyer’s privacy practices in relation to the information collected from Customers and End Users and received by AppsFlyer when Customers use our Services. This Services Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through use of AppsFlyer’s publicly accessible website or marketing activities, which is described under our Privacy Policy. To view the Privacy Policy, please
click here
. Furthermore, AppsFlyer and its Customers have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by AppsFlyer and their use by Customers (“
Agreement(s)
“). Such Agreements may contain additional obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information. Nothing in this Services Privacy Policy derogates from such additional obligations.
For the purpose of this Services Privacy Policy: (i) any reference to “
End User(s)
” means end users who have interacted with, or viewed, Customer’s advertising and marketing materials, or use or have used Customer’s Applications, websites, products and services; and (ii) any reference to “
AppsFlyer
” “
we
” “
us
” or “
our
” shall mean AppsFlyer Ltd. and its affiliates.
End User Data Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer uses the Services, the following End User information may be received and processed by AppsFlyer (collectively, “
End User Data
”).
“
Technical Information
”: this refers to technical information related to an End User’s mobile device or computer, such as: browser type, device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.
“
Technical Identifiers
”: this refers to various unique identifiers that generally only identify a computer, device, browser or Application. For example, IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices); Google Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique identifiers.
“
Engagement Information
”: this refers to information relating to the Customer’s ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer’s website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyze within their Application or website (e.g. add to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).
While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information (“
PII
“), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such. Within the scope of the engagement between Customers and AppsFlyer, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by AppsFlyer. However, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII. This includes, for example, a Customer using an End User’s email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier. If a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.
Registration Information Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer registers to use the Services, we may collect certain information related to such Customer (“
Registration Information
” and together with the End User Data, “
Customer Data
”), including Customer name and Customer details, billing information and names and contact details of Customer employees and representatives who are using the Services (e.g. email, phone number and address). When a Customer uses the Services, AppsFlyer may also collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Customer is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g. browser type, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Customer (“
Log Data
”).
How Data is Collected
Customer Data may be collected through various methods, including:
When provided voluntarily (e.g. Customer’s Registration Information).
When the Customer integrates AppsFlyer’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Applications, websites and/or ads (“
Collection Technologies
”). For explanations on cookies and similar technologies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Customer in connection with the measurement and analysis of Customer’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with AppsFlyer (“
Partners
”).
How Data is Used by AppsFlyer
When AppsFlyer receives End User Data from a Customer, it uses such End User Data as follows:
to provide such Customer with the Services they have subscribed for. Such services may include, without limitation, attribution, analytics and ad fraud protection services. Please visit
https://www.appsflyer.com
for more information regarding the Services.
to establish: (i) matches between devices used by an End User; and (ii) to detect fraud (such matched data and fraud data, collectively, the, “
Platform Data
”) in order to ensure more accurate attribution measurement and ad fraud protection for Customers using the Services. Platform Data does not contain PII such as End User names, physical addresses, phone numbers or other similar personal data that can directly identify an individual.
With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, we use such information to authenticate login to the Services, to communicate with the Customer and to process any payments in connection with the Services. Additionally, we may use: (i) Registration Information to inform Customers of any updates to the Services, including new features and functionalities; and (ii) Log Data to understand how Customers are using the Services so that we may efficiently audit, maintain and improve the Services provided to Customers.
AppsFlyer may use information derived from the aggregation of End User Data and/or Log Data with other data for research and analytics purposes and improvement and marketing of the Services (“
Aggregated Data
”). Aggregated Data shall be anonymous and in no way reveal the identity of the Customer or any End User.
Sharing Data
AppsFlyer does not share or disclose Customer Data with any third party, except:
Upon our Customer’s request– (e.g. to Partners);
To our subsidiaries and global branches as necessary to help us support and maintain the Services provided to Customers;
To our service providers who help to support our Services – such as data hosting providers and payment processors; Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
When legally required (e.g. court orders or other lawful requests by public authorities), including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
To respond to, or prevent, fraud or to protect the safety of AppsFlyer, its Customers, End Users or the public;
As part of any merger or acquisition of AppsFlyer, in which case End User Data may be transferred to the surviving or acquiring entity.
Cross Border Data Transfers
AppsFlyer may need to transfer Customer Data to countries other than the country from which the Data originated. Any such transfer shall be done in compliance with all applicable laws. With regards to the collection, use and retention of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States, please be assured that AppsFlyer continues to comply with all applicable laws in respect of such transfers and any data transfers to the United States will be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses as set forth in our DPA with the relevant service provider.
Protecting Data and Retention
AppsFlyer implements appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction or damage of Customer Data. For more information on our security controls, please see
https://www.appsflyer.com/trust/security/
. If you have questions about the security of your personal information, or if you have reason to believe that the personal information that we hold about you is no longer secure, please contact us immediately as described in this Services Privacy Policy.
AppsFlyer will not retain: (i) End User Data for more than twenty-four months except where otherwise directed by Customers or required or allowed by law; and (ii) Registration Information, Log Data or Platform Data for more time than is needed to serve the legitimate business need for which it was collected.
Relationship, Lawful Basis and End User Choices
Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, when processing End User Data in connection with the provision of Services to a Customer, AppsFlyer is deemed a ‘data processor’ while its Customers are deemed ‘data controllers’.
Therefore, End Users should closely review the Privacy Policies of the Applications and websites they use in order to learn about the privacy practices of our Customers.
Where AppsFlyer may be deemed a data controller under the laws of certain jurisdictions (e.g. in connection with its processing of Log Data or Registration Information), AppsFlyer shall comply with all applicable laws related to its status as a data controller and shall only use the data as described in this Services Privacy Policy. With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, the lawful basis AppsFlyer relies on is its need to perform its obligations under the Agreement between AppsFlyer and Customer and on its legitimate interests to maintain, analyze and improve the Services. The laws of certain jurisdictions may provide End Users with various rights in connection with the processing of End User Data, including:
The right to withdraw any previously provided consent;
The right to access certain information about you that we process;
The right to have us correct or update any Personal Information;
The right to have certain Information erased;
The right to have us temporarily block our processing of certain Information;
The right to have Information exported into common machine-readable format;
The right to object to our processing of Information in cases of direct marketing, or when we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis to process your information; and
The right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority.
Where AppsFlyer is deemed a data processor, End Users should contact our Customers to pursue any such legal data subject rights. AppsFlyer will cooperate with its Customers to support and comply with any such data subject rights requests.
Where AppsFlyer is deemed a data controller, End Users may exercise their rights by contacting AppsFlyer at:
privacy@appsflyer.com
. We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe. Please note these rights may be limited in certain circumstances as provided by applicable law. In any event, AppsFlyer provides End Users with the ability to opt-out of being measured by the Services by emailing a request to
privacy@appsflyer.com

THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING
We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted
advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies
and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our online services over time so that they may
play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use.
Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking
technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology,
which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time
and date you visited the Sites, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We may share a common account
identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you
across devices. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more
relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics
and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve
targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or
other information to the platform provider.
We may engage in the following:
Social Media Platforms.
We may display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as
Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, and other social media forums. These companies have interest-based
advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while
those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely
commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address,
with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel,
in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These
advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not
want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through
your settings on those networks.
Third Party Partners
. We work with a variety of third-party partners to provide advertising services. For example,
we may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics. These
features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as
the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based
on your past visits to the Services. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google
advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available
at
https://google.com/ads/preferences
, or by visiting NAI’s online
resources at
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices
.
Please see the
Online Ads
section of the
Control Over Your Information
section below to learn how you can opt
out of interest-based advertising.
CONTROL OVER YOUR INFORMATION
You may control your information in the following ways:
Email Communications Preferences.
From time to time, we may also send you emails regarding updates to our Service,
products or services, notices about our organization, or information about products/services that we think may be of
interest to you. If you wish to unsubscribe from such emails, simply click the “unsubscribe link” provided at the
bottom of the email communication. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain services-related email communications
(e.g., account verification, confirmations of transactions, technical or legal notices).
Modifying or Deleting Your Information.
If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting your
information, you can contact us directly using the information provided in the
Contact Us
section, below. We will
review your request and may require you to provide additional information to identify yourself. We may not be able to
modify or delete your information in all circumstances.
Online Ads
. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this
advertising, you may wish to visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) resources and/or the Network Advertising
Initiative’s (NAI) online resources, at
www.aboutads.info/choices
or
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices
. You may also be able to limit
interest-based advertising through the settings menu on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or
“opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). You may also be able to opt-out of some, but not all, interest-based
advertising served by mobile ad networks by visiting
http://youradchoices.com/appchoices
and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.
Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see
advertisements from us or on our online services. It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program
participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with,
any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In
addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including
for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.
CHILDREN’S PERSONAL DATA
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal data from children
under the age of 13. If an individual is under the age of 13, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us
with any personal data either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to
us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal data from our
systems.
If we learn that any personal data we have collected has been provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly
delete that personal data.
LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES
Our Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications that we do not own or operate. We are
not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from the services, including the
information or content contained within them. Our Privacy Notice does not apply to your browsing or other interactions
on any other website or service. Activities on third party websites or services are subject to that applicable third
party’s rules and policies, not ours. If you are using a third-party website or service, you do so at your own risk. We
encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site or service before providing any personal data.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice from time to time at our sole discretion. We will notify you about
material changes in the way we treat personal data by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your
Fireworks account and/or by placing a prominent notice on our website. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy
Notice periodically. When we do change the Privacy Notice, we will also revise the “Last Updated” date.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google

And finally, you can also
request to remove content

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

specific Google services

Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods

A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.

A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide our Services and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing our Services and enhancing their safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defense of legal claims.
The retention periods will be different depending on the amount, type and sensitivity of information, the purposes for which we use the information and any legal requirements, etc. For example, when we process your information to provide you with the Services, we keep this information for as long as you have an account.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO

certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
