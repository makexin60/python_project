The Lyft Platform
The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where, among other things, persons who seek
                        transportation to certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to
                        such destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are
                        driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers, Riders, and any other
                        individuals, excluding any Excluded Individuals, using the Lyft Platform are collectively
                        referred to herein as “Users.” The driving services provided (a) by Drivers to Riders (including
                        other transportation related services provided by Drivers), or (b) by means of autonomous
                        vehicles (“Autonomous Vehicles” or “AVs”), in connection with the Lyft Platform, shall
                        collectively be referred to herein as “Rideshare Services” and the providers thereof “Rideshare
                        Providers.” “Lyft Services” shall include any service provided by Lyft pursuant to the Lyft
                        Platform (for clarity, Lyft Services does not include Rideshare Services or Third-Party
                        Services). As a User, you authorize Lyft to match and/or re-match you with Drivers or Riders or
                        AVs based on factors such as your location, the requested pickup location, the estimated time to
                        pickup, your destination, User preferences, ride mode, driver mode, applicable vehicle
                        requirements, membership status, regulatory or other third-party requirements, user statistics,
                        and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match based on the same or other
                        considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a decision made
                        in such User’s sole discretion. A separate agreement is formed between Drivers and Riders when
                        the Rider accepts the offered Rideshare Services. As used herein, “Excluded Individuals” means
                        any individual who is registering to use the Lyft Platform or whose use of the Lyft Platform is
                        on behalf of an organization contracted with Lyft, except as a Rider or Driver.
In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent transportation modalities (e.g., bikes,
                        scooters, cars, etc.) or be offered other services through the Lyft Platform. In some markets,
                        some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned and operated by Lyft. In other
                        markets, some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned or operated by third
                        parties.
In any case, your use of Lyft Services through the Lyft Platform may be subject to additional
                        agreements between you and Lyft as applicable to the particular service in the particular market
                        (“Supplemental Agreements”). Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT,
                            YOU MAY NOT RENT OR USE LYFT SERVICES IN SUCH MARKET.
In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any
                        Supplemental Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control, unless such Supplemental
                        Agreement specifically states otherwise.
Modification to the Agreement
Lyft reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including by
                        changing or deleting existing terms or by adding new ones, and such modifications shall be
                        binding on you upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Continued use of the Lyft
                        Platform after modifications to this Agreement shall constitute your acceptance of such
                        modifications. Drivers or driver applicants, however, may opt out of revisions to the
                        Agreement’s arbitration provisions with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17
                        below. Lyft reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks
                        from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon
                        posting. Continued use of the Lyft Platform after modifications to any information on pages
                        referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement shall constitute your acceptance of such
                        modifications.
Eligibility
The Lyft Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and authority to enter into
                        this Agreement and are fully able and competent to satisfy the terms, conditions, and
                        obligations herein. The Lyft Platform is not available to Users who have had their User account
                        temporarily or permanently deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User
                        account, you agree that you are the sole authorized user of your User account, and you may not
                        use your User account on behalf of any third party, except as otherwise expressly permitted by
                        Lyft. To use the Lyft Platform, each User shall create a User account. Each person may only
                        create one User account, and Lyft reserves the right to deactivate any additional or duplicate
                        accounts. Your participation in certain Lyft programs and use of certain Lyft services may be
                        subject to additional eligibility requirements as determined by Lyft.
By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are the parent or legal guardian of a 16 or 17-year old
                        minor you may create a User account for such minor to use the Lyft Platform subject to the
                        following requirements and restrictions: (a) you ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft
                        Platform is limited solely to accessing and using Lyft Services and/or Third-Party Services
                        where expressly permitted under the Supplemental Agreement applicable to such Lyft Services
                        and/or Third-Party Services, (b) you determine that the Lyft Services and/or Third-Party
                        Services are suitable for the minor, (c) you ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform
                        and applicable Lyft Services and/or Third-Party Services is done in compliance and
                        acknowledgement of all applicable safety instructions and warnings in this Agreement, any
                        applicable Supplemental Agreements, and the Lyft Platform, (d) you ensure that the minor does
                        not request or accept any Rideshare Services unless accompanied by you or an authorized
                        guardian, and (e) you explain the terms of this Agreement to the minor. For clarity, no
                        unaccompanied User under 18 years old may ride in an Autonomous Vehicle.
By creating a User account for such minor, you hereby give permission and consent to the
                        Agreement on the minor’s behalf, you expressly guarantee the minor’s acceptance, and your own
                        acceptance, of the terms of this Agreement, and you shall assume any and all responsibility and
                        liability for the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform as provided by the terms of this Agreement
                        and any applicable Supplemental Agreements. You will be responsible for any breach of the above
                        representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any attempt of the minor to disaffirm
                        this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent that you are fully authorized to execute this
                        Agreement on behalf of yourself and all other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.
Charges
As a User, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services, Lyft Services, or
                        Third-Party Services may result in charges (“Charges”) to you and/or to an organization, if
                        applicable. Charges to Riders and/or organizations, if applicable, for Rideshare Services
                        include Fares (defined below) and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes, including
                        as set forth on your market’s
Lyft Cities page
(“Lyft
                        Cities Page”), plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and
                        reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your
                        market’s Lyft Cities Page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a
                        request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., economy, extra seats,
                        luxury) as described on your market’s Lyft Cities Page or within the Lyft Platform. You are
                        responsible for reviewing the applicable Lyft Cities Page or price quote within the Lyft
                        Platform and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account regardless of
                        your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
Rideshare Service Fares (“Fares”). There are two types of Fares, quoted and variable.
Quoted Fares
. When you make a ride request using the Lyft Platform, Lyft
                            will quote you a Fare at the time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the
                            ride request is confirmed. If your final destination is not the same as the destination in
                            your ride request, or the time and/or distance of your ride differs substantially from your
                            quoted fare, or if you attempt to abuse the Lyft Platform, we may, at Lyft’s sole discretion
                            and determination, cancel the fare quote and charge you a variable fare as described below.
                            Lyft does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare for the
                            same ride. Quoted fares may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as
                            applicable.
Variable Fares
. Variable fares consist of a base charge and incremental
                            charges based on the time and distance of your ride. For particularly short rides, minimum
                            fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS data from your Rideshare Provider’s device to
                            calculate the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee the availability or
                            accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal, we will calculate time and distance using available
                            data from your ride. In addition to the variable fare, the total cost of your ride may
                            include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as applicable.
Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges.
Service Fee
. Lyft may charge a “Service Fee” for each ride, as set forth on
                            the applicable Lyft Cities Page.
Prime Time
. At certain times, including times of high demand for Rideshare
                            Services (“Prime Time”), you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For quoted
                            fares, we may factor Prime Time increases into the quoted price of the ride.
Priority Pickup and Wait & Save
. In some cases, you may be able to select
                            an expected pick up that is faster or slower than standard for a higher or lower Fare,
                            respectively.
Cancellation Fee
. After requesting a ride you may cancel it through the
                            Lyft Platform, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply. Lyft may also
                            charge a fee if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please check out our Help
                            Center to learn more about
Lyft’s rider cancellation policy
.
Damage Fee
. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the
                            Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250 depending on the extent of
                            the damage (as determined by Lyft in its sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or
                            cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require
                            documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee.
Abuse Fee
. If we receive a credible report that you have misused or abused
                            the Lyft Platform, you agree to pay an “Abuse Fee” of up to $250 as determined by Lyft in
                            its sole discretion. Lyft reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise
                            require documentation of abuse prior to processing the Abuse Fee.
Tolls
. In some instances tolls, toll estimates, and/or return tolls may
                            apply to your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market’s Lyft Cities Page for more
                            information about toll charges. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Lyft will
                            match the toll charged to the Rideshare Provider, if any.
Other Charges
. Other fees and surcharges may apply to your ride, including
                            but not limited to: actual or anticipated airport fees, state fees, local fees, event fees,
                            fuel surcharges, wait time fees, or distance surcharges as determined by Lyft or its
                            marketing partners. In addition, where required by law Lyft will collect applicable taxes.
                            See your market’s Lyft Cities Page for information on other Charges that may apply to your
                            ride.
Tips
. Following a ride, you may have the opportunity to elect to tip your
                            Driver in cash or through the Lyft Platform. You may also elect to set a default tip amount
                            or percentage through the Lyft Platform. Any tips will be provided entirely to the
                            applicable Driver.
Charges Generally.
Facilitation of Charges
. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party
                            payment processor (First Data, Stripe, Inc., Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc., etc.).
                            Lyft may replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you. With the exception
                            of tips and the purchase of Lyft Cash, cash payments are strictly prohibited unless
                            expressly permitted by Lyft. Your payment of Charges to Lyft satisfies your payment
                            obligation for your use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, and
                            Rideshare Services. Certain Charges may be collectively billed as a single purchase
                            transaction to your selected payment method based on the payment frequency indicated in your
                            settings. If your primary payment method expires, is invalid, or if Charges to your primary
                            payment method are unable to be processed for whatever reason, then you agree that Lyft may
                            charge your other available payment methods in the Lyft Platform. If you don't recognize a
                            transaction, then check your ride receipts and payment history.
No Refunds
. All Charges are non-refundable except to the extent required by
                            law. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate
                            usage of the Lyft Platform, any disruption to the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party
                            Services, or Rideshare Services, or any other reason whatsoever.
Coupons
. You may receive coupons, credits, discounts, or other promotions
                            (collectively, “Coupons”) that you can apply toward payment of certain Charges. Coupons are
                            valid only for use on the Lyft Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash
                            except as required by law. Coupons cannot be combined unless expressly provided otherwise,
                            and if the cost of your Charges exceeds the applicable Coupon value, we may charge your
                            payment method on file for the Charges in excess of the Coupon amount. With respect to
                            Fares, Lyft may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee, Tolls, or Other Charges
                            before application of the Coupon. Additional restrictions on Coupons may apply as
                            communicated to you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant Coupon within the
                            Rewards section of the Lyft Platform.
Supplemental Charges
. Charges related to Lyft Services (including the
                            rental of bikes and scooters) may be further detailed in the applicable Supplemental
                            Agreement.
Third-Party Charges
. If you choose to purchase Third-Party Services
                            (described further in Section 21) through the Lyft Platform, you authorize your payment
                            method on file to be charged according to the pricing terms set by Lyft or the third-party
                            provider, or as otherwise provided in the terms of the purchased services.
Payment Card Authorization
. Upon addition of a new payment method or each
                            request for Lyft Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services, Lyft may seek
                            authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the
                            Charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not
                            a charge; however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until
                            your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total
                            funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank
                            issuing your debit or prepaid card. Lyft is not responsible for these charges and is unable
                            to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to learn
                            more about
our use of pre-authorization holds

For clarity, Lyft does not charge a fee for Users to access the Lyft Platform, but retains the
                        right to charge Users and/or organizations, if applicable, a fee or any other Charge for
                        accessing or using Lyft Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services made available
                        through the Lyft Platform.
Driver Payments
If you are a Driver, you will receive payment for your provision of Rideshare Services pursuant
                        to the terms of the
Driver Addendum
, which shall form part
                        of this Agreement between you and Lyft.
Lyft Communications
By entering into this Agreement or using the Lyft Platform, you agree to receive communications
                        from us, our affiliates, or our third-party partners, at any of the phone numbers provided to
                        Lyft by you or on your behalf, and also via emails, text messages, calls, and push notifications
                        at any time (including between the hours of 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., local time). You agree that
                        texts, calls or prerecorded messages may be generated by automatic telephone dialing systems.
                        Communications from Lyft, its affiliated companies and/or Rideshare Providers may include but
                        are not limited to: operational communications concerning your User account or use of the Lyft
                        Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services or Rideshare Services, payment receipts, payment
                        reminders or processing issues, updates concerning new and existing features on the Lyft

                        program terms or this Agreement. Lyft reserves the right to terminate, discontinue, modify or
                        cancel any promotions or programs at any time and in its sole discretion without notice to you.

You own, or have the legal right to operate, the vehicle you use when providing Rideshare
                            Services; such vehicle is in good operating condition and meets the industry safety
                            standards and all applicable statutory and state and local requirements for a vehicle of its
                            kind; such vehicle meets the applicable requirements of the Lyft Platform; and any and all
                            applicable safety recalls have been or will be remedied per manufacturer instructions.

                            Services, operate a vehicle that is unsafe to drive, drive or operate a vehicle in an unsafe

You will only provide Rideshare Services using the vehicle that has been reported to, and
                            approved by Lyft, and you will not transport more passengers than can securely be seated in
                            such vehicle (and no more than seven (7) passengers in any instance).
You will not, while providing the Rideshare Services, operate as a public or common carrier
                            or taxi service, accept street hails, charge for rides (except as expressly provided in this

                            with your obligations under this Agreement.
You will not attempt to defraud Lyft or Riders on the Lyft Platform or in connection with
                            your provision of Rideshare Services. If we suspect that you have engaged in fraudulent
                            activity we may withhold applicable Fares or other payments for the ride(s) in question and
                            take any other action against you available under this Agreement and/or the law.

Service Animal Policy
and
Wheelchair Policy
for Riders who travel with their service animals or who use wheelchairs (or other mobility
                            devices) that can be folded for safe and secure storage in the car’s trunk or backseat.
You agree that we may obtain information about you, including your criminal and driving
                            records, and you agree to provide any further necessary authorizations to facilitate our
                            access to such records during the term of the Agreement.

                            applicable legal requirements) that names or schedules you for the operation of the vehicle
                            you use to provide Rideshare Services, and you agree to provide proof of such insurance and
                            that information regarding such insurance may be released to Lyft upon Lyft’s reasonable
                            request.
You understand that providing Rideshare Services to unaccompanied persons under the age of
                            18 is prohibited, and you will cancel any ride involving an unaccompanied person under the
                            age of 18.
If you are a professionally licensed or permitted Driver providing Rideshare Services on the
                            Lyft Platform, you have or are subject to a valid commercial automobile insurance policy
                            that meets all applicable requirements.

                            Rideshare Services and any payments received by you.
You will comply with Lyft’s reasonable requests to provide information in connection with
                            Rider complaints, law enforcement requests, or any other incident.

                        of their respective owners. You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions,
                        ideas, feedback or other information (“Submissions”) provided by you or on your behalf to us are
                        non-confidential and shall become the sole property of Lyft. Lyft shall own exclusive rights,
                        including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and
                        dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without

                        intellectual property rights.
LYFT and other Lyft logos, designs, graphics, icons, scripts and service names are registered
                        trademarks, trademarks or trade dress of Lyft in the United States and/or other countries
                        (collectively, the “Lyft Marks”). If you provide Rideshare Services as a Driver, Lyft grants to
                        you, during the term of this Agreement, and subject to your compliance with the terms and
                        conditions of this Agreement, a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to display and use the
                        Lyft Marks solely on the Lyft stickers/decals, and any other Lyft-branded items provided by Lyft
                        directly to you in connection with providing the Rideshare Services (“License”). The License is
                        non-transferable and non-assignable, and you shall not grant to any third party any right,
                        permission, license or sublicense with respect to any of the rights granted hereunder without
                        Lyft’s prior written permission, which it may withhold in its sole discretion. The Lyft logo (or
                        any Lyft Marks) may not be used in any manner that is likely to cause confusion, including but
                        not limited to: use of a Lyft Mark in a domain name or Lyft referral code, or use of a Lyft Mark
                        as a social media handle or name, avatar, profile photo, icon, favicon, or banner. You may
                        identify yourself as a Driver on the Lyft Platform, but may not misidentify yourself as Lyft, an
                        employee of Lyft, or a representative or agent of Lyft.
You acknowledge that Lyft is the owner and licensor of the Lyft Marks, including all goodwill
                        associated therewith, and that your use of the Lyft logo (or any Lyft Marks) will confer no
                        interest in or ownership of the Lyft Marks in you but rather inures to the benefit of Lyft. You
                        agree to use the Lyft logo strictly in accordance with Lyft’s Brand Guidelines, as may be
                        provided to you and revised from time to time, and to immediately cease any use that Lyft
                        determines to be nonconforming or otherwise unacceptable.
You agree that you will not: (1) create any materials that use the Lyft Marks or any derivatives
                        of the Lyft Marks as a trademark, service mark, trade name or trade dress, other than as
                        expressly approved by Lyft in writing; (2) use the Lyft Marks in any way that tends to impair
                        their validity as proprietary trademarks, service marks, trade names or trade dress, or use the
                        Lyft Marks other than in accordance with the terms, conditions and restrictions herein; (3) take
                        any other action that would jeopardize or impair Lyft’s rights as owner of the Lyft Marks or the
                        legality and/or enforceability of the Lyft Marks, including challenging or opposing Lyft’s
                        ownership in the Lyft Marks; (4) apply for trademark registration or renewal of trademark
                        registration of any of the Lyft Marks, any derivative of the Lyft Marks, any combination of the
                        Lyft Marks and any other name, or any trademark, service mark, trade name, symbol or word which
                        is similar to the Lyft Marks; (5) use the Lyft Marks on or in connection with any product,
                        service or activity that is in violation of any law, statute, government regulation or standard.
You agree you will not rent, lease, lend, sell, or otherwise redistribute the Lyft driver Amp or
                        Glow, or manufacture, produce, print, sell, distribute, purchase, or display
                        counterfeit/inauthentic Lyft driver Amps, Glows, or other Lyft Marks or (including but not
                        limited to signage, stickers, apparel, or decals) from any source other than directly from Lyft.
Violation of any provision of this License may result in immediate termination of the License,
                        in Lyft’s sole discretion, a takedown request sent to the appropriate ISP, or social media
                        platform, and/or a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy Proceeding (or equivalent
                        proceeding). If you create any materials (physical or digital) bearing the Lyft Marks (in
                        violation of this Agreement or otherwise), you agree that upon their creation Lyft exclusively
                        owns all right, title and interest in and to such materials, including any modifications to the
                        Lyft Marks or derivative works based on the Lyft Marks or Lyft copyrights. You hereby assign any
                        interest or right you may have in such materials to Lyft, and shall provide information and
                        execute any documents as reasonably requested by Lyft to enable Lyft to formalize such
                        assignment.
Lyft respects the intellectual property of others, and expects Users to do the same. If you
                        believe, in good faith, that any materials on the Lyft Platform infringe upon your copyrights,

                        successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and
                        shareholders.
Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation carrier. Lyft is
                        not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Rideshare Provider to decide whether or
                        not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through the Lyft Platform, and it is up to the Rider to
                        decide whether or not to accept a ride from any Rideshare Provider contacted through the Lyft
                        Platform. We cannot ensure that a Rideshare Provider or Rider will complete an arranged
                        transportation service. We have no control over the quality or safety of the transportation that
                        occurs as a result of the Rideshare Services. Any safety-related feature, process, policy,
                        standard, or other effort undertaken by Lyft is not an indication of any employment or agency
                        relationship with any User.
The Lyft Platform is provided on an “as is” basis and without any warranty or condition,
                        express, implied or statutory. We do not guarantee and do not promise any specific results from
                        use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, and/or the Rideshare Services,
                        including the ability to provide or receive Rideshare Services at any given location or time.
                        Lyft reserves the right, for example, to limit or eliminate access to the Lyft Platform for
                        Rideshare Services, Third-Party Services, and/or Lyft Services in specific geographic areas
                        and/or at specific times based on commercial viability, public health concerns, or changes in
                        law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties of
                        title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Some states do
                        not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to
                        you.
We do not warrant that your use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, or
                        Rideshare Services will be accurate, complete, reliable, current, secure, uninterrupted, always
                        available, or error-free, or will meet your requirements, that any defects in the Lyft Platform
                        will be corrected, or that the Lyft Platform is free of viruses or other harmful components. We
                        disclaim liability for, and no warranty is made with respect to, connectivity, availability,
                        accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party
                        Services, or Rideshare Services, including with respect to mapping, navigation, estimated times
                        of arrival, and routing services. You are responsible at all times for your conduct and the
                        consequences of your conduct while using the Lyft Platform.
We cannot guarantee that each Rider or Driver is who he or she claims to be. Please use common
                        sense when using the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, and Rideshare Services,
                        including looking at the photos of the Driver or Rider you have matched with to make sure it is
                        the same individual you see in person. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with
                        underage persons or people acting under false pretense, and we do not accept responsibility or
                        liability for any content, communication or other use or access of the Lyft Platform by persons
                        under the age of 18 in violation of this Agreement. We encourage you to communicate directly
                        with each potential Driver or Rider prior to engaging in an arranged transportation service.
Lyft is not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any User of the Lyft
                        Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services. You are solely responsible
                        for your interactions with other Users. We do not procure insurance for, nor are we responsible
                        for, personal belongings left in the car by Drivers or Riders. By using the Lyft Platform, Lyft
                        Services, Third-Party Services, and participating in the Rideshare Services, you agree to accept
                        such risks and agree that Lyft is not responsible for the acts or omissions of Users on the Lyft
                        Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, or participating in the Rideshare Services.
You are responsible for the use of your User account and Lyft expressly disclaims any liability
                        arising from the unauthorized use of your User account.
It is possible for others to obtain information about you that you provide, publish or post to
                        or through the Lyft Platform (including any profile information you provide), send to other
                        Users, or share during the Rideshare Services, and to use such information to harass or harm
                        you. We are not responsible for the use of any personal information that you disclose to other
                        Users on the Lyft Platform or through the Rideshare Services, Lyft Services, or Third-Party
                        Services. Please carefully select the type of information that you post on the Lyft Platform or
                        through the Rideshare Services, Lyft Services, or Third-Party Services or release to others. We
                        disclaim all liability, regardless of the form of action, for the acts or omissions of other
                        Users (including unauthorized users, or “hackers”).
Opinions, advice, statements, offers, or other information or content concerning Lyft or made
                        available through the Lyft Platform, but not directly by us, are those of their respective
                        authors, and should not necessarily be relied upon. Such authors are solely responsible for such
                        content. Under no circumstances will we be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from
                        your reliance on information or other content posted by third parties, whether on the Lyft
                        Platform or otherwise. We reserve the right, but we have no obligation, to monitor the materials
                        posted on the Lyft Platform and remove any such material that in our sole opinion violates, or
                        is alleged to violate, the law or this Agreement or which might be offensive, illegal, or that
                        might violate the rights of, harm, or threaten the safety of Users or others.
Location data provided by the Lyft Platform is for basic location purposes only and is not
                        intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where
                        erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, or
                        property or environmental damage. Neither Lyft, nor any of its content providers, guarantees the
                        availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data tracked or
                        displayed by the Lyft Platform. Any of your Information, including geolocational data, you
                        upload, provide, or post on the Lyft Platform may be accessible to Lyft and certain Users of the
                        Lyft Platform.
Lyft advises you to use the Lyft Platform with a data plan with unlimited or very high data
                        usage limits, and Lyft shall not be responsible or liable for any fees, costs, or overage
                        charges associated with any data plan you use to access the Lyft Platform.
This paragraph applies to any version of the Lyft Platform that you acquire from the Apple App
                        Store. This Agreement is entered into between you and Lyft. Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) is not a party
                        to this Agreement and shall have no obligations with respect to the Lyft Platform. Lyft, not
                        Apple, is solely responsible for the Lyft Platform and the content thereof as set forth
                        hereunder. However, Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this
                        Agreement. Upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple shall have the right (and will be
                        deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party
                        beneficiary thereof. This Agreement incorporates by reference
Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement
, for purposes of which, you are “the end-user.” In the event of a conflict in the terms of the
                        Licensed Application End User License Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
                        shall control.
As a Driver, you may be able to use "Lyft Nav built by Google" while providing Rideshare
                        Services on the Lyft Platform. Riders and Drivers may also use Google Maps while using the Lyft
                        Platform. In either case, you agree that Google may collect your location data when the Lyft
                        Platform is running in order to provide and improve Google's services, that such data may also
                        be shared with Lyft in order to improve its operations, and that Google's
terms
and
privacy policy
will apply to
                        this usage.
As a Rider seeking Rideshare Services on the Lyft Platform, you may be matched with a
                        professionally licensed or otherwise permitted Rideshare Provider who may be subject to state
                        and local regulations, including requirements to carry commercial automobile insurance. Subject
                        to applicable law, in select markets, Lyft may not provide insurance coverage for instances of
                        Rideshare Services provided by these professionally licensed or otherwise permitted Rideshare
                        Providers.
Lyft shall not be in breach of this Agreement nor liable for failure or delay in performing
                        obligations under this Agreement if such failure or delay results from events, circumstances or
                        causes beyond its reasonable control including (without limitation) natural disasters or acts of
                        God; labor disputes or stoppages; war; government action; epidemic or pandemic; chemical or
                        biological contamination; strikes; riots; acts of domestic or international terrorism;
                        quarantines; national or regional emergencies; or any other cause, whether similar in kind to
                        the foregoing or otherwise, beyond the party’s reasonable control. All service dates under this
                        Agreement affected by force majeure shall be tolled for the duration of such force majeure. The
                        parties hereby agree, when feasible, not to cancel but reschedule the pertinent obligations as
                        soon as practicable after the force majeure condition ceases to exist.
State and Local Disclosures
Certain jurisdictions require additional disclosures to you, such as requirements for drivers,
                        earnings information, and where you can access Lyft’s certificates of insurance. You can view
                        any disclosures required by your local jurisdiction at
www.lyft.com/terms/disclosures
. By
                        accepting this Agreement, you acknowledge that Lyft has provided these disclosures to you and
                        that you have read them. Please check regularly for updates.
Indemnity
You will indemnify and hold harmless and, at Lyft’s election, defend Lyft including our
                        affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers,

                        that any materials or Information that you submit to us or transmit through the Lyft Platform or
                        to us infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates the copyright, trademark, trade secret
                        or other intellectual property or other rights of any third party; (4) your ownership, use or
                        operation of a motor vehicle or passenger vehicle, including your provision of Rideshare

                        without regard to the negligence of any party, including any indemnified person. You will not,
                        without Lyft’s prior written consent, agree to any settlement on behalf of any Indemnified Party
                        which includes either the obligation to pay any monetary amounts, or any admissions of
                        liability, whether civil or criminal, on the part of any Indemnified Party.
Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL LYFT, INCLUDING OUR AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, PARENTS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS,
                        AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SHAREHOLDERS (COLLECTIVELY

                        PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR DELETION, CORRUPTION, LOSS
                        OF DATA, LOSS OF PROGRAMS, FAILURE TO STORE ANY INFORMATION OR OTHER CONTENT MAINTAINED OR
                        TRANSMITTED BY THE LYFT PLATFORM, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, OR FOR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
                        SUBSTITUTE SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LYFT PLATFORM, LYFT SERVICES, THE
                        RIDESHARE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER ARISING INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF WE OR OUR
                        AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE LYFT
                        PLATFORM MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE TRANSPORTATION, GOODS, OR THIRD-PARTY
                        SERVICES WITH THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT LYFT HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY
                        TO YOU RELATED TO ANY TRANSPORTATION, GOODS, OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES SET FORTH IN THIS
                        AGREEMENT. FOR CLARITY AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, LYFT HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR
                        LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON

                        DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.
Term and Termination
This Agreement is effective upon your acceptance of this Agreement. This Agreement may be
                        terminated: (a) by User, without cause, upon seven (7) days’ prior written notice to Lyft; or
                        (b) by either party immediately, without notice, upon the other party’s material breach of this
                        Agreement, including but not limited to any breach of Section 9 or breach of Section 10(a)-(i)
                        of this Agreement. In addition, Lyft may terminate this Agreement or deactivate your User
                        account or cease offering or deny access to Lyft services or any portion thereof immediately in
                        the event: (1) you are no longer eligible to qualify as a User; (2) you no longer qualify to
                        provide Rideshare Services or to operate the approved vehicle under applicable law, rule,
                        permit, ordinance or regulation; (3) you fall below Lyft’s star rating threshold; or (4) Lyft
                        has the good faith belief that such action is necessary to protect the safety of the Lyft
                        community or third parties, provided that in the event of a deactivation pursuant to (1)-(4)
                        above, you will be given notice of the potential or actual deactivation and an opportunity to
                        attempt to cure the issue to Lyft’s reasonable satisfaction prior to Lyft permanently
                        terminating the Agreement. For all other breaches of this Agreement, you will be provided notice
                        and an opportunity to cure the breach. If the breach is cured in a timely manner and to Lyft’s
                        satisfaction, this Agreement will not be permanently terminated. Sections 2, 6, 7 (with respect
                        to the license), 11-12, and 14-22 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement
(a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Lyft.
YOU AND LYFT MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT
                        OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY ARBITRATION, as set forth below.
                        This agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
                        (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, including both the FAA’s procedural and substantive provisions. If
                        the FAA is inapplicable for any reason, then this Arbitration Agreement is governed by the laws
                        of the State of Delaware, including the procedural and substantive provisions of Del. Code tit.
                        10, § 5701 et seq., without regard to choice of law principles. For the avoidance of doubt, a
                        court may neither refuse to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, nor refuse to stay arbitration
                        proceedings, pursuant to state law that is inconsistent with the FAA or Delaware law (including,
                        for example, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.2(c).) This Arbitration
                        Agreement survives after the Agreement terminates or your relationship with Lyft ends. ANY
                        ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND
                        CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. Except as expressly provided below, this Arbitration Agreement
                        applies to all Claims (defined below) between you and Lyft (as defined above) as well as between
                        you and our successors and assigns, employees, agents or shareholders. This Arbitration
                        Agreement also applies to claims between you and Lyft’s service providers, including but not
                        limited to background check providers and payment processors; and such service providers shall
                        be considered intended third-party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.
Except as expressly provided below, ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US (EACH A “CLAIM” AND
                        COLLECTIVELY, “CLAIMS”) SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. These Claims
                        include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past,
                        present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions
                        thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof),
                        the Lyft Platform, the Rideshare Services, the Lyft Services, Lyft promotions, gift card,
                        referrals or loyalty programs, the Lyft Tablet, any other goods or services made available
                        through the Lyft Platform by Lyft or a third-party provider, your relationship with Lyft, the
                        threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User account or this
                        Agreement, criminal background checks and driving history checks performed by or on Lyft’s
                        behalf, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any promotions or
                        offers made by Lyft, any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law, trade secrets, unfair
                        competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination,
                        discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, emotional distress, breach of any
                        express or implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer
                        protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone
                        Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Uniform
                        Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination
                        in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor
                        Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (except for individual claims for
                        employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Lyft and covered by the Employee
                        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any,
                        addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and
                        common law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes
                        about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration
                        Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND LYFT ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
                        COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS
                        ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every
                        claim or dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by
                        the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from the requirement to
                        arbitrate.
(b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND LYFT MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE
                        OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE
                        BASIS (“CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND LYFT BOTH ARE WAIVING THE
                        RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
                        CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SUBSECTION
                        (B) SHALL NOT APPLY TO REPRESENTATIVE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST LYFT,
                        WHICH ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY IN SECTION 17(C). ALSO NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES
                        MAY AGREE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-WIDE SETTLEMENT.
The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on
                        any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or
                        resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. The
                        arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
                        seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's
                        individual claims.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the American
                        Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or
                        enforceability of this subsection (b) may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator.
                        In any case in which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action
                        or otherwise seeks relief that is not limited to the individual party seeking relief, and (2)
                        there is a final judicial determination that this subsection (b) is unenforceable with respect
                        to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim (such as a request for public injunctive
                        relief), then that Claim or particular remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall
                        be severed from any remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a court of competent
                        jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver and all other provisions in this subsection (b) shall
                        be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims or remedies to the
                        fullest extent possible. The Parties agree that a court will decide any Claim or any particular
                        remedy for a Claim severed from any arbitration only after the completion of that arbitration.
(c) Representative PAGA Waiver.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, to the
                        fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Lyft agree not to bring a representative action on
                        behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code
                        § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                        attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Lyft agree that any
                        such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve
                        whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such
                        an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or
                        collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject
                        to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA
                        Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of
                        this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction
                        and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                        unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from
                        this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on
                        the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims or portions of Claims be
                        arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such
                        representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims or portions of
                        such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
                        To the extent that there are any Claims or portions of Claims to be litigated in a civil court
                        of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
                        representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims or portions of Claims,
                        the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims or portions of Claims shall be stayed pending
                        the outcome of any individual Claims or portions of Claims in arbitration.
(d) Pre-Arbitration Process.
A party who intends to initiate arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of the
                        dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must (1) describe the factual and legal nature and basis of the
                        claim or dispute; (2) set forth the specific relief sought; and (3) include the name, mailing
                        and email addresses, and phone number of the party sending the Notice.
Your Notice to Lyft must be personally signed by you (and by your attorney if you are
                        represented by counsel). Lyft’s notice to you must be personally signed by a Lyft representative
                        (and Lyft’s attorney if Lyft is represented by counsel). To safeguard your User Account, you
                        might be required to provide both your authentication and consent for us to discuss your User
                        Account or share your User Account information with anyone but you, including an attorney
                        (“Authentication and Consent”).
Your Notice to Lyft should be sent by email to disputenotice@lyft.com. Lyft’s notice to you will
                        be sent by email to the most recent contact information that you have provided to Lyft.
Whoever sends the Notice must give the other party 60 days from receipt of the complete Notice
                        (including the Authentication and Consent, if required) to investigate the claim before
                        commencing an arbitration. The submission of a complete Notice will toll any applicable statute
                        of limitations or other limitations period for the claims and requested relief in the Notice
                        until 60 days from when the other party receives the Notice of Dispute.
This Pre-Arbitration Process is essential so that you and Lyft have a meaningful chance to
                        resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court can
                        enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration or assessment or collection of any
                        arbitration fees in connection with such an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law,
                        the American Arbitration Association (or any other arbitration provider selected by the parties)
                        may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with such an arbitration. If
                        the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed. If a process arbitrator has been
                        appointed at the request of a party, the process arbitrator also has the same authority as a
                        court to enforce the requirement that arbitration not be commenced until the requirements of
                        this Section 17(d) have been satisfied.
(e) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the
                        AAA pursuant to its
Consumer Arbitration Rules
, and, if applicable, its Mass
                        Arbitration Supplementary Rules, that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated
                        (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of the AAA rules
                        can be obtained at the AAA’s website (
www.adr.org
).
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and
                        circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                        different set of AAA Rules, but in no event, unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, shall the
                        arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of
                        representative, collective, or class proceeding. The parties may select a different arbitration
                        administrator, forum, and/or third party neutral upon mutual written agreement. If the AAA is
                        unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, you and Lyft
                        will select another arbitration provider, forum, and/or third party neutral upon mutual written
                        agreement. If there is no agreement, a court will do so.
As part of the arbitration, both you and Lyft will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery
                        of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. Except as specified in subsections
                        (b) and (c) above, the arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available
                        in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
                        individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
                        that party's individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the
                        arbitrator’s decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on
                        which the decision is based.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and
                        will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
                        rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in
                        prior arbitrations involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                        The arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different Riders or
                        Drivers. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by
                        the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award
                        may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(f) Arbitration Fees and Awards.
The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA Rules subject to
                        the following modifications:
If Lyft initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Lyft will pay all AAA filing
                            and arbitration fees.
With respect to any Claims brought by Lyft against a Driver, or for Claims brought by a
                            Driver against Lyft that: (A) are based on an alleged employment relationship between Lyft
                            and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s actual deactivation of a Driver’s User
                            account or a threat by Lyft to deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or
                            relate to, Lyft’s actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with Lyft under the termination
                            provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Lyft to terminate a Driver’s Agreement; (D)
                            arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including Lyft’s commission
                            or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly guarantees owed by Lyft to Drivers for
                            Rideshare Services, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other Lyft promotions,
                            or consumer-type disputes, or (E) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in
                            connection with a user seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections
                            (A)-(E) shall be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”), Lyft shall pay all costs
                            unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a
                            court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the extent not
                            paid by Lyft pursuant to the fee provisions above). However, if you are the party initiating
                            the Driver Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the
                            filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in
                            the state in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would
                            be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (f)(1) above. Any
                            dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator.
                            For purposes of this Section 17(f)(2), the term “Driver” shall be deemed to include both
                            Drivers and Driver applicants who have not been approved to drive.
Unless applicable law provides otherwise, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and
                            pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would
                            incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or
                            documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
                            Notwithstanding the foregoing, an arbitrator may award costs as provided in Federal Rule of
                            Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents (which the parties agree shall apply in
                            arbitration).
At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any
                            portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.
Although under some laws Lyft may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and non-filing
                            fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Lyft agrees that it will not seek such an
                            award from you unless you are represented by an attorney or the arbitrator has determined
                            that you or your counsel have violated the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
                            11(b), which the parties agree shall be applicable in arbitration.
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Lyft’s last written
                            settlement offer made after you fully complied with the Pre-Arbitration Process described in
                            subsection (d) above, then Lyft will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000,
                            whichever is greater. In determining whether you are entitled to the minimum $1,000 payment,
                            the arbitrator shall not consider amounts offered or awarded for attorneys’ fees or costs.
(g) Location and Manner of Arbitration.
Unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, the arbitration hearing, if any, between Lyft and a Rider
                        will take place in the county of your billing address or by videoconference, and the arbitration
                        hearing, if any, between Lyft and a Driver will take place in the county in which the Driver
                        provides Rideshare Services or by videoconference. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your
                        county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for an AAA
                        arbitration. Your right to the hearing and the format of the hearing will be determined by the
                        AAA Rules. You and Lyft agree that you and a Lyft representative will personally appear (which
                        can include appearance by videoconference) at the hearing (along with your and Lyft’s respective
                        legal counsel, if the parties are represented by counsel).
(h) Additional Procedures for Coordinated Claims.
If 25 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and
                        are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are
                        submitted simultaneously), the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by this
                        Arbitration Agreement, shall apply, and all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in
                        stages using bellwether proceedings if they are not resolved during the Pre-Arbitration Process.
                        You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first
                        stage, each side shall select up to 20 cases (40 cases total) to be filed in arbitration. The
                        cases shall be resolved individually by different arbitrators to the extent that the AAA has a
                        sufficient number of arbitrators available. If the AAA does not have a sufficient number of
                        available arbitrators to decide all of the cases filed, the AAA may assign multiple cases to the
                        same arbitrator, but the arbitrator must still resolve each case individually. In the meantime,
                        no other cases may be filed in arbitration, and the AAA shall not accept, administer, or demand
                        payment of fees for arbitrations commenced in violation of this subsection 17(h).
After the first stage is completed, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all
                        remaining cases, and Lyft will pay the mediation fee. The parties shall attempt to reach
                        agreement on a mutually agreeable mediator. If the parties cannot reach an agreement, AAA will
                        oversee a rank and strike process with the parties and, if no agreeable mediator is chosen, AAA
                        may administratively appoint a mediator. If the parties cannot agree how to resolve the
                        remaining cases after the conclusion of the first stage of bellwether proceedings, the process
                        will be repeated until all claims are resolved, except that in the second and later stages each
                        side shall select up to 50 cases (100 cases total) to be filed in arbitration. Between stages,
                        counsel for the parties shall meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the
                        staged proceedings, including whether to further increase the number of cases filed in each
                        stage.
If this subsection 17(h) applies to a Notice, the statute of limitations applicable to the
                        claims and relief set forth in that Notice shall be tolled from the date the Notice is sent
                        until that Notice is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A
                        court will have authority to enforce this subsection 17(h), including to enjoin the filing,
                        assessing or demanding fees for, administration of, or prosecution of arbitrations. To the
                        fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the parties consent to the jurisdiction and venue of
                        the courts in San Francisco County, California, to enforce this subsection 17(h).
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, if either
                        party requests appointment of a process arbitrator, a process arbitrator may decide issues
                        relating to compliance with the requirements of subsection 17(d) above or this subsection 17(h),
                        or the issues that a process arbitrator may decide under Rule MA-6 of the AAA’s Mass Arbitration
                        Supplementary Rules.
This subsection 17(h) and each of its requirements are intended to be severable from the rest of
                        this Arbitration Agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court decides that the
                        staging process in this subsection 17(h) is not enforceable, then the cases may be filed in
                        arbitration.
(i) Exceptions to Arbitration.
This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1)
                        small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small
                        claims court’s jurisdiction, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of
                        general jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or
                        other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section
                        17(c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under
                        applicable law not preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability
                        insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration
                        as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and (5) individual claims of
                        sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection with the use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft
                        Services, or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are brought in a court of competent
                        jurisdiction consistent with Section 18, Lyft will not require arbitration of those claims.
                        Lyft’s agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not waive the enforceability of
                        any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement (including without limitation the waivers
                        provided in Section 17(b)), or of the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any
                        other dispute, claim, or controversy.
Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or
                        charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities
                        Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”), or Office of Federal Contract
                        Compliance Programs, or similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration
                        Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim
                        before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies
                        before making a claim in arbitration However, should you bring an administrative claim, you may
                        only seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement, and you
                        knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant
                        to any administrative complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB. Should you
                        participate in an NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not
                        arise from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Agreement or
                        settled by you. Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this Arbitration Agreement if
                        you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration
                        Agreement prevents your participation in an investigation by a government agency of any report,
                        claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement.
(j) Severability.
Except as otherwise provided in the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c) above, in
                        the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable
                        under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder
                        of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.
(k) Driver Claims in Pending Settlement.
If you are a member of a putative class in a lawsuit against Lyft involving Driver Claims and a
                        Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Settlement has been filed with the court in that lawsuit
                        prior to this Agreement’s effective date (a “Pending Settlement Action”), then this Arbitration
                        Agreement shall not apply to your Driver Claims in that particular class action. Instead, your
                        Driver Claims in that Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration
                        provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you accepted prior to this Agreement’s
                        effective date.
(l) Opting Out of Arbitration for Driver Claims That Are Not in a Pending Settlement Action.
As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate Driver Claims
                        defined in Section 17(f)(2) (except as limited by Section 17(k) above) pursuant to the terms of
                        this subsection if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in Lyft’s Terms of
                        Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have
                        previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your
                        prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified below, but opting out
                        of this arbitration provision has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration
                        agreements that you may have with Lyft. If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration
                        provision and do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver
                        Claims, you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such Driver Claims, other than those in a
                        Pending Settlement Action, by notifying Lyft in writing of your desire to opt out of arbitration
                        for such Driver Claims, which writing must be dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to
                        arbitrationoptout@lyft.com.
In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of this
                        Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending Settlement
                        Action, (B) the writing must include the name, phone number, and email address associated with
                        your User Account, and (C) the email containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days
                        after the date this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the 30-day
                        period, you and Lyft shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement in full
                        (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending Settlement Action). As
                        provided in paragraph 17(k) above, any opt out that you submit shall not apply to any Driver
                        Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action and your Driver Claims in any such Pending
                        Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions that are contained
                        in the applicable Lyft Terms of Use that you agreed to prior to the effective date of this
                        Agreement.
Cases have been filed against Lyft and may be filed in the future involving Driver Claims. You
                        should assume that there are now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against Lyft alleging
                        class, collective, and/or representative Driver Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on
                        your behalf, and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you
                        do agree to arbitration of Driver Claims with Lyft under this Arbitration Agreement, you are
                        agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief,
                        against Lyft in an individual arbitration, except for the Driver Claims that are part of a
                        Pending Settlement Action. You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or
                        seek to recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class,
                        collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your
                        choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not be subject to retaliation if you
                        exercise your right to assert claims or opt out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration
                        Agreement.
(m) Binding Effect; Third-Party Beneficiaries.
This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by or
                        against any third parties, including but not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party
                        beneficiaries and permitted assigns, where their underlying claim(s) arise out of or relate to
                        your use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, or Rideshare Services. To the extent that any
                        third-party beneficiary to this Agreement brings claims against a party, those claims shall also
                        be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
Choice of Forum and Class-Action and Coordinated-Action Waiver for Non-Arbitrated Claims
Claims (1) excepted from arbitration by, and brought consistent with, Section 17(i) or (2)
                        otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be subject to arbitration,
                        shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts in the state in which the incident
                        or accident underlying the plaintiff's claim(s) occurred, notwithstanding that other courts may
                        have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims or personal jurisdiction over the parties.
If for any reason claims do not proceed in arbitration, such claims may be brought and litigated
                        on an individual basis only. On an individual basis means that you cannot bring such claims as a
                        class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass, multi-plaintiff, joint, and/or
                        representative action against Lyft, or otherwise seek to include your claims or case in a
                        pending class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass, multi-plaintiff, joint, and/or
                        representative action against Lyft. No action brought by you may be consolidated or joined in
                        any fashion with any other proceeding, except that the parties may agree to participate in a
                        class-wide settlement. The interpretation, enforceability, and validity of this paragraph shall
                        be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to choice of law principles, and
                        by any applicable federal law. If Delaware law is inapplicable for any reason, then the
                        interpretation, enforceability, and validity of this paragraph shall be governed by the law of
                        the state where the court of competent jurisdiction deciding the claims is located. If there is
                        a final judicial determination that any part of this paragraph is unenforceable or unlawful for
                        any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful portion shall be severed and severance shall have no
                        effect whatsoever on the enforceability, applicability, or validity of any other part of this
                        Agreement, including without limitation the choice-of-forum provision in the preceding
                        paragraph.
Confidentiality
You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and confidential
                        information relating to Lyft’s business, operations and properties, information about a User
                        made available to you in connection with such User’s use of the Lyft Platform, which may include
                        the User’s name, pick-up location, contact information and photo (“Confidential Information”)
                        disclosed to you by Lyft for your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein.
                        You shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties,
                        and you agree not to store separate and outside of the Lyft Platform any Confidential
                        Information obtained from the Lyft Platform. As a Driver, you understand that some of the
                        Confidential Information you receive may be protected by federal and/or state confidentiality
                        laws, such as the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”),
                        governing the privacy and security of protected (patient) health information. You understand
                        that any violation of the Agreement’s confidentiality provisions may violate HIPAA or other
                        federal and/or state confidentiality laws and could result in civil or criminal penalties
                        against you. You will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid
                        disclosure or use of Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the
                        public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have liability to Lyft with regard to
                        any Confidential Information which you can prove: was in the public domain at the time it was
                        disclosed by Lyft or has entered the public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you,
                        without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the
                        time of disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of Lyft; becomes known to you,
                        without restriction, from a source other than Lyft without breach of this Agreement by you and
                        otherwise not in violation of Lyft’s rights; or is disclosed pursuant to the order or
                        requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however,
                        that you shall provide prompt notice of such court order or requirement to Lyft to enable Lyft
                        to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.
Relationship with Lyft
As a Driver on the Lyft Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you and Lyft are in a direct
                        business relationship, and the relationship between the parties under this Agreement is solely
                        that of independent contracting parties. You and Lyft expressly agree that (1) this is not an
                        employment agreement and does not create an employment relationship between you and Lyft; and
                        (2) no joint venture, franchisor-franchisee, partnership, or agency relationship is intended or
                        created by this Agreement. You have no authority to bind Lyft, and you will not hold yourself
                        out as an employee, agent or authorized representative of Lyft.
Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your
                        performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with your provision of
                        Rideshare Services, your acts or omissions, or your operation and maintenance of your vehicle.
                        You retain the sole right to determine when, where, and for how long you will use the Lyft
                        Platform. Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, unilaterally prescribe specific dates,
                        times of day, or any minimum number of hours for you to use the Lyft Platform. You retain the
                        option to accept or to decline or ignore a Rider’s request for Rideshare Services via the Lyft
                        Platform, or to cancel an accepted request for Rideshare Services via the Lyft Platform, subject
                        to Lyft’s then-current cancellation policies. Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, require
                        you to accept any specific request for Rideshare Services as a condition of maintaining access
                        to the platform. With the exception of any signage required by law or permit/license rules or
                        requirements, Lyft shall have no right to require you to: (a) display Lyft’s names, logos or
                        colors on your vehicle(s); or (b) wear a uniform or any other clothing displaying Lyft’s names,
                        logos or colors. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion to provide
                        Rideshare Services or otherwise engage in any other business or employment activities, including
                        but not limited to providing services similar to the Rideshare Services to other companies, and
                        that Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, restrict you from engaging in any such activity.
Third-Party Services
In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the Lyft Platform may enable Users to provide
                        services or receive services from other third parties. For example, Users may be able to use the
                        Lyft Platform to plan and reserve rides on public transportation, take a ride in an Autonomous
                        Vehicle provided by a third party, rent vehicles, bikes, scooters, or other similar personal
                        transportation devices provided by a third party, receive roadside assistance, or obtain
                        financial, vehicle repair, insurance, or other services provided by third parties (collectively,
                        the “Third-Party Services”). This Agreement between you and Lyft governs your use of the Lyft
                        Platform in connection with the Third-Party Services.
In addition, you understand that the Third-Party Services may also be subject to terms and
                        pricing of the third-party provider (collectively, the “Third-Party Terms”) which will govern
                        your relationship with such third-party provider, as applicable. You agree that Lyft is not
                        responsible and may not be held liable for the Third-Party Services or the actions or omissions
                        of the third-party provider. Such Third-Party Services may not be investigated, monitored or
                        checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by Lyft, and Lyft is not responsible for
                        any Third-Party Services accessed through the Lyft Platform. This Agreement incorporates by
                        reference
ADT Mobile Security Monitoring Terms
, which are Third-Party Terms.
In the event of a conflict in the terms of any Third-Party Terms and this Agreement, the terms
                        of this Agreement shall control with respect to Lyft and your agreements with Lyft herein, and
                        the limitations of liability set forth in Section 15 above shall also apply to the third-party
                        provider. The Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement provisions in Section 17 above shall
                        apply instead of any terms in any Third-Party Terms for all purposes except with respect to
                        claims that are solely against the third-party provider.
General
Except as provided in Sections 17 and 18, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
                        State of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of law provision is
                        only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret this Agreement and is not
                        intended to create any other substantive right to non-Californians to assert claims under
                        California law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. If any provision of this Agreement
                        is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of
                        this Agreement. In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision
                        with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a
                        similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this
                        Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and all incorporated agreements may be automatically
                        assigned by Lyft, in our sole discretion by providing notice to you. You may not assign this
                        Agreement without Lyft’s prior written approval. Any purported assignment by you in violation of
                        this Section 22 shall be void. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Lyft shall
                        be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to Lyft, Inc., 548
                        Market Street, #68514 San Francisco, CA 94104. Any notices to you shall be provided to you
                        through the Lyft Platform or given to you via the email address or physical address you provide
                        to Lyft during the registration process. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way
                        define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. The words “include”,
                        “includes” and “including” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” A
                        party’s failure to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver
                        of the party’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches, any such waiver
                        shall be in writing. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between
                        you and Lyft with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous
                        understandings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written.

.The Lyft Platform
The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where, among other things, persons who seek
                        transportation to certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to
                        such destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are
                        driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers, Riders, and any other
                        individuals, excluding any Excluded Individuals, using the Lyft Platform are collectively
                        referred to herein as “Users.” The driving services provided (a) by Drivers to Riders (including
                        other transportation related services provided by Drivers), or (b) by means of autonomous
                        vehicles (“Autonomous Vehicles” or “AVs”), in connection with the Lyft Platform, shall
                        collectively be referred to herein as “Rideshare Services” and the providers thereof “Rideshare
                        Providers.” “Lyft Services” shall include any service provided by Lyft pursuant to the Lyft
                        Platform (for clarity, Lyft Services does not include Rideshare Services or Third-Party
                        Services). As a User, you authorize Lyft to match and/or re-match you with Drivers or Riders or
                        AVs based on factors such as your location, the requested pickup location, the estimated time to
                        pickup, your destination, User preferences, ride mode, driver mode, applicable vehicle
                        requirements, membership status, regulatory or other third-party requirements, user statistics,
                        and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match based on the same or other
                        considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a decision made
                        in such User’s sole discretion. A separate agreement is formed between Drivers and Riders when
                        the Rider accepts the offered Rideshare Services. As used herein, “Excluded Individuals” means
                        any individual who is registering to use the Lyft Platform or whose use of the Lyft Platform is
                        on behalf of an organization contracted with Lyft, except as a Rider or Driver.
In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent transportation modalities (e.g., bikes,
                        scooters, cars, etc.) or be offered other services through the Lyft Platform. In some markets,
                        some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned and operated by Lyft. In other
                        markets, some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned or operated by third
                        parties.
In any case, your use of Lyft Services through the Lyft Platform may be subject to additional
                        agreements between you and Lyft as applicable to the particular service in the particular market
                        (“Supplemental Agreements”). Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT,
                            YOU MAY NOT RENT OR USE LYFT SERVICES IN SUCH MARKET.
In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any
                        Supplemental Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control, unless such Supplemental
                        Agreement specifically states otherwise.
Modification to the Agreement
Lyft reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including by
                        changing or deleting existing terms or by adding new ones, and such modifications shall be
                        binding on you upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Continued use of the Lyft
                        Platform after modifications to this Agreement shall constitute your acceptance of such
                        modifications. Drivers or driver applicants, however, may opt out of revisions to the
                        Agreement’s arbitration provisions with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17
                        below. Lyft reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks
                        from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon
                        posting. Continued use of the Lyft Platform after modifications to any information on pages
                        referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement shall constitute your acceptance of such
                        modifications.
Eligibility
The Lyft Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and authority to enter into
                        this Agreement and are fully able and competent to satisfy the terms, conditions, and
                        obligations herein. The Lyft Platform is not available to Users who have had their User account
                        temporarily or permanently deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User
                        account, you agree that you are the sole authorized user of your User account, and you may not
                        use your User account on behalf of any third party, except as otherwise expressly permitted by
                        Lyft. To use the Lyft Platform, each User shall create a User account. Each person may only
                        create one User account, and Lyft reserves the right to deactivate any additional or duplicate
                        accounts. Your participation in certain Lyft programs and use of certain Lyft services may be
                        subject to additional eligibility requirements as determined by Lyft.
By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are the parent or legal guardian of a 16 or 17-year old
                        minor you may create a User account for such minor to use the Lyft Platform subject to the
                        following requirements and restrictions: (a) you ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft
                        Platform is limited solely to accessing and using Lyft Services and/or Third-Party Services
                        where expressly permitted under the Supplemental Agreement applicable to such Lyft Services
                        and/or Third-Party Services, (b) you determine that the Lyft Services and/or Third-Party
                        Services are suitable for the minor, (c) you ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform
                        and applicable Lyft Services and/or Third-Party Services is done in compliance and
                        acknowledgement of all applicable safety instructions and warnings in this Agreement, any
                        applicable Supplemental Agreements, and the Lyft Platform, (d) you ensure that the minor does
                        not request or accept any Rideshare Services unless accompanied by you or an authorized
                        guardian, and (e) you explain the terms of this Agreement to the minor. For clarity, no
                        unaccompanied User under 18 years old may ride in an Autonomous Vehicle.
By creating a User account for such minor, you hereby give permission and consent to the
                        Agreement on the minor’s behalf, you expressly guarantee the minor’s acceptance, and your own
                        acceptance, of the terms of this Agreement, and you shall assume any and all responsibility and
                        liability for the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform as provided by the terms of this Agreement
                        and any applicable Supplemental Agreements. You will be responsible for any breach of the above
                        representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any attempt of the minor to disaffirm
                        this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent that you are fully authorized to execute this
                        Agreement on behalf of yourself and all other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.
Charges
As a User, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services, Lyft Services, or
                        Third-Party Services may result in charges (“Charges”) to you and/or to an organization, if
                        applicable. Charges to Riders and/or organizations, if applicable, for Rideshare Services
                        include Fares (defined below) and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes, including
                        as set forth on your market’s
Lyft Cities page
(“Lyft
                        Cities Page”), plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and
                        reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your
                        market’s Lyft Cities Page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a
                        request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., economy, extra seats,
                        luxury) as described on your market’s Lyft Cities Page or within the Lyft Platform. You are
                        responsible for reviewing the applicable Lyft Cities Page or price quote within the Lyft
                        Platform and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account regardless of
                        your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
Rideshare Service Fares (“Fares”). There are two types of Fares, quoted and variable.
Quoted Fares
. When you make a ride request using the Lyft Platform, Lyft
                            will quote you a Fare at the time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the
                            ride request is confirmed. If your final destination is not the same as the destination in
                            your ride request, or the time and/or distance of your ride differs substantially from your
                            quoted fare, or if you attempt to abuse the Lyft Platform, we may, at Lyft’s sole discretion
                            and determination, cancel the fare quote and charge you a variable fare as described below.
                            Lyft does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare for the
                            same ride. Quoted fares may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as
                            applicable.
Variable Fares
. Variable fares consist of a base charge and incremental
                            charges based on the time and distance of your ride. For particularly short rides, minimum
                            fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS data from your Rideshare Provider’s device to
                            calculate the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee the availability or
                            accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal, we will calculate time and distance using available
                            data from your ride. In addition to the variable fare, the total cost of your ride may
                            include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as applicable.
Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges.
Service Fee
. Lyft may charge a “Service Fee” for each ride, as set forth on
                            the applicable Lyft Cities Page.
Prime Time
. At certain times, including times of high demand for Rideshare
                            Services (“Prime Time”), you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For quoted
                            fares, we may factor Prime Time increases into the quoted price of the ride.
Priority Pickup and Wait & Save
. In some cases, you may be able to select
                            an expected pick up that is faster or slower than standard for a higher or lower Fare,
                            respectively.
Cancellation Fee
. After requesting a ride you may cancel it through the
                            Lyft Platform, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply. Lyft may also
                            charge a fee if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please check out our Help
                            Center to learn more about
Lyft’s rider cancellation policy
.
Damage Fee
. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the
                            Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250 depending on the extent of
                            the damage (as determined by Lyft in its sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or
                            cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require
                            documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee.
Abuse Fee
. If we receive a credible report that you have misused or abused
                            the Lyft Platform, you agree to pay an “Abuse Fee” of up to $250 as determined by Lyft in
                            its sole discretion. Lyft reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise
                            require documentation of abuse prior to processing the Abuse Fee.
Tolls
. In some instances tolls, toll estimates, and/or return tolls may
                            apply to your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market’s Lyft Cities Page for more
                            information about toll charges. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Lyft will
                            match the toll charged to the Rideshare Provider, if any.
Other Charges
. Other fees and surcharges may apply to your ride, including
                            but not limited to: actual or anticipated airport fees, state fees, local fees, event fees,
                            fuel surcharges, wait time fees, or distance surcharges as determined by Lyft or its
                            marketing partners. In addition, where required by law Lyft will collect applicable taxes.
                            See your market’s Lyft Cities Page for information on other Charges that may apply to your
                            ride.
Tips
. Following a ride, you may have the opportunity to elect to tip your
                            Driver in cash or through the Lyft Platform. You may also elect to set a default tip amount
                            or percentage through the Lyft Platform. Any tips will be provided entirely to the
                            applicable Driver.
Charges Generally.
Facilitation of Charges
. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party
                            payment processor (First Data, Stripe, Inc., Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc., etc.).
                            Lyft may replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you. With the exception
                            of tips and the purchase of Lyft Cash, cash payments are strictly prohibited unless
                            expressly permitted by Lyft. Your payment of Charges to Lyft satisfies your payment
                            obligation for your use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, and
                            Rideshare Services. Certain Charges may be collectively billed as a single purchase
                            transaction to your selected payment method based on the payment frequency indicated in your
                            settings. If your primary payment method expires, is invalid, or if Charges to your primary
                            payment method are unable to be processed for whatever reason, then you agree that Lyft may
                            charge your other available payment methods in the Lyft Platform. If you don't recognize a
                            transaction, then check your ride receipts and payment history.
No Refunds
. All Charges are non-refundable except to the extent required by
                            law. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate
                            usage of the Lyft Platform, any disruption to the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party
                            Services, or Rideshare Services, or any other reason whatsoever.
Coupons
. You may receive coupons, credits, discounts, or other promotions
                            (collectively, “Coupons”) that you can apply toward payment of certain Charges. Coupons are
                            valid only for use on the Lyft Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash
                            except as required by law. Coupons cannot be combined unless expressly provided otherwise,
                            and if the cost of your Charges exceeds the applicable Coupon value, we may charge your
                            payment method on file for the Charges in excess of the Coupon amount. With respect to
                            Fares, Lyft may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee, Tolls, or Other Charges
                            before application of the Coupon. Additional restrictions on Coupons may apply as
                            communicated to you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant Coupon within the
                            Rewards section of the Lyft Platform.
Supplemental Charges
. Charges related to Lyft Services (including the
                            rental of bikes and scooters) may be further detailed in the applicable Supplemental
                            Agreement.
Third-Party Charges
. If you choose to purchase Third-Party Services
                            (described further in Section 21) through the Lyft Platform, you authorize your payment
                            method on file to be charged according to the pricing terms set by Lyft or the third-party
                            provider, or as otherwise provided in the terms of the purchased services.
Payment Card Authorization
. Upon addition of a new payment method or each
                            request for Lyft Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services, Lyft may seek
                            authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the
                            Charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not
                            a charge; however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until
                            your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total
                            funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank
                            issuing your debit or prepaid card. Lyft is not responsible for these charges and is unable
                            to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to learn
                            more about

                            Services; such vehicle is in good operating condition and meets the industry safety
                            standards and all applicable statutory and state and local requirements for a vehicle of its
                            kind; such vehicle meets the applicable requirements of the Lyft Platform; and any and all

You will only provide Rideshare Services using the vehicle that has been reported to, and
                            approved by Lyft, and you will not transport more passengers than can securely be seated in
                            such vehicle (and no more than seven (7) passengers in any instance).

                            or taxi service, accept street hails, charge for rides (except as expressly provided in this

                            records, and you agree to provide any further necessary authorizations to facilitate our
                            access to such records during the term of the Agreement.

                            you use to provide Rideshare Services, and you agree to provide proof of such insurance and
                            that information regarding such insurance may be released to Lyft upon Lyft’s reasonable
                            request.
You understand that providing Rideshare Services to unaccompanied persons under the age of
                            18 is prohibited, and you will cancel any ride involving an unaccompanied person under the
                            age of 18.
If you are a professionally licensed or permitted Driver providing Rideshare Services on the
                            Lyft Platform, you have or are subject to a valid commercial automobile insurance policy
                            that meets all applicable requirements.
You will pay all applicable federal, state and local taxes based on your provision of
                            Rideshare Services and any payments received by you.
You will comply with Lyft’s reasonable requests to provide information in connection with
                            Rider complaints, law enforcement requests, or any other incident.

                        of their respective owners. You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions,
                        ideas, feedback or other information (“Submissions”) provided by you or on your behalf to us are
                        non-confidential and shall become the sole property of Lyft. Lyft shall own exclusive rights,
                        including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and
                        dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without

LYFT and other Lyft logos, designs, graphics, icons, scripts and service names are registered
                        trademarks, trademarks or trade dress of Lyft in the United States and/or other countries
                        (collectively, the “Lyft Marks”). If you provide Rideshare Services as a Driver, Lyft grants to
                        you, during the term of this Agreement, and subject to your compliance with the terms and
                        conditions of this Agreement, a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to display and use the
                        Lyft Marks solely on the Lyft stickers/decals, and any other Lyft-branded items provided by Lyft
                        directly to you in connection with providing the Rideshare Services (“License”). The License is
                        non-transferable and non-assignable, and you shall not grant to any third party any right,
                        permission, license or sublicense with respect to any of the rights granted hereunder without
                        Lyft’s prior written permission, which it may withhold in its sole discretion. The Lyft logo (or
                        any Lyft Marks) may not be used in any manner that is likely to cause confusion, including but
                        not limited to: use of a Lyft Mark in a domain name or Lyft referral code, or use of a Lyft Mark
                        as a social media handle or name, avatar, profile photo, icon, favicon, or banner. You may
                        identify yourself as a Driver on the Lyft Platform, but may not misidentify yourself as Lyft, an
                        employee of Lyft, or a representative or agent of Lyft.
You acknowledge that Lyft is the owner and licensor of the Lyft Marks, including all goodwill
                        associated therewith, and that your use of the Lyft logo (or any Lyft Marks) will confer no
                        interest in or ownership of the Lyft Marks in you but rather inures to the benefit of Lyft. You
                        agree to use the Lyft logo strictly in accordance with Lyft’s Brand Guidelines, as may be
                        provided to you and revised from time to time, and to immediately cease any use that Lyft
                        determines to be nonconforming or otherwise unacceptable.
You agree that you will not: (1) create any materials that use the Lyft Marks or any derivatives
                        of the Lyft Marks as a trademark, service mark, trade name or trade dress, other than as
                        expressly approved by Lyft in writing; (2) use the Lyft Marks in any way that tends to impair
                        their validity as proprietary trademarks, service marks, trade names or trade dress, or use the
                        Lyft Marks other than in accordance with the terms, conditions and restrictions herein; (3) take
                        any other action that would jeopardize or impair Lyft’s rights as owner of the Lyft Marks or the
                        legality and/or enforceability of the Lyft Marks, including challenging or opposing Lyft’s
                        ownership in the Lyft Marks; (4) apply for trademark registration or renewal of trademark
                        registration of any of the Lyft Marks, any derivative of the Lyft Marks, any combination of the
                        Lyft Marks and any other name, or any trademark, service mark, trade name, symbol or word which
                        is similar to the Lyft Marks; (5) use the Lyft Marks on or in connection with any product,
                        service or activity that is in violation of any law, statute, government regulation or standard.
You agree you will not rent, lease, lend, sell, or otherwise redistribute the Lyft driver Amp or
                        Glow, or manufacture, produce, print, sell, distribute, purchase, or display
                        counterfeit/inauthentic Lyft driver Amps, Glows, or other Lyft Marks or (including but not
                        limited to signage, stickers, apparel, or decals) from any source other than directly from Lyft.
Violation of any provision of this License may result in immediate termination of the License,
                        in Lyft’s sole discretion, a takedown request sent to the appropriate ISP, or social media
                        platform, and/or a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy Proceeding (or equivalent
                        proceeding). If you create any materials (physical or digital) bearing the Lyft Marks (in
                        violation of this Agreement or otherwise), you agree that upon their creation Lyft exclusively
                        owns all right, title and interest in and to such materials, including any modifications to the
                        Lyft Marks or derivative works based on the Lyft Marks or Lyft copyrights. You hereby assign any
                        interest or right you may have in such materials to Lyft, and shall provide information and
                        execute any documents as reasonably requested by Lyft to enable Lyft to formalize such
                        assignment.
Lyft respects the intellectual property of others, and expects Users to do the same. If you
                        believe, in good faith, that any materials on the Lyft Platform infringe upon your copyrights,
                        please

Disclaimers
The following disclaimers are made on behalf of Lyft, our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents,
                        successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and
                        shareholders.
Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation carrier. Lyft is
                        not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Rideshare Provider to decide whether or
                        not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through the Lyft Platform, and it is up to the Rider to
                        decide whether or not to accept a ride from any Rideshare Provider contacted through the Lyft
                        Platform. We cannot ensure that a Rideshare Provider or Rider will complete an arranged
                        transportation service. We have no control over the quality or safety of the transportation that
                        occurs as a result of the Rideshare Services. Any safety-related feature, process, policy,
                        standard, or other effort undertaken by Lyft is not an indication of any employment or agency
                        relationship with any User.
The Lyft Platform is provided on an “as is” basis and without any warranty or condition,
                        express, implied or statutory. We do not guarantee and do not promise any specific results from
                        use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, and/or the Rideshare Services,
                        including the ability to provide or receive Rideshare Services at any given location or time.
                        Lyft reserves the right, for example, to limit or eliminate access to the Lyft Platform for
                        Rideshare Services, Third-Party Services, and/or Lyft Services in specific geographic areas
                        and/or at specific times based on commercial viability, public health concerns, or changes in
                        law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties of
                        title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Some states do
                        not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to
                        you.
We do not warrant that your use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, or
                        Rideshare Services will be accurate, complete, reliable, current, secure, uninterrupted, always
                        available, or error-free, or will meet your requirements, that any defects in the Lyft Platform
                        will be corrected, or that the Lyft Platform is free of viruses or other harmful components. We
                        disclaim liability for, and no warranty is made with respect to, connectivity, availability,
                        accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party
                        Services, or Rideshare Services, including with respect to mapping, navigation, estimated times
                        of arrival, and routing services. You are responsible at all times for your conduct and the
                        consequences of your conduct while using the Lyft Platform.
We cannot guarantee that each Rider or Driver is who he or she claims to be. Please use common
                        sense when using the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, and Rideshare Services,
                        including looking at the photos of the Driver or Rider you have matched with to make sure it is
                        the same individual you see in person. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with
                        underage persons or people acting under false pretense, and we do not accept responsibility or
                        liability for any content, communication or other use or access of the Lyft Platform by persons
                        under the age of 18 in violation of this Agreement. We encourage you to communicate directly
                        with each potential Driver or Rider prior to engaging in an arranged transportation service.
Lyft is not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any User of the Lyft
                        Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services. You are solely responsible
                        for your interactions with other Users. We do not procure insurance for, nor are we responsible
                        for, personal belongings left in the car by Drivers or Riders. By using the Lyft Platform, Lyft
                        Services, Third-Party Services, and participating in the Rideshare Services, you agree to accept
                        such risks and agree that Lyft is not responsible for the acts or omissions of Users on the Lyft
                        Platform, Lyft Services, Third-Party Services, or participating in the Rideshare Services.
You are responsible for the use of your User account and Lyft expressly disclaims any liability
                        arising from the unauthorized use of your User account.
It is possible for others to obtain information about you that you provide, publish or post to
                        or through the Lyft Platform (including any profile information you provide), send to other
                        Users, or share during the Rideshare Services, and to use such information to harass or harm
                        you. We are not responsible for the use of any personal information that you disclose to other
                        Users on the Lyft Platform or through the Rideshare Services, Lyft Services, or Third-Party
                        Services. Please carefully select the type of information that you post on the Lyft Platform or
                        through the Rideshare Services, Lyft Services, or Third-Party Services or release to others. We
                        disclaim all liability, regardless of the form of action, for the acts or omissions of other
                        Users (including unauthorized users, or “hackers”).
Opinions, advice, statements, offers, or other information or content concerning Lyft or made
                        available through the Lyft Platform, but not directly by us, are those of their respective
                        authors, and should not necessarily be relied upon. Such authors are solely responsible for such
                        content. Under no circumstances will we be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from
                        your reliance on information or other content posted by third parties, whether on the Lyft
                        Platform or otherwise. We reserve the right, but we have no obligation, to monitor the materials
                        posted on the Lyft Platform and remove any such material that in our sole opinion violates, or
                        is alleged to violate, the law or this Agreement or which might be offensive, illegal, or that
                        might violate the rights of, harm, or threaten the safety of Users or others.
Location data provided by the Lyft Platform is for basic location purposes only and is not
                        intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where
                        erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, or
                        property or environmental damage. Neither Lyft, nor any of its content providers, guarantees the
                        availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data tracked or
                        displayed by the Lyft Platform. Any of your Information, including geolocational data, you
                        upload, provide, or post on the Lyft Platform may be accessible to Lyft and certain Users of the
                        Lyft Platform.
Lyft advises you to use the Lyft Platform with a data plan with unlimited or very high data
                        usage limits, and Lyft shall not be responsible or liable for any fees, costs, or overage
                        charges associated with any data plan you use to access the Lyft Platform.
This paragraph applies to any version of the Lyft Platform that you acquire from the Apple App
                        Store. This Agreement is entered into between you and Lyft. Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) is not a party
                        to this Agreement and shall have no obligations with respect to the Lyft Platform. Lyft, not
                        Apple, is solely responsible for the Lyft Platform and the content thereof as set forth
                        hereunder. However, Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this
                        Agreement. Upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple shall have the right (and will be
                        deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party
                        beneficiary thereof. This Agreement incorporates by reference
Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement
, for purposes of which, you are “the end-user.” In the event of a conflict in the terms of the
                        Licensed Application End User License Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
                        shall control.
As a Driver, you may be able to use "Lyft Nav built by Google" while providing Rideshare
                        Services on the Lyft Platform. Riders and Drivers may also use Google Maps while using the Lyft
                        Platform. In either case, you agree that Google may collect your location data when the Lyft
                        Platform is running in order to provide and improve Google's services, that such data may also
                        be shared with Lyft in order to improve its operations, and that Google's
terms
and
privacy policy
will apply to
                        this usage.
As a Rider seeking Rideshare Services on the Lyft Platform, you may be matched with a
                        professionally licensed or otherwise permitted Rideshare Provider who may be subject to state
                        and local regulations, including requirements to carry commercial automobile insurance. Subject
                        to applicable law, in select markets, Lyft may not provide insurance coverage for instances of
                        Rideshare Services provided by these professionally licensed or otherwise permitted Rideshare
                        Providers.
Lyft shall not be in breach of this Agreement nor liable for failure or delay in performing
                        obligations under this Agreement if such failure or delay results from events, circumstances or
                        causes beyond its reasonable control including (without limitation) natural disasters or acts of
                        God; labor disputes or stoppages; war; government action; epidemic or pandemic; chemical or
                        biological contamination; strikes; riots; acts of domestic or international terrorism;
                        quarantines; national or regional emergencies; or any other cause, whether similar in kind to
                        the foregoing or otherwise, beyond the party’s reasonable control. All service dates under this
                        Agreement affected by force majeure shall be tolled for the duration of such force majeure. The
                        parties hereby agree, when feasible, not to cancel but reschedule the pertinent obligations as
                        soon as practicable after the force majeure condition ceases to exist.
State and Local Disclosures
Certain jurisdictions require additional disclosures to you, such as requirements for drivers,
                        earnings information, and where you can access Lyft’s certificates of insurance. You can view
                        any disclosures required by your local jurisdiction at

                        accepting this Agreement, you acknowledge that Lyft has provided these disclosures to you and
                        that you have read them. Please check regularly for updates.

You will indemnify and hold harmless and, at Lyft’s election, defend Lyft including our

                        that any materials or Information that you submit to us or transmit through the Lyft Platform or

                        or other intellectual property or other rights of any third party; (4) your ownership, use or
                        operation of a motor vehicle or passenger vehicle, including your provision of Rideshare

                        without Lyft’s prior written consent, agree to any settlement on behalf of any Indemnified Party
                        which includes either the obligation to pay any monetary amounts, or any admissions of
                        liability, whether civil or criminal, on the part of any Indemnified Party.

                        AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE LYFT
                        PLATFORM MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE TRANSPORTATION, GOODS, OR THIRD-PARTY
                        SERVICES WITH THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT LYFT HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY

This Agreement is effective upon your acceptance of this Agreement. This Agreement may be
                        terminated: (a) by User, without cause, upon seven (7) days’ prior written notice to Lyft; or

                        Agreement, including but not limited to any breach of Section 9 or breach of Section 10(a)-(i)
                        of this Agreement. In addition, Lyft may terminate this Agreement or deactivate your User

                        the event: (1) you are no longer eligible to qualify as a User; (2) you no longer qualify to
                        provide Rideshare Services or to operate the approved vehicle under applicable law, rule,

                        above, you will be given notice of the potential or actual deactivation and an opportunity to

                        satisfaction, this Agreement will not be permanently terminated. Sections 2, 6, 7 (with respect
                        to the license), 11-12, and 14-22 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement
(a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Lyft.
YOU AND LYFT MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT
                        OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY ARBITRATION, as set forth below.
                        This agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
                        (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, including both the FAA’s procedural and substantive provisions. If
                        the FAA is inapplicable for any reason, then this Arbitration Agreement is governed by the laws
                        of the State of Delaware, including the procedural and substantive provisions of Del. Code tit.
                        10, § 5701 et seq., without regard to choice of law principles. For the avoidance of doubt, a
                        court may neither refuse to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, nor refuse to stay arbitration
                        proceedings, pursuant to state law that is inconsistent with the FAA or Delaware law (including,
                        for example, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.2(c).) This Arbitration
                        Agreement survives after the Agreement terminates or your relationship with Lyft ends. ANY
                        ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND
                        CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. Except as expressly provided below, this Arbitration Agreement
                        applies to all Claims (defined below) between you and Lyft (as defined above) as well as between
                        you and our successors and assigns, employees, agents or shareholders. This Arbitration
                        Agreement also applies to claims between you and Lyft’s service providers, including but not
                        limited to background check providers and payment processors; and such service providers shall
                        be considered intended third-party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.
Except as expressly provided below, ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US (EACH A “CLAIM” AND
                        COLLECTIVELY, “CLAIMS”) SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. These Claims
                        include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past,
                        present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions
                        thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof),
                        the Lyft Platform, the Rideshare Services, the Lyft Services, Lyft promotions, gift card,
                        referrals or loyalty programs, the Lyft Tablet, any other goods or services made available
                        through the Lyft Platform by Lyft or a third-party provider, your relationship with Lyft, the
                        threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User account or this
                        Agreement, criminal background checks and driving history checks performed by or on Lyft’s
                        behalf, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any promotions or
                        offers made by Lyft, any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law, trade secrets, unfair
                        competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination,
                        discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, emotional distress, breach of any
                        express or implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer
                        protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone
                        Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Uniform
                        Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination
                        in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor
                        Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (except for individual claims for
                        employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Lyft and covered by the Employee
                        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any,
                        addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and
                        common law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes
                        about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration
                        Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND LYFT ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
                        COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS
                        ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every
                        claim or dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by
                        the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from the requirement to
                        arbitrate.
(b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND LYFT MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE
                        OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE
                        BASIS (“CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND LYFT BOTH ARE WAIVING THE
                        RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
                        CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SUBSECTION
                        (B) SHALL NOT APPLY TO REPRESENTATIVE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST LYFT,
                        WHICH ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY IN SECTION 17(C). ALSO NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES
                        MAY AGREE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-WIDE SETTLEMENT.
The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on
                        any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or
                        resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. The
                        arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
                        seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's
                        individual claims.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the American
                        Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or
                        enforceability of this subsection (b) may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator.
                        In any case in which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action
                        or otherwise seeks relief that is not limited to the individual party seeking relief, and (2)
                        there is a final judicial determination that this subsection (b) is unenforceable with respect
                        to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim (such as a request for public injunctive
                        relief), then that Claim or particular remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall
                        be severed from any remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a court of competent
                        jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver and all other provisions in this subsection (b) shall
                        be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims or remedies to the
                        fullest extent possible. The Parties agree that a court will decide any Claim or any particular
                        remedy for a Claim severed from any arbitration only after the completion of that arbitration.
(c) Representative PAGA Waiver.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, to the
                        fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Lyft agree not to bring a representative action on
                        behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code
                        § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                        attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Lyft agree that any
                        such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve
                        whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such
                        an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or
                        collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject
                        to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA
                        Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of
                        this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction
                        and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                        unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from
                        this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on
                        the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims or portions of Claims be
                        arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such
                        representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims or portions of
                        such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
                        To the extent that there are any Claims or portions of Claims to be litigated in a civil court
                        of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
                        representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims or portions of Claims,
                        the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims or portions of Claims shall be stayed pending
                        the outcome of any individual Claims or portions of Claims in arbitration.
(d) Pre-Arbitration Process.
A party who intends to initiate arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of the
                        dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must (1) describe the factual and legal nature and basis of the
                        claim or dispute; (2) set forth the specific relief sought; and (3) include the name, mailing
                        and email addresses, and phone number of the party sending the Notice.
Your Notice to Lyft must be personally signed by you (and by your attorney if you are
                        represented by counsel). Lyft’s notice to you must be personally signed by a Lyft representative
                        (and Lyft’s attorney if Lyft is represented by counsel). To safeguard your User Account, you
                        might be required to provide both your authentication and consent for us to discuss your User
                        Account or share your User Account information with anyone but you, including an attorney
                        (“Authentication and Consent”).
Your Notice to Lyft should be sent by email to disputenotice@lyft.com. Lyft’s notice to you will
                        be sent by email to the most recent contact information that you have provided to Lyft.
Whoever sends the Notice must give the other party 60 days from receipt of the complete Notice
                        (including the Authentication and Consent, if required) to investigate the claim before
                        commencing an arbitration. The submission of a complete Notice will toll any applicable statute
                        of limitations or other limitations period for the claims and requested relief in the Notice
                        until 60 days from when the other party receives the Notice of Dispute.
This Pre-Arbitration Process is essential so that you and Lyft have a meaningful chance to
                        resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court can
                        enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration or assessment or collection of any
                        arbitration fees in connection with such an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law,
                        the American Arbitration Association (or any other arbitration provider selected by the parties)
                        may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with such an arbitration. If
                        the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed. If a process arbitrator has been
                        appointed at the request of a party, the process arbitrator also has the same authority as a
                        court to enforce the requirement that arbitration not be commenced until the requirements of
                        this Section 17(d) have been satisfied.
(e) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the
                        AAA pursuant to its
Consumer Arbitration Rules
, and, if applicable, its Mass
                        Arbitration Supplementary Rules, that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated
                        (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of the AAA rules
                        can be obtained at the AAA’s website (
www.adr.org
).
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and
                        circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                        different set of AAA Rules, but in no event, unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, shall the
                        arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of
                        representative, collective, or class proceeding. The parties may select a different arbitration
                        administrator, forum, and/or third party neutral upon mutual written agreement. If the AAA is
                        unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, you and Lyft
                        will select another arbitration provider, forum, and/or third party neutral upon mutual written
                        agreement. If there is no agreement, a court will do so.
As part of the arbitration, both you and Lyft will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery
                        of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. Except as specified in subsections
                        (b) and (c) above, the arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available
                        in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
                        individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
                        that party's individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the
                        arbitrator’s decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on
                        which the decision is based.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and
                        will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
                        rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in
                        prior arbitrations involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                        The arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different Riders or
                        Drivers. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by
                        the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award
                        may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(f) Arbitration Fees and Awards.
The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA Rules subject to
                        the following modifications:
If Lyft initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Lyft will pay all AAA filing
                            and arbitration fees.
With respect to any Claims brought by Lyft against a Driver, or for Claims brought by a
                            Driver against Lyft that: (A) are based on an alleged employment relationship between Lyft
                            and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s actual deactivation of a Driver’s User
                            account or a threat by Lyft to deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or
                            relate to, Lyft’s actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with Lyft under the termination
                            provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Lyft to terminate a Driver’s Agreement; (D)
                            arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including Lyft’s commission
                            or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly guarantees owed by Lyft to Drivers for
                            Rideshare Services, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other Lyft promotions,
                            or consumer-type disputes, or (E) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in
                            connection with a user seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections
                            (A)-(E) shall be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”), Lyft shall pay all costs
                            unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a
                            court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the extent not
                            paid by Lyft pursuant to the fee provisions above). However, if you are the party initiating
                            the Driver Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the
                            filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in
                            the state in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would
                            be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (f)(1) above. Any
                            dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator.
                            For purposes of this Section 17(f)(2), the term “Driver” shall be deemed to include both
                            Drivers and Driver applicants who have not been approved to drive.
Unless applicable law provides otherwise, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and
                            pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would
                            incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or
                            documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
                            Notwithstanding the foregoing, an arbitrator may award costs as provided in Federal Rule of
                            Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents (which the parties agree shall apply in
                            arbitration).
At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any
                            portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.
Although under some laws Lyft may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and non-filing
                            fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Lyft agrees that it will not seek such an
                            award from you unless you are represented by an attorney or the arbitrator has determined
                            that you or your counsel have violated the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
                            11(b), which the parties agree shall be applicable in arbitration.
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Lyft’s last written
                            settlement offer made after you fully complied with the Pre-Arbitration Process described in
                            subsection (d) above, then Lyft will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000,
                            whichever is greater. In determining whether you are entitled to the minimum $1,000 payment,
                            the arbitrator shall not consider amounts offered or awarded for attorneys’ fees or costs.
(g) Location and Manner of Arbitration.
Unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, the arbitration hearing, if any, between Lyft and a Rider
                        will take place in the county of your billing address or by videoconference, and the arbitration
                        hearing, if any, between Lyft and a Driver will take place in the county in which the Driver
                        provides Rideshare Services or by videoconference. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your
                        county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for an AAA
                        arbitration. Your right to the hearing and the format of the hearing will be determined by the
                        AAA Rules. You and Lyft agree that you and a Lyft representative will personally appear (which
                        can include appearance by videoconference) at the hearing (along with your and Lyft’s respective
                        legal counsel, if the parties are represented by counsel).
(h) Additional Procedures for Coordinated Claims.
If 25 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and
                        are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are
                        submitted simultaneously), the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by this
                        Arbitration Agreement, shall apply, and all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in
                        stages using bellwether proceedings if they are not resolved during the Pre-Arbitration Process.
                        You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first
                        stage, each side shall select up to 20 cases (40 cases total) to be filed in arbitration. The
                        cases shall be resolved individually by different arbitrators to the extent that the AAA has a
                        sufficient number of arbitrators available. If the AAA does not have a sufficient number of
                        available arbitrators to decide all of the cases filed, the AAA may assign multiple cases to the
                        same arbitrator, but the arbitrator must still resolve each case individually. In the meantime,
                        no other cases may be filed in arbitration, and the AAA shall not accept, administer, or demand
                        payment of fees for arbitrations commenced in violation of this subsection 17(h).
After the first stage is completed, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all
                        remaining cases, and Lyft will pay the mediation fee. The parties shall attempt to reach
                        agreement on a mutually agreeable mediator. If the parties cannot reach an agreement, AAA will
                        oversee a rank and strike process with the parties and, if no agreeable mediator is chosen, AAA
                        may administratively appoint a mediator. If the parties cannot agree how to resolve the
                        remaining cases after the conclusion of the first stage of bellwether proceedings, the process
                        will be repeated until all claims are resolved, except that in the second and later stages each
                        side shall select up to 50 cases (100 cases total) to be filed in arbitration. Between stages,
                        counsel for the parties shall meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the
                        staged proceedings, including whether to further increase the number of cases filed in each
                        stage.
If this subsection 17(h) applies to a Notice, the statute of limitations applicable to the
                        claims and relief set forth in that Notice shall be tolled from the date the Notice is sent
                        until that Notice is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A
                        court will have authority to enforce this subsection 17(h), including to enjoin the filing,
                        assessing or demanding fees for, administration of, or prosecution of arbitrations. To the
                        fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the parties consent to the jurisdiction and venue of
                        the courts in San Francisco County, California, to enforce this subsection 17(h).
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, if either
                        party requests appointment of a process arbitrator, a process arbitrator may decide issues
                        relating to compliance with the requirements of subsection 17(d) above or this subsection 17(h),
                        or the issues that a process arbitrator may decide under Rule MA-6 of the AAA’s Mass Arbitration
                        Supplementary Rules.
This subsection 17(h) and each of its requirements are intended to be severable from the rest of
                        this Arbitration Agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court decides that the
                        staging process in this subsection 17(h) is not enforceable, then the cases may be filed in
                        arbitration.
(i) Exceptions to Arbitration.
This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1)
                        small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small
                        claims court’s jurisdiction, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of
                        general jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or
                        other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section
                        17(c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under
                        applicable law not preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability
                        insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration
                        as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and (5) individual claims of
                        sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection with the use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft
                        Services, or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are brought in a court of competent
                        jurisdiction consistent with Section 18, Lyft will not require arbitration of those claims.
                        Lyft’s agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not waive the enforceability of
                        any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement (including without limitation the waivers
                        provided in Section 17(b)), or of the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any
                        other dispute, claim, or controversy.
Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or
                        charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities
                        Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”), or Office of Federal Contract
                        Compliance Programs, or similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration
                        Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim
                        before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies
                        before making a claim in arbitration However, should you bring an administrative claim, you may
                        only seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement, and you
                        knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant
                        to any administrative complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB. Should you
                        participate in an NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not
                        arise from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Agreement or
                        settled by you. Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this Arbitration Agreement if
                        you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration
                        Agreement prevents your participation in an investigation by a government agency of any report,
                        claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement.
(j) Severability.
Except as otherwise provided in the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c) above, in
                        the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable
                        under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder
                        of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.
(k) Driver Claims in Pending Settlement.
If you are a member of a putative class in a lawsuit against Lyft involving Driver Claims and a
                        Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Settlement has been filed with the court in that lawsuit
                        prior to this Agreement’s effective date (a “Pending Settlement Action”), then this Arbitration
                        Agreement shall not apply to your Driver Claims in that particular class action. Instead, your
                        Driver Claims in that Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration
                        provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you accepted prior to this Agreement’s
                        effective date.
(l) Opting Out of Arbitration for Driver Claims That Are Not in a Pending Settlement Action.
As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate Driver Claims
                        defined in Section 17(f)(2) (except as limited by Section 17(k) above) pursuant to the terms of
                        this subsection if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in Lyft’s Terms of
                        Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have
                        previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your
                        prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified below, but opting out
                        of this arbitration provision has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration
                        agreements that you may have with Lyft. If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration
                        provision and do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver
                        Claims, you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such Driver Claims, other than those in a
                        Pending Settlement Action, by notifying Lyft in writing of your desire to opt out of arbitration
                        for such Driver Claims, which writing must be dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to
                        arbitrationoptout@lyft.com.
In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of this
                        Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending Settlement
                        Action, (B) the writing must include the name, phone number, and email address associated with
                        your User Account, and (C) the email containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days
                        after the date this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the 30-day
                        period, you and Lyft shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement in full
                        (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending Settlement Action). As
                        provided in paragraph 17(k) above, any opt out that you submit shall not apply to any Driver
                        Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action and your Driver Claims in any such Pending
                        Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions that are contained
                        in the applicable Lyft Terms of Use that you agreed to prior to the effective date of this
                        Agreement.
Cases have been filed against Lyft and may be filed in the future involving Driver Claims. You
                        should assume that there are now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against Lyft alleging
                        class, collective, and/or representative Driver Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on
                        your behalf, and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you
                        do agree to arbitration of Driver Claims with Lyft under this Arbitration Agreement, you are
                        agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief,
                        against Lyft in an individual arbitration, except for the Driver Claims that are part of a
                        Pending Settlement Action. You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or
                        seek to recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class,
                        collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your
                        choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not be subject to retaliation if you
                        exercise your right to assert claims or opt out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration
                        Agreement.
(m) Binding Effect; Third-Party Beneficiaries.
This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by or
                        against any third parties, including but not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party
                        beneficiaries and permitted assigns, where their underlying claim(s) arise out of or relate to
                        your use of the Lyft Platform, Lyft Services, or Rideshare Services. To the extent that any
                        third-party beneficiary to this Agreement brings claims against a party, those claims shall also
                        be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
Choice of Forum and Class-Action and Coordinated-Action Waiver for Non-Arbitrated Claims
Claims (1) excepted from arbitration by, and brought consistent with, Section 17(i) or (2)
                        otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be subject to arbitration,
                        shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts in the state in which the incident
                        or accident underlying the plaintiff's claim(s) occurred, notwithstanding that other courts may
                        have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims or personal jurisdiction over the parties.
If for any reason claims do not proceed in arbitration, such claims may be brought and litigated
                        on an individual basis only. On an individual basis means that you cannot bring such claims as a
                        class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass, multi-plaintiff, joint, and/or
                        representative action against Lyft, or otherwise seek to include your claims or case in a
                        pending class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass, multi-plaintiff, joint, and/or
                        representative action against Lyft. No action brought by you may be consolidated or joined in
                        any fashion with any other proceeding, except that the parties may agree to participate in a
                        class-wide settlement. The interpretation, enforceability, and validity of this paragraph shall
                        be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to choice of law principles, and
                        by any applicable federal law. If Delaware law is inapplicable for any reason, then the
                        interpretation, enforceability, and validity of this paragraph shall be governed by the law of
                        the state where the court of competent jurisdiction deciding the claims is located. If there is
                        a final judicial determination that any part of this paragraph is unenforceable or unlawful for
                        any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful portion shall be severed and severance shall have no
                        effect whatsoever on the enforceability, applicability, or validity of any other part of this
                        Agreement, including without limitation the choice-of-forum provision in the preceding
                        paragraph.
Confidentiality
You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and confidential
                        information relating to Lyft’s business, operations and properties, information about a User
                        made available to you in connection with such User’s use of the Lyft Platform, which may include
                        the User’s name, pick-up location, contact information and photo (“Confidential Information”)
                        disclosed to you by Lyft for your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein.
                        You shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties,
                        and you agree not to store separate and outside of the Lyft Platform any Confidential
                        Information obtained from the Lyft Platform. As a Driver, you understand that some of the
                        Confidential Information you receive may be protected by federal and/or state confidentiality
                        laws, such as the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”),
                        governing the privacy and security of protected (patient) health information. You understand
                        that any violation of the Agreement’s confidentiality provisions may violate HIPAA or other
                        federal and/or state confidentiality laws and could result in civil or criminal penalties
                        against you. You will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid
                        disclosure or use of Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the
                        public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have liability to Lyft with regard to
                        any Confidential Information which you can prove: was in the public domain at the time it was
                        disclosed by Lyft or has entered the public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you,
                        without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the
                        time of disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of Lyft; becomes known to you,
                        without restriction, from a source other than Lyft without breach of this Agreement by you and
                        otherwise not in violation of Lyft’s rights; or is disclosed pursuant to the order or
                        requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however,
                        that you shall provide prompt notice of such court order or requirement to Lyft to enable Lyft
                        to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.
Relationship with Lyft
As a Driver on the Lyft Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you and Lyft are in a direct
                        business relationship, and the relationship between the parties under this Agreement is solely
                        that of independent contracting parties. You and Lyft expressly agree that (1) this is not an
                        employment agreement and does not create an employment relationship between you and Lyft; and
                        (2) no joint venture, franchisor-franchisee, partnership, or agency relationship is intended or
                        created by this Agreement. You have no authority to bind Lyft, and you will not hold yourself
                        out as an employee, agent or authorized representative of Lyft.
Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your
                        performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with your provision of
                        Rideshare Services, your acts or omissions, or your operation and maintenance of your vehicle.
                        You retain the sole right to determine when, where, and for how long you will use the Lyft
                        Platform. Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, unilaterally prescribe specific dates,
                        times of day, or any minimum number of hours for you to use the Lyft Platform. You retain the
                        option to accept or to decline or ignore a Rider’s request for Rideshare Services via the Lyft
                        Platform, or to cancel an accepted request for Rideshare Services via the Lyft Platform, subject
                        to Lyft’s then-current cancellation policies. Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, require
                        you to accept any specific request for Rideshare Services as a condition of maintaining access
                        to the platform. With the exception of any signage required by law or permit/license rules or
                        requirements, Lyft shall have no right to require you to: (a) display Lyft’s names, logos or
                        colors on your vehicle(s); or (b) wear a uniform or any other clothing displaying Lyft’s names,
                        logos or colors. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion to provide
                        Rideshare Services or otherwise engage in any other business or employment activities, including
                        but not limited to providing services similar to the Rideshare Services to other companies, and
                        that Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, restrict you from engaging in any such activity.
Third-Party Services
In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the Lyft Platform may enable Users to provide
                        services or receive services from other third parties. For example, Users may be able to use the
                        Lyft Platform to plan and reserve rides on public transportation, take a ride in an Autonomous
                        Vehicle provided by a third party, rent vehicles, bikes, scooters, or other similar personal
                        transportation devices provided by a third party, receive roadside assistance, or obtain
                        financial, vehicle repair, insurance, or other services provided by third parties (collectively,
                        the “Third-Party Services”). This Agreement between you and Lyft governs your use of the Lyft
                        Platform in connection with the Third-Party Services.
In addition, you understand that the Third-Party Services may also be subject to terms and
                        pricing of the third-party provider (collectively, the “Third-Party Terms”) which will govern
                        your relationship with such third-party provider, as applicable. You agree that Lyft is not
                        responsible and may not be held liable for the Third-Party Services or the actions or omissions
                        of the third-party provider. Such Third-Party Services may not be investigated, monitored or
                        checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by Lyft, and Lyft is not responsible for
                        any Third-Party Services accessed through the Lyft Platform. This Agreement incorporates by
                        reference
ADT Mobile Security Monitoring Terms
, which are Third-Party Terms.
In the event of a conflict in the terms of any Third-Party Terms and this Agreement, the terms
                        of this Agreement shall control with respect to Lyft and your agreements with Lyft herein, and
                        the limitations of liability set forth in Section 15 above shall also apply to the third-party
                        provider. The Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement provisions in Section 17 above shall
                        apply instead of any terms in any Third-Party Terms for all purposes except with respect to
                        claims that are solely against the third-party provider.
General
Except as provided in Sections 17 and 18, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
                        State of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of law provision is
                        only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret this Agreement and is not
                        intended to create any other substantive right to non-Californians to assert claims under
                        California law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. If any provision of this Agreement
                        is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of
                        this Agreement. In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision
                        with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a
                        similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this
                        Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and all incorporated agreements may be automatically
                        assigned by Lyft, in our sole discretion by providing notice to you. You may not assign this
                        Agreement without Lyft’s prior written approval. Any purported assignment by you in violation of
                        this Section 22 shall be void. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Lyft shall
                        be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to Lyft, Inc., 548
                        Market Street, #68514 San Francisco, CA 94104. Any notices to you shall be provided to you
                        through the Lyft Platform or given to you via the email address or physical address you provide
                        to Lyft during the registration process. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way
                        define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. The words “include”,
                        “includes” and “including” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” A
                        party’s failure to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver
                        of the party’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches, any such waiver
                        shall be in writing. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between
                        you and Lyft with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous
                        understandings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written.

The Information We Collect
When you use the Lyft Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and
                    information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like service
                    providers, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other
                    information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:
A. Information You Provide to Us
Your Account.
When you create an account with Lyft, we collect the information
                        you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, and
                        payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your profile, like
                        saved addresses (e.g., home or work) and gender, and set up other preferences (such as your
                        preferred pronouns). We may ask at the time you set up an account and thereafter that you
                        provide additional information related to the identity of your account, such as documents
                        related to identification (e.g., driver’s license), a profile picture, or “selfie” imagery. If
                        you choose to engage in additional offerings on the Lyft Platform (e.g., linking to other
                        accounts like travel rewards), you may provide us additional information relevant to those
                        offerings.
Driver Information.
If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the
                        information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number,
                        birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social
                        security number), driver’s license information (including gender), vehicle information, and car
                        insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank
                        routing numbers and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for
                        additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and
                        programs relevant to that location.
User Content.
When you rate and provide feedback about the Lyft Platform
                        (including about Riders or Drivers), we collect all of the information you provide in your
                        feedback. When you contact us or we contact you, including through surveys or research projects,
                        we collect any information that you provide, including the contents of the messages or
                        attachments you send us. Users may choose to send us audio and video content, including in-ride
                        recordings that may be initiated through the Lyft app.
B. Information We Collect When You Use the Lyft Platform
Location Information.
The Lyft Platform collects location information. This
                        includes approximate and precise location through GPS and WiFi data, IP address, Bluetooth data,
                        and any other location information you choose to share with us. Our processing of this
                        information differs depending on your Lyft app settings, device permissions, and whether you are
                        using the platform as a Rider or Driver:
Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the Lyft app,
                            including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until
                            it ends. You may otherwise choose to allow Lyft to collect your device’s precise location if
                            you explicitly grant permission to enable certain products or features. Lyft also tracks the
                            precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.
Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including
                            while the app is running in the background. We also collect precise location for a limited
                            time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting
                            it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active. If you choose to install a
                            Lyft Platform device in or on your vehicle (e.g., a Lyft dashboard device or a tablet), that
                            device may collect precise location information when turned on.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your use of the Lyft Platform,
                        including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and
                        whether you used a promotional or referral code. Our e-bikes and scooters may collect mobile
                        sensor data, such as speed, direction, altitude, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical
                        data. We also collect information about your interactions with the Lyft Platform like our apps
                        and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.
Device Information.
We collect information about the devices you use to access
                        the Lyft Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating
                        system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings
                        (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising
                        identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor
                        data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other
                        technical data). If you have installed a Lyft Platform device in your vehicle (e.g., a Lyft
                        dashboard device or tablet), that device may similarly collect sensor data and other information
                        like location, as described when you choose and set up such devices. If a Driver chooses to
                        register with Lyft that they use a dashboard recording device, we will receive the information
                        they provide to us about that device (e.g., device serial number).
Communications Between Riders and Drivers.
We work with a third party to
                        facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either
                        party’s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the
                        communication service, we collect information about these communications and Lyft Platform chat
                        communications, including the participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents
                        of SMS and chat messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of
                        phone calls made through the Lyft Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do
                        so before the call begins.
Address Book Contacts.
You may set your device permissions to grant Lyft access
                        to your contact lists and direct Lyft to access your contact list, for example to help you refer
                        friends to Lyft. If you choose to do this, we will access the names and contact information of
                        the people in your address book.
Calendar Information.
You may set your device permissions or otherwise grant
                        Lyft access to your chosen calendar and direct Lyft to access calendar information, for example
                        to help you get alerts to order a ride for your upcoming trip. If you choose to do this, we will
                        access and store information available in your calendar to use in providing you these optional
                        features. Lyft will adhere to the applicable calendar provider policies, including
Google’s API Services User Data Policy
, which impose certain limitations on the use of data collected from user’s calendar accounts.
                        You may remove Lyft’s access to your accounts at any time either in-app or through your account
                        provider settings.
Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies.
We collect and use
                        information through the use of “cookies,” tracking pixels, data analytics tools like
Google Analytics
, SDKs, and
                        other third-party tracking technologies on and off the Lyft Platform to understand how you
                        navigate through the Lyft Platform and interact with advertisements, to make your Lyft
                        experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your experience with us, to serve
                        you or others better ads, and to save your preferences.
Inferences.
We may infer certain information from your interactions with the
                        Lyft Platform and other personal information available to us. For example, if you frequently
                        ride to or from airports, we may infer you are a frequent traveler. We may infer your
                        approximate location from your precise location. We may also draw inferences from the
                        information you provide to us, such as inferring your gender based on your first name.
C. Information We Collect From Other Sources
Service Providers and Other Parties.
Service providers and other parties
                        provide us with information needed for core aspects of the Lyft Platform, as well as for
                        additional services, programs, loyalty benefits, and promotions that can enhance your Lyft
                        experience. These service providers and other parties include background check providers,
                        insurance partners, financial service providers, marketing providers, and other businesses. We
                        obtain the following information about you from these parties:

Information to operationalize loyalty and promotional/marketing programs or applications,

Concierge Service.
Sometimes another business or entity may order you a Lyft
                        ride. If an organization has ordered a ride for you using our Concierge service, they will
                        provide us your contact information and the pickup and drop-off location of your ride.
Referral Programs.
If someone refers you to Lyft, we will collect information
                        about you from that referral including your name and contact information.

How We Disclose Your Information
We do not sell your personal information to third parties for money -- no one can buy the personal
                    information we collect from and about you and we do not act as a data broker. However, we may need
                    to share your personal information with third parties to deliver relevant personalized ads to you on
                    and off the Lyft Platform. Some of these disclosures may constitute “sharing” or the “sale” of
                    personal information for “targeted advertising” purposes under certain local (e.g., U.S. state)
                    privacy laws, which we describe in more detail
here
. This section otherwise explains when, why,
                    and with whom we disclose your information.
A. Sharing Between Lyft Users
Riders and Drivers.
Rider information shared with Driver:
As part of surfacing the ride request and
                        enabling the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup and destination, location, name,
                        profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider),
                        and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns) as well as
                        any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Lyft app. Once the ride is finished, we also
                        eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s
                        identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be
                        able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)
Driver information shared with Rider:
Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will
                        share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time
                        location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in
                        the Driver’s Lyft profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why
                        you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).
Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not
                        share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users when enabling this.
                        If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or
                        Driver, which may include sharing actual contact information with your consent.
Shared Ride Riders.
When Riders use a Lyft shared ride, we share each Rider’s
                        name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off
                        locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.
Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.
Some rides may be requested or paid for
                        by others. If a ride is requested or taken using a Lyft Business Profile account; a pass, code
                        or coupon; a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government); a corporate credit card linked to
                        another account; or another user or entity otherwise requests or pays for or portion of a ride,
                        we may share some or all of that ride’s details with that other party, including rider and
                        driver information (e.g., name, rider phone number), the date, time, charge, region of trip,
                        pick up and drop off location of the ride, feedback and rating regarding the ride, and
                        information related to incidents and accidents that may have occurred.
Linked Accounts and Sharing Upon Your Request.
If you use the Lyft Platform as
                        part of a Lyft Family account linked with others or if you direct us to share your information
                        with trusted contacts, we will then share with those parties information about your use of the
                        Lyft Platform, such as the live location of your ride.
Referral Programs.
If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let them
                        know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information
                        about your use of the Lyft Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a
                        bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive
                        such information.
B. Disclosures to Service Providers to Provide the Lyft Platform, and Other Parties
Depending on whether you’re a Rider or a Driver, Lyft may disclose the following categories of
                        your personal information to provide you with a variety of the Lyft Platform’s features and
                        services:

                            birth, government identification number (including social security number)), driver’s
                            license information and image, profile photo, “selfie” photos and imagery, vehicle

                            information you provide us;
Commercial information, such as ride information, Driver/Rider statistics and feedback, and
                            Driver/Rider transaction and ride history;

                            browser, version of operating system, carrier and/or manufacturer, device identifiers, and
                            mobile and other forms of advertising identifiers;
Location data;
Inferences we may make from your interactions with the Lyft Platform and other personal
                            information available to us; and
This and other information you may direct us to disclose to other parties, such as when you
                            choose to link your Lyft account with a separate travel rewards program or when you choose
                            to engage with an offering from another company through the Lyft Platform.

Providing financing;
Providing requested emergency services;
Providing analytics services to and by Lyft; and
Undertaking research to develop and improve the Lyft Platform.
C. For Legal Reasons and to Protect the Lyft Platform
We may disclose your personal information in response to a legal obligation, or if we have
                        determined that disclosing your personal information is reasonably necessary or appropriate to:
Comply with any applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation, civil, criminal or
                            regulatory inquiry, investigation or legal process, enforceable governmental request, or
                            requirement as condition to operate (e.g., operating permit, license or agreement);
Respond to legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena, summons, or court order);
Enforce our Terms of Service;

                            safety or the rights, property, interests, or safety of you, third parties, or the public as
                            required or permitted by law.
D. In Connection with Sale or Merger

                        corporate control such as a restructuring, merger, or sale of our assets.
E. Upon Your Further Direction
With your permission or upon your direction, we may disclose your personal information to
                        interact with a third party or for other purposes.
How We Store and Protect Your Information
We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Lyft
                    Platform. This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We
                    retain transactional information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure we
                    can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. We also retain
                    your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our
                    terms and policies. If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in
                    the “Deleting Your Account” section below.
We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information. But no
                    security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information,
                    including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.
Your Rights And Choices Regarding Your Data
As explained more below and on our
privacy homepage
,
                    Lyft provides ways for you to access and delete your personal information as well as exercise
                    applicable data rights that give you certain control over your personal information.
A. All Users
Email Subscriptions.
You can always unsubscribe from our commercial or
                        promotional emails by clicking unsubscribe in those messages. We will still send you
                        transactional and relational emails about your use of the Lyft Platform.
Text Messages.
You can opt out of receiving commercial or promotional text
                        messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. You may
                        also opt out of receiving all texts from Lyft (including transactional or relational messages)
                        by texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. Note that
                        opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use of the Lyft Platform. Drivers can also opt
                        out of driver-specific messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS. To re-enable texts
                        you can text START in response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.
Push Notifications.
You can opt out of receiving push notifications through
                        your device settings. Please note that opting out of receiving push notifications may impact
                        your use of the Lyft Platform (such as receiving a notification that your ride has arrived).
Profile Information.
You can review and edit certain account information you
                        have chosen to add to your profile by logging in to your account settings and profile.
Location Information.
You can prevent your device from sharing location
                        information through your device’s system settings. But if you do, this may impact Lyft’s ability
                        to provide you our full range of features and services. You may also control some elements of
                        sharing your location with Lyft in your Lyft account settings.
Cookie Tracking and Personalized Advertising.
Your browser and devices may
                        offer some controls regarding personalized advertising. You may also modify your personalized
                        advertising setting
here
. See also the
                        jurisdiction-specific rights as applicable.
Accessing Your Information.
If you would like to access your personal
                        information, please visit
here
. You can also see
                        information we have about you by logging into your account and viewing things like your profile,
                        settings, and preferences (like preferred pronouns and address shortcuts such as home and work),
                        ride history, or payment information. In addition, you may have some information included in
                        things we have sent to you, such as ride receipts.
Deleting Your Account.
If you would like to delete your Lyft account, please
                        visit
here
. In some cases, we will be unable to
                        delete your account, such as if there is an issue with your account related to trust, safety, or
                        fraud. When we delete your account, we may retain certain information for legitimate business
                        purposes or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. For example, we may retain your
                        information to resolve open insurance claims, or we may be obligated to retain your information
                        as part of an open legal claim. When we retain such data, we do so in ways designed to prevent
                        its use for other purposes.

Some states such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota,
                        Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia

Lyft is not directed to children, and we don’t knowingly collect personal information from children
                    under the age of 16. If we find out that a child under 16 has given us personal information, we will
                    take steps to delete that information. If you believe that a child under the age of 16 has given us
                    personal information, please contact us at our
Help Center

Links to Third-Party Websites
The Lyft Platform may contain links or references to third-party websites, products, or services.
                    Those third parties may have privacy policies that differ from ours. We are not responsible for
                    those third parties and their websites, products or services, and we recommend that you review their
                    policies. Please contact those parties directly if you have any questions about their privacy
                    policies.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time as the Lyft Platform changes and privacy law evolves. If
                    we update it, we will do so online, and if we make material changes, we will let you know through

Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.

, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup

on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services

detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
