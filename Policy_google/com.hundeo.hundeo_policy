Relevant legal bases
Below you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. Should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.
Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO)
- The data subject has given his/her consent to the processing of personal data concerning him/her for a specific purpose or purposes.
Contract fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b. DSGVO)
- The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject.
Legal obligation (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c. DSGVO)
- The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO)
- The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.
Application procedure as a pre-contractual or contractual relationship (Art. 9 para. 2 lit. b DSGVO)
- Insofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 (1) of the GDPR (e.g. health data, such as severely disabled status or ethnic origin) are requested from applicants in the context of the application process so that the controller or the data subject can exercise the rights accruing to him or her under employment law and social security and social protection law and fulfill his or her obligations in this regard, their processing shall be carried out in accordance with Article 9 (2) b. DSGVO, in case of protection of vital interests of the applicants or other persons according to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. c. DSGVO or for the purposes of preventive health care or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the employee's ability to work, for medical diagnostics, care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the management of systems and services in the health or social sector pursuant to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h. DSGVO. In the case of a communication of special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their processing is based on Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a. DSGVO.
National data protection regulations in Germany
: In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.
Security measures
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, transfer, safeguarding of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.
IP address shortening
If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service providers and technologies used and the processing of a complete IP address is not required, the IP address is shortened (also referred to as "IP masking"). In this process, the last two digits or the last part of the IP address after a period are removed or replaced by wildcards. The shortening of the IP address is intended to prevent or significantly complicate the identification of a person by means of their IP address.
SSL encryption (https)
To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.
Transmission of personal data
In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.
Data transfer within the organization
We may transfer or grant access to personal data to other entities within our organization. Where this transfer is for administrative purposes, the transfer of data is based on our legitimate business and operational interests or is made where it is necessary for the fulfillment of our contract-related obligations or where there is consent from the data subjects or legal permission.
Data processing in third countries
If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies, this will only be done in accordance with the legal requirements.
Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we only process or have data processed in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the presence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information page of the EU Commission:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de
).
Cookies use
Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after his visit within an online offer. Stored information may include, for example, language settings on a website, login status, a shopping cart, or where a video was watched. The term cookies also includes other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., when user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as "user IDs").
The following cookie types and functions are distinguished:
Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):
Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his browser.
Permanent cookies:
Permanent cookies remain stored even after the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, the interests of users used for reach measurement or marketing purposes can be stored in such a cookie.
First-party cookies:
First-party cookies are set by ourselves.
Third-party cookies (also: third-party cookies)
: Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.
Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies:
On the one hand, cookies may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to store logins or other user input or for security reasons).
Statistics, marketing and personalization cookies
Furthermore, cookies are generally also used in the context of range measurement and when a user's interests or behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) on individual websites are stored in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content that matches their potential interests. This process is also referred to as "tracking", i.e., tracking the potential interests of users. Insofar as we use cookies or "tracking" technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or in the context of obtaining consent.
Notes on legal bases:
The legal basis on which we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask you for consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for the processing of your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online offer and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.
Storage period:
Unless we provide you with explicit information about the storage period of permanent cookies (e.g. in the context of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the storage period can be up to two years.
General information on revocation and objection (opt-out):
Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke any consent given or to object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as "opt-out"). You can initially declare your objection by means of your browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (whereby this may also restrict the functionality of our online offer). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be made by means of a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the web pages
https://optout.aboutads.info
and
https://www.youronlinechoices.com/
be declared. In addition, you can receive further instructions on how to object in the context of the information on the service providers and cookies used.
Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent
We use a cookie consent management procedure in which the consent of users to the use of cookies or the processing and providers named in the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained and managed and revoked by the users. In this context, the declaration of consent is stored in order not to have to repeat its request and to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or with the help of comparable technologies), in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual information on the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of consent can be up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created and stored with the time of consent, information on the scope of consent (e.g., which categories of cookies and/or service providers), as well as the browser, system and end device used.
Types of data processed:
Usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
Affected persons:
Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).
Legal basis:
Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).
Services used and service providers:

Cookie consent management; service provider: Borlabs; website:
https://de.borlabs.io/borlabs-cookie/
An individual user ID, language, types of consent and the time of their submission are stored on the server and in the cookie on the user's device.
Business services
We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g. customers and interested parties (collectively referred to as "contractual partners") in the context of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as related measures and in the context of communication with contractual partners (or pre-contractual), e.g. to answer inquiries.
We process this data for the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, to secure our rights and for the purposes of the administrative tasks associated with this information as well as the entrepreneurial organization. We only disclose the data of the contractual partners to third parties within the scope of applicable law to the extent that this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or for the fulfillment of legal obligations or with the consent of the data subjects (e.g. to participating telecommunications, transport and other auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisors, payment service providers or tax authorities). The contractual partners will be informed about further forms of processing, e.g. for marketing purposes, within the scope of this data protection declaration.
We inform the contractual partners which data are required for the aforementioned purposes before or in the course of data collection, e.g. in online forms, by means of special marking (e.g. colors) or symbols (e.g. asterisks or similar), or in person.
We delete the data after the expiry of legal warranty and comparable obligations, i.e., in principle after 4 years, unless the data is stored in a customer account, e.g., as long as it must be retained for legal archiving reasons (e.g., for tax purposes usually 10 years). We delete data disclosed to us by the contractual partner as part of an order in accordance with the specifications of the order, generally after the end of the order.
Insofar as we use third-party providers or platforms to provide our services, the terms and conditions and data protection notices of the respective third-party providers or platforms apply in the relationship between the users and the providers.
Customer account
Contractual partners can create an account within our online offer (e.g. customer or user account, in short "customer account"). If the registration of a customer account is required, contractual partners will be informed of this as well as of the information required for registration. Customer accounts are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. Within the scope of registration and subsequent logins and uses of the customer account, we store the IP addresses of the customers together with the access times in order to be able to prove the registration and prevent any misuse of the customer account.
If customers have terminated their customer account, the data relating to the customer account will be deleted, unless their retention is required for legal reasons. It is the responsibility of customers to back up their data when the customer account is terminated.

Payment service provider
In the context of contractual and other legal relationships, due to legal obligations or otherwise on the basis of our legitimate interests, we offer data subjects efficient and secure payment options and use other payment service providers in addition to banks and credit institutions for this purpose (collectively, "payment service providers").
The data processed by the payment service providers includes inventory data, such as the name and address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and checksums, as well as the contract, total and recipient-related information. The information is required to carry out the transactions. However, the data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored with them. I.e., we do not receive any account or credit card related information, but only information with confirmation or negative information of the payment. Under certain circumstances, the payment service providers transmit the data to credit agencies. The purpose of this transmission is to check identity and creditworthiness. In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and the data protection notices of the payment service providers.
The terms and conditions and the data protection notices of the respective payment service providers apply to the payment transactions, which can be accessed within the respective websites or transaction applications. We also refer to these for the purpose of further information and assertion of revocation, information and other data subject rights.

Provision of the online offer and web hosting
In order to provide our online offer securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online offer can be accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, as well as security services and technical maintenance services.
The data processed as part of the provision of the hosting offer may include all information relating to the users of our online offer, which is generated as part of the use and communication. This regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary to be able to deliver the contents of online offers to browsers, and all entries made within our online offer or from websites.
Email sending and hosting
The web hosting services we use also include the sending, receiving and storing of e-mails. For these purposes, the addresses of the recipients and senders as well as further information regarding the e-mail dispatch (e.g. the providers involved) and the contents of the respective e-mails are processed. The aforementioned data may also be processed for SPAM detection purposes. Please note that e-mails are generally not sent encrypted on the Internet. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted in transit, but (unless a so-called end-to-end encryption method is used) not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore not assume any responsibility for the transmission path of the e-mails between the sender and the reception on our server.
Collection of access data and log files
We ourselves (or our web hosting provider) collect data on each access to the server (so-called server log files). The server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider.
The server log files may be used, on the one hand, for security purposes, e.g., to prevent server overload (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and, on the other hand, to ensure the utilization of the servers and their stability.
Content Delivery Network
We use a content delivery network (CDN). A CDN is a service with the help of which the content of an online offer, in particular large media files such as graphics or program scripts, can be delivered faster and more securely with the help of regionally distributed servers connected via the Internet.
We use the following hoster:
Siteground
Calle de Serrano 1
28001 Madrid
España
Types of data processed:
Content data (e.g. entries in online forms), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
Affected persons:
Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).
Purposes of processing:
Provision of our online offering and user experience, Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Legal basis:
Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).

Special notes on applications (apps)
We process the data of the users of our application insofar as this is necessary to provide the users with the application and its functionalities, to monitor its security and to develop it further. We may also contact users in compliance with legal requirements, provided that the communication is necessary for purposes of administration or use of the application. In all other respects, we refer to the data protection information in this privacy policy with regard to the processing of users' data.
Legal basis:
The processing of data required for the provision of the functionalities of the application serves the fulfillment of contractual obligations. This also applies if the provision of the functionalities requires an authorization of the users (e.g. releases of device functions). If the processing of data is not necessary for the provision of the functionalities of the application, but serves the security of the application or our business interests (e.g. collection of data for purposes of optimizing the application or security purposes), it is based on our legitimate interests. If users are explicitly asked for their consent to the processing of their data, the processing of the data covered by the consent is based on the consent.

Storage of a universal and unique identifier (UUID)
The application stores a so-called Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the purpose of analyzing the use and functionality of the application as well as storing the user's settings. This identifier is generated during the installation of this application (but is not associated with the device, so it is not a device identifier in this sense), remains stored between the launch of the application and its updates, and is deleted when users remove the application from their device.
Device permissions for access to functions and data
The use of our application or its functionalities may require the user's authorization to access certain functions of the devices used or the data stored on the devices or accessible through the devices. By default, these permissions must be granted by users and can be revoked at any time in the settings of the respective devices. The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may depend on the users' device and software. If clarification is needed, users can contact us. We would like to point out that denial or revocation of the respective permissions may affect the functionality of our app.
Access to the camera and stored recordings
In the context of the use of our application, image and/or video recordings (which also includes audio recordings) of the users (and of other persons covered by the recordings) are processed by accessing the camera functions or stored recordings. Access to the camera functions or stored recordings requires an authorization by the users that can be revoked at any time. The processing of the image and/or video recordings serves in each case only to provide the respective functionality of our application, according to its description to the users, or its typical and expected functionality.
Use of microphone functions
: Within the framework of the use of our application, the microphone functions and audio recordings captured with its help are processed. The use of the microphone functions requires an authorization of the users, which can be revoked at any time. The use of the microphone functions and audio data serves in each case only the provision of the respective functionality of our application, according to its description to the users, or its typical and expected functionality

Users can be informed by e-mail about processes relevant to their user account, such as technical changes.
Registration with pseudonyms
Users are allowed to use pseudonyms as usernames instead of plain names.
Setting the visibility of profiles
Users can use settings to determine the extent to which their profiles are visible to the public or accessible only to certain groups of people.
Deletion of data after termination
If users have terminated their user account, their data with regard to the user account will be deleted, subject to any legal permission, obligation or consent of the users.
It is the responsibility of users to back up their data before the end of the contract in the event of termination. We are entitled to irretrievably delete all user data stored during the term of the contract.

Single sign-on login
Single sign-on" or "single sign-on logon or authentication" refers to procedures that allow users to log on to a provider of single sign-on procedures (e.g., a social network), including our online offering, with the aid of a user account. The prerequisite for single sign-on authentication is that users are registered with the respective single sign-on provider and enter the required access data in the online form provided for this purpose, or are already registered with the single sign-on provider and confirm the single sign-on registration via button.
Authentication takes place directly with the respective single sign-on provider. In the course of such authentication, we receive a user ID with the information that the user is logged in under this user ID at the respective single sign-on provider and an ID that cannot be used by us for other purposes (so-called "user handle"). Whether additional data is transmitted to us depends solely on the single sign-on procedure used, on the data releases selected as part of the authentication process and also on which data users have released in the privacy or other settings of the user account with the single sign-on provider. Depending on the single sign-on provider and the user's choice, this can be different data, usually the e-mail address and the user name. The password entered as part of the single sign-on procedure with the single sign-on provider is neither visible to us nor is it stored by us.
Users are asked to note that their details stored with us may be automatically matched with their user account with the single sign-on provider, but that this is not always possible or actually occurs. If, for example, the users' e-mail addresses change, they must change them manually in their user account with us.
We may use single sign-on login, if agreed with users, as part of or prior to contract performance, where users have been asked to do so, process it as part of consent, and otherwise use it based on the legitimate interests of us and the interests of users in an effective and secure login system.
Should users ever decide that they no longer wish to use the link of their user account with the single sign-on provider for the single sign-on procedure, they must remove this link within their user account with the single sign-on provider. If users wish to delete their data from us, they must cancel their registration with us.

Push messages
With the consent of users, we may send users so-called "push notifications". These are messages that are displayed on users' screens, devices or browsers, even if our online service is not being actively used at the time.
To sign up for the push messages, users must confirm the query of their browser or end device to receive the push messages. This consent process is documented and stored. The storage is necessary to recognize whether users have agreed to receive the push messages and to be able to prove the consent. For these purposes, a pseudonymous identifier of the browser (so-called "push token") or the device ID of an end device is stored.
On the one hand, the push messages may be necessary for the fulfillment of contractual obligations (e.g., technical and organizational information relevant for the use of our online offer) and are otherwise sent on the basis of user consent, unless specifically mentioned below. Users can change the receipt of push messages at any time using the notification settings of their respective browsers or end devices.
Push messages with promotional content
: The push notifications we send may contain promotional information. The promotional push notifications are processed on the basis of users' consent. If, in the context of a consent to receive the promotional push messages, their contents are specifically described, the descriptions are authoritative for the consent of the users. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.
Analysis and performance measurement
We evaluate push messages statistically and can thus recognize if and when push messages were displayed and clicked on. This information is used to technically improve our push messages based on technical data or target groups and their viewing behavior or viewing times. This analysis also includes determining whether push messages are opened, when they are opened, and whether users interact with their content or buttons. While this information can be attributed to individual push message recipients for technical reasons. However, it is neither our intention nor, if used, that of the push message service provider to observe individual users. Rather, the evaluations serve us to recognize the usage habits of our users and to adapt our push messages to them or to send different push messages according to the interests of our users.
The analysis of the push messages and the measurement of success take place on the basis of the express consent of the users, which takes place with the consent to receive the push messages. Users can object to the analysis and performance measurement by unsubscribing from the push messages. A separate revocation of the analysis and performance measurement is unfortunately not possible.
Types of data processed:
Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).
Purposes of processing:
Provision of contractual services and customer service, direct marketing (e.g., by e-mail or postal mail), reach measurement (e.g., access statistics, recognition of returning visitors).

Application procedure
The application process requires applicants to provide us with the data necessary for their assessment and selection. The information required can be found in the job description or, in the case of online forms, in the details provided there.
Basically, the required information includes personal information such as the name, address, a means of contact and proof of the qualifications required for a position. Upon request, we will be happy to provide additional information about which details are required.
If provided, applicants can submit their applications to us using an online form. The data is transmitted to us in encrypted form in accordance with the state of the art. Applicants can also send us their applications by e-mail. Please note, however, that e-mails sent via the Internet are generally not encrypted. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted in transit, but not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore not assume any responsibility for the transmission path of the application between the sender and the reception on our server.
For the purposes of applicant search, submission of applications and selection of applicants, we may use applicant management or recruitment software and platforms and services of third-party providers in compliance with legal requirements.
Applicants are welcome to contact us regarding the method of application submission or to send us the application by mail.
Processing of special categories of data:
Insofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art. 9 (1) DSGVO (e.g. health data, such as severely disabled status or ethnic origin) are requested from applicants in the context of the application process so that the controller or the data subject can exercise the rights accruing to him or her under labor law and social security and social protection law and fulfill his or her obligations in this regard, their processing shall be carried out in accordance with Art. 9 (2) letter b. DSGVO, in case of protection of vital interests of the applicants or other persons according to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. c. DSGVO or for the purposes of preventive health care or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the employee's ability to work, for medical diagnostics, for care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the management of systems and services in the health or social sector pursuant to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h. DSGVO. In the case of notification of the special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their processing is based on Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a. DSGVO.
Deletion of data:
The data provided by applicants may be further processed by us for the purposes of the employment relationship in the event of a successful application. Otherwise, if the application for a job offer is not successful, the applicants' data will be deleted. Applicants' data will also be deleted if an application is withdrawn, which applicants are entitled to do at any time. Subject to a justified withdrawal by the applicants, the deletion will take place at the latest after the expiry of a period of six months so that we can answer any follow-up questions about the application and meet our obligations to provide evidence under the regulations on equal treatment of applicants. Invoices for any reimbursement of travel expenses will be archived in accordance with tax law requirements.
Inclusion in an applicant pool:
Inclusion in an applicant pool, if offered, is based on consent. Applicants are informed that their consent to inclusion in the talent pool is voluntary, has no influence on the current application process and that they can revoke their consent at any time for the future.
Types of data processed:
Applicant data (e.g. personal details, postal and contact addresses, the documents belonging to the application and the information contained therein, such as cover letter, curriculum vitae, certificates, as well as other information provided with regard to a specific position or voluntarily by applicants regarding their person or qualifications).
Affected persons:
Applicants.
Purposes of processing:

Cloud services
We use software services accessible via the Internet and running on the servers of their providers (so-called "cloud services", also referred to as "software as a service") for the following purposes: document storage and management, calendar management, emailing, spreadsheets and presentations, sharing documents, content and information with specific recipients or publishing web pages, forms or other content and information, as well as chats and participation in audio and video conferences.
In this context, personal data may be processed and stored on the servers of the providers, insofar as these are part of communication processes with us or are otherwise processed by us as set out in the context of this privacy policy. This data may include, in particular, master data and contact data of users, data on transactions, contracts, other processes and their contents. The cloud service providers also process usage data and metadata used by them for security purposes and service optimization.
If we use cloud services to provide forms or other documents and content to other users or publicly accessible websites, the providers may store cookies on users' devices for the purposes of web analytics or to remember users' settings (e.g., in the case of media control).
Notes on legal bases:
If we ask for consent to use the cloud services, the legal basis of the processing is consent. Furthermore, their use may be a component of our (pre)contractual services, provided that the use of the cloud services has been agreed within this framework. Otherwise, the users' data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in efficient and secure management and collaboration processes)
Types of data processed:
Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers), content data (e.g. entries in online forms), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).

Newsletter and electronic notifications
We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter "newsletter") only with the consent of the recipients or a legal permission. Insofar as the contents of the newsletter are specifically described in the context of a registration, they are decisive for the consent of the users. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.
To subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide your e-mail address. However, we may ask you to provide a name, for the purpose of personal address in the newsletter, or further information, if this is necessary for the purposes of the newsletter.
Double opt-in procedure:
The registration for our newsletter is always done in a so-called double opt-in process. This means that after registration you will receive an e-mail in which you are asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with other e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Likewise, the changes to your data stored with the shipping service provider are logged.
Deletion and restriction of processing:
We may store unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate interests before deleting them in order to be able to prove consent formerly given. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of consent is confirmed at the same time. In the event of obligations to permanently observe objections, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address in a block list (so-called "block list") for this purpose alone.
The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving its proper course. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.
Notes on legal bases:
The newsletter is sent on the basis of the recipients' consent or, if consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate interests in direct marketing, if and to the extent that this is permitted by law, e.g. in the case of existing customer advertising. Insofar as we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests. The registration process is recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests to prove that it was carried out in accordance with the law.
Contents: Information about us, our services, promotions and offers.
Measurement of open and click rates
The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened, or, if we use a shipping service provider, from their server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of the retrieval, are initially collected.
This information is used to technically improve our newsletter based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. This analysis also includes determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. This information is assigned to the individual newsletter recipients and stored in their profiles until they are deleted. We use the analyses to identify the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.
The measurement of opening rates and click-through rates as well as the storage of the measurement results in the users' profiles and their further processing are based on the users' consent.
A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled, or it must be contradicted. In this case, the stored profile information will be deleted.
Types of data processed:
Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).
Affected persons:
Communication partner.

Possibility of objection (opt-out):
You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent or object to further receipt. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter either at the end of each newsletter or you can otherwise use one of the above contact options, preferably e-mail, for this purpose.

Sweepstakes and contests
We process personal data of participants in sweepstakes and contests only in compliance with the relevant data protection provisions, insofar as the processing is contractually necessary for the provision, implementation and execution of the sweepstakes, the participants have consented to the processing or the processing serves our legitimate interests (e.g., in the security of the sweepstakes or the protection of our interests against misuse through possible collection of IP addresses when submitting sweepstakes entries).
If contributions from participants are published as part of the sweepstakes (e.g. as part of a vote or presentation of the sweepstakes entries or the winners or reporting on the sweepstakes), we would like to point out that the names of the participants may also be published in this context. The participants can object to this at any time.
If the sweepstakes takes place within an online platform or a social network (e.g. Facebook or Instagram, hereinafter referred to as "online platform"), the usage and data protection provisions of the respective platforms shall also apply. In these cases, we would like to point out that we are responsible for the information provided by the participants as part of the sweepstakes and that inquiries with regard to the sweepstakes should be directed to us.
The participants' data will be deleted as soon as the competition or contest has ended and the data is no longer required to inform the winners or because queries about the competition are to be expected. In principle, the participants' data will be deleted no later than 6 months after the end of the sweepstakes. Winners' data may be retained for longer in order, for example, to answer queries about the prizes or to be able to fulfill the prize services; in this case, the retention period depends on the type of prize and is up to three years for items or services, for example, in order to be able to process warranty claims. Furthermore, the participants' data may be stored for longer, e.g. in the form of reporting on the prize draw in online and offline media.
If data was also collected for other purposes within the scope of the competition, its processing and the retention period will be governed by the data protection information on this use (e.g. in the case of registration for the newsletter as part of a competition).

Web analysis, monitoring and optimization
Web analytics (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to our online offering and may include behavior, interests or demographic information about visitors, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of reach analysis, we can recognize, for example, at what time our online offer or its functions or content are most frequently used or invite re-use. Likewise, we can understand which areas require optimization.
In addition to web analytics, we may also use testing procedures, for example, to test and optimize different versions of our online offering or its components.
For these purposes, so-called user profiles may be created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedures may be used with the same purpose. This information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited and elements used there, and technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used, and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this may also be processed, depending on the provider.
The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use an IP masking procedure (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. Generally, in the context of web analysis, A/B testing and optimization, no clear data of the users (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of the software used, do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.
Notes on legal bases:
If we ask users for their consent to use the third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, the users' data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to refer you to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.
Types of data processed:
Usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
Affected persons:
Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).
Purposes of processing:
Reach measurement (e.g. access statistics, recognition of returning visitors), profiles with user-related information (creation of user profiles).
Safety measures:
IP masking (pseudonymization of the IP address).

Online marketing
We process personal data for online marketing purposes, which may include, in particular, marketing advertising space or displaying promotional and other content (collectively, "Content") based on users' potential interests and measuring its effectiveness.
For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedures are used, by means of which the information about the user relevant for the presentation of the aforementioned content is stored. This information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, but also communication partners and technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this may also be processed.
The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use available IP masking procedures (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is stored as part of the online marketing process, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of the online marketing procedures, do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles.
The information in the profiles is usually stored in the cookies or by means of similar procedures. These cookies can later generally also be read on other websites that use the same online marketing procedure and analyzed for the purpose of displaying content as well as supplemented with further data and stored on the server of the online marketing procedure provider.
Exceptionally, clear data may be associated with the profiles. This is the case if, for example, the users are members of a social network whose online marketing procedures we use and the network links the users' profiles with the aforementioned data. We ask that you note that users can make additional agreements with the providers, e.g., by giving their consent as part of the registration process.
In principle, we only receive access to summarized information about the success of our advertisements. However, in the context of so-called conversion measurements, we can check which of our online marketing methods have led to a so-called conversion, i.e., for example, to a contract being concluded with us. The conversion measurement is used solely to analyze the success of our marketing measures.
Unless otherwise stated, we ask you to assume that cookies used will be stored for a period of two years.
Notes on legal bases:
If we ask users for their consent to use the third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, the users' data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to refer you to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.
Facebook pixel and targeting (Custom Audiences)
With the help of the Facebook pixel (or comparable functions, for the transmission of event data or contact information by means of interfaces in apps), it is possible for Facebook to determine the visitors to our online offer as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called "Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel in order to display the Facebook ads placed by us only to such users on Facebook and within the services of the partners cooperating with Facebook (so-called "Audience Network".
https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/
) who have also shown an interest in our online offer or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interest in certain topics or products that are evident from the web pages visited) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called "Custom Audiences"). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of users and do not have a harassing effect. Furthermore, with the help of the Facebook pixel, we can track the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion measurement").
We are jointly responsible with Facebook Ireland Ltd. for collecting or receiving in the course of a transmission (but not further processing) "Event Data" that Facebook collects or receives in the course of a transmission by means of the Facebook Pixel and similar features (e.g., interfaces) running on our Online Offer for the purposes of: a) displaying content advertising information that matches users' presumed interests; b) delivering commercial and transactional messages (e.g., targeting users via Facebook Messenger); c) improving ad delivery and personalizing features and content (e.g., improving identification of which content or advertising information is presumed to be of interest to users); d) improving the quality of content and personalization of features and content (e.g., improving identification of which content or advertising information is presumed to be of interest to users). e.g., targeting users via Facebook Messenger); c) improving ad delivery and personalization of features and content (e.g., improving the detection of which content or advertising information presumably matches users' interests). We have entered into a specific agreement with Facebook ("Responsible Party Addendum,
https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum
), which regulates in particular which security measures Facebook must observe (
https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/data_security_terms
) and in which Facebook has agreed to comply with data subjects' rights (i.e., users can, for example, provide information or make deletion requests directly to Facebook). Note: If Facebook provides us with metrics, analytics, and reports (which are aggregated, i.e., do not receive information about individual users and are anonymous to us), then this processing is not done under shared responsibility, but rather on the basis of a commissioned processing agreement ("Data Processing Terms ",
https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/dataprocessing
) , the "Data security conditions" (
https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/data_security_terms
) as well as with regard to processing in the U.S. based on standard contractual clauses ("Facebook EU Data Transfer Addendum,
https://www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum).Die
Users' rights (in particular to information, deletion, objection and complaint to the competent supervisory authority) are not restricted by the agreements with Facebook.
Types of data processed:
Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), event data (Facebook) ("event data" is data that can be transmitted by us to Facebook, e.g. via Facebook Pixel (via apps or in other ways), and relates to individuals or their actions; the data includes e.g.. Information about visits to websites, interactions with content, functions, installations of apps, purchases of products, etc.; Event data is processed for the purpose of forming target groups for content and advertising information (Custom Audiences); Event data does not include the actual content (such as written comments), no login information and no contact information (i.e. no names, email addresses and phone numbers). Event data is deleted by Facebook after a maximum of two years, the target groups formed from them with the deletion of our Facebook account).

Affiliate programs and affiliate links
We include so-called affiliate links or other references (which may include, for example, search masks, widgets or discount codes) to the offers and services of third-party providers in our online offer (collectively referred to as "affiliate links"). If users follow the Affiliate Links or subsequently take advantage of the offers, we may receive a commission or other benefits from those third parties (collectively, "Commission").
In order to be able to track whether users have taken advantage of the offers of an affiliate link used by us, it is necessary that the respective third-party providers learn that users have followed an affiliate link used within our online offer. The assignment of the affiliate links to the respective business transactions or to other actions (e.g. purchases) serves the sole purpose of commission accounting and will be cancelled as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose.
For the purposes of the aforementioned assignment of the affiliate links, the affiliate links can be supplemented by certain values that are a component of the link or can be stored otherwise, e.g. in a cookie. The values may include, in particular, the source website (referrer), the time, an online identifier of the operator of the website on which the affiliate link was located, an online identifier of the respective offer, the type of link used, the type of offer and an online identifier of the user.
Notes on legal bases:
If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal basis for the processing of data is consent. Furthermore, their use may be a component of our (pre)contractual services, provided that the use of the third-party providers has been agreed within this framework.

Rating platforms
We participate in rating procedures in order to evaluate, optimize and promote our services. If users rate us or otherwise provide feedback via the participating rating platforms or procedures, the General Terms and Conditions of Business or Use and the privacy notices of the providers also apply. As a rule, the evaluation also requires registration with the respective providers.
In order to ensure that the persons rating have actually used our services, we transmit, with the consent of the customers, the data required for this with regard to the customer and the service used to the respective rating platform (including name, e-mail address and order number or item number). This data is used solely to verify the authenticity of the user.
Rating widget
We integrate so-called "rating widgets" into our online offer. A widget is a functional and content element integrated into our online offer that displays variable information. It can be displayed, for example, in the form of a seal or comparable element, sometimes also called a "badge". In this case, the corresponding content of the widget is displayed within our online offer, but it is retrieved at that moment from the servers of the respective widget provider. This is the only way to always show the current content, especially the current rating. For this purpose, a data connection must be established from the website called up within our online offer to the server of the widget provider and the widget provider receives certain technical data (access data, including IP address), which are necessary so that the content of the widget can be delivered to the user's browser.
Furthermore, the widget provider receives information that users have visited our online offer. This information can be stored in a cookie and used by the widget provider to recognize which online offers that participate in the evaluation process have been visited by the user. The information may be stored in a user profile and used for advertising or market research purposes.

Use of the OpenAI API
We use the services of OpenAI, including the OpenAI API, for various purposes within our Hundeo app to improve interactions and personalized recommendations. The OpenAI API enables us to respond to user requests with automated but precisely tailored responses, optimize interaction experiences and continuously improve the usability of our app.
Processed data
By using the OpenAI API, personal data may be processed and temporarily stored insofar as this is necessary to respond to user queries or to provide personalized content. This includes, in particular, text entries or other information that users enter or provide within the app. OpenAI also processes usage data and metadata for security purposes and to optimize its service.
Purposes and legal bases of processing
The OpenAI API is used for the purpose of improving our app services and optimizing the user experience. If we ask for consent to use the OpenAI API, the legal basis for processing is consent. Otherwise, processing is based on our legitimate interest in efficient, interactive and user-friendly app services.
Notes on legal bases
The processing of data in the context of the OpenAI API is based on consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR), in the context of the provision of our contractual services (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR) or on the basis of our legitimate interests in the improvement and personalization of our services (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR).

Use of OneSignal for emails and push notifications
In order to improve our communication with you, the users of the Hundeo app, and to provide you with timely updates, personalized offers and important information, we use OneSignal, a service for sending emails and push notifications.
Processed data
By using OneSignal, personal data such as email addresses, device IDs and usage data (e.g. time of receipt of a message and interaction with it) may be processed. This data allows us to personalize and optimize communication with you by ensuring that you receive relevant and timely information.
Purposes and legal bases of processing
The integration of OneSignal serves to increase the efficiency of our communication strategies and to implement a targeted notification system within our app. The processing of your data is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR) or, if the communication is necessary for the provision of our contractual services, on the legal basis of contract fulfillment (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR).

Presence in social networks (social media)
We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with users active there or to offer information about us.
We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for the users because, for example, the enforcement of the users' rights could be made more difficult.
Furthermore, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created based on the usage behavior and resulting interests of the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behavior and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data independent of the devices used by the users may also be stored in the usage profiles (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).
For a detailed presentation of the respective forms of processing and the options to object (opt-out), we refer to the privacy statements and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.
In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would also like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the users' data and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.

Plugins and embedded functions and content
We integrate functional and content elements into our online offer that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These can be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").
The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is thus required for the display of this content or function. We strive to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to analyze information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our online offer as well as be linked to such information from other sources.
Notes on legal bases:
If we ask users for their consent to use the third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, the users' data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to refer you to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.
Facebook plugins and content
We are jointly responsible with Facebook Ireland Ltd. for the collection or receipt in connection with a transmission (but not the further processing) of "Event Data" that Facebook collects or receives in connection with a transmission through the Facebook social plugins (and content embedding features) that run on our Online Services for the purposes of: a) displaying content and advertising information that is relevant to users' perceived interests; b) delivering commercial and transactional messages (e.g., targeting users via Facebook Messenger); c) improving ad delivery and personalizing features and content (e.g., improving the identification of which content or advertising information is relevant to users' perceived interests). e.g., targeting users via Facebook Messenger); c) improving ad delivery and personalization of features and content (e.g., improving the detection of which content or advertising information presumably matches users' interests). We have entered into a specific agreement with Facebook ("Responsible Party Addendum,
https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum
), which regulates in particular which security measures Facebook must observe (
https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/data_security_terms
) and in which Facebook has agreed to comply with data subjects' rights (i.e., users can, for example, provide information or make deletion requests directly to Facebook). Note: If Facebook provides us with metrics, analytics, and reports (which are aggregated, i.e., do not receive information about individual users and are anonymous to us), then this processing is not done under shared responsibility, but rather on the basis of a commissioned processing agreement ("Data Processing Terms ",
https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/dataprocessing
) , the "Data security conditions" (
https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/data_security_terms
) as well as with regard to processing in the U.S. based on standard contractual clauses ("Facebook EU Data Transfer Addendum,

Management, organization and auxiliary tools
We use services, platforms and software from other providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers") for the purposes of organizing, managing, planning and providing our services. When selecting third-party providers and their services, we observe the legal requirements.
In this context, personal data may be processed and stored on the servers of the third-party providers. This may involve various data that we process in accordance with this privacy policy. This data may include, in particular, master data and contact data of users, data on transactions, contracts, other processes and their contents.
If users are referred to third-party providers or their software or platforms in the course of communication, business or other relationships with us, the third-party providers may process usage data and metadata for security purposes, service optimization or marketing purposes. We therefore ask you to observe the data protection notices of the respective third-party providers.
Notes on legal bases:
If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal basis for the processing of data is consent. Furthermore, their use may be a component of our (pre)contractual services, provided that the use of the third-party providers has been agreed within this framework. Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services).

Data deletion
The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not required for the purpose).
If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing is limited to these purposes. I.e., the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.
As part of our privacy notices, we may provide users with additional information regarding the deletion as well as the retention of data that is specific to each processing operation.
Modification and update of the privacy policy
We ask you to regularly inform yourself about the content of our privacy policy. We adapt the data protection declaration as soon as the changes in the data processing carried out by us make this necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require an act of cooperation on your part (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.
Where we provide addresses and contact information of companies and organizations in this privacy statement, please note that the addresses may change over time and please check the information before contacting us.
Rights of the data subjects
As a data subject, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:
Right to object: You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purposes of such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.
Right of withdrawal for consents:
You have the right to revoke any consent you have given at any time.
Right to Information:
You have the right to request confirmation as to whether data in question is being processed and to information about this data, as well as further information and a copy of the data in accordance with the legal requirements.
Right of rectification:
In accordance with the legal requirements, you have the right to request that the data concerning you be completed or that incorrect data concerning you be corrected.
Right to erasure and restriction of processing:
In accordance with the statutory provisions, you have the right to demand that data relating to you be deleted immediately, or alternatively, in accordance with the statutory provisions, to demand restriction of the processing of the data.
Right to data portability:
You have the right to receive data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, common and machine-readable format in accordance with the legal requirements, or to request that it be transferred to another responsible party.
Complaint to supervisory authority:
In accordance with the law and without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority, in particular a supervisory authority in the Member State where you usually reside, the supervisory authority of your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR.
Definitions
This section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are taken from the law and defined primarily in Art. 4 of the GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily intended to aid understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.
Affiliate tracking:
As part of affiliate tracking, links are logged with the help of which the linking websites refer users to websites with product or other offers. The operators of the respective linking websites may receive a commission if users follow these so-called affiliate links and subsequently take advantage of the offers (e.g. buy goods or use services). For this purpose, it is necessary for the providers to be able to track whether users who are interested in certain offers subsequently take advantage of them at the instigation of the affiliate links. It is therefore necessary for the functionality of affiliate links that they are supplemented with certain values that become part of the link or are stored elsewhere, e.g. in a cookie. The values include, in particular, the source website (referrer), the time, an online identifier of the operator of the website on which the affiliate link was located, an online identifier of the respective offer, an online identifier of the user as well as tracking-specific values, such as, for example, advertising material ID, affiliate ID and categorizations.
Content Delivery Network (CDN):
A "Content Delivery Network" (CDN) is a service with the help of which the content of an online offer, in particular large media files such as graphics or program scripts, can be delivered faster and more securely with the help of regionally distributed servers connected via the Internet.
IP Masking:
IP masking" refers to a method in which the last octet, i.e., the last two numbers of an IP address, is deleted so that the IP address can no longer be used to uniquely identify a person. Therefore, IP masking is a means of pseudonymizing processing procedures, especially in online marketing
Conversion measurement:
Conversion measurement (also referred to as "visit action evaluation") is a method used to determine the effectiveness of marketing measures. For this purpose, a cookie is usually stored on the users' devices within the websites on which the marketing measures take place and then retrieved again on the target website. For example, this allows us to track whether the ads we have placed on other websites have been successful.
Personal data:
"Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. cookie) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
Profiles with user-related information:
The processing of "profiles with user-related information", or "profiles" for short, includes any type of automated processing of personal data that consists of using this personal data to analyze, evaluate or predict certain personal aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, this may include different information concerning demographics, behavior and interests, such as interaction with websites and their content, etc.) (e.g. interests in certain content or products, click behavior on a website or location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for profiling purposes.
Reach measurement:
Reach measurement (also known as web analytics) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to an online offering and can include visitors' behavior or interests in certain information, such as website content. With the help of reach analysis, website owners can see, for example, at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This enables them, for example, to better adapt the content of the website to the needs of their visitors. For the purposes of reach analysis, pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are often used to recognize returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an online offer.
Remarketing:
We speak of "remarketing" or "retargeting" when, for example, it is noted for advertising purposes which products a user was interested in on a website in order to remind the user of these products on other websites, e.g. in advertisements.
Person responsible:
Controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
Processing:
"Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means. The term is broad and includes virtually any handling of data, be it collection, analysis, storage, transmission or deletion.
Target group formation:
We speak of target group formation (or "custom audiences") when target groups are determined for advertising purposes, e.g., insertion of advertisements. For example, based on a user's interest in certain products or topics on the Internet, it can be concluded that this user is interested in advertisements for similar products or the online store in which he viewed the products. In turn, we speak of "lookalike audiences" (or similar target groups) when the content deemed suitable is displayed to users whose profiles or interests presumably correspond to the users for whom the profiles were formed. Cookies and web beacons are generally used for the purpose of creating Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences.

3 – General information on data processing
1 – Scope of personal data processing
We only collect and use the personal data of our users insofar as this is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our contents and services. The collection and use of the personal data of our users regularly takes place only with the consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for practical reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.
2 – Legal basis for the processing of personal data
Insofar as we obtain your consent for the processing of personal data, point (a) of Article 6 (1) of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
Point (b) of Article 6 (1) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract to which you are a party. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
Point (c) of Article 6 (1) GDPR serves as the legal basis insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.
If processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, and your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms do not override the former interest, point (f) of Article 6 (1) serves as the legal basis for processing.
3 – Data erasure and storage period
Personal data concerning you shall be erased or blocked as soon as the purchase of storage ceases to apply. Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject. The data shall also be blocked or erased if a storage period required by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further data storage for the conclusion or performance of a contract.
4 – Provision of website and creation of log files
1 – Description and scope of data processing
Every time you visit our web page, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the visiting computer.
The following data is collected here:
Information about the browser type and version used
The operating system of the user
The internet service provider of the user
The IP address of the user
Date and time of access
Websites from which the system of the user reaches our web page
This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.
2 – Legal basis for data processing
The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is point (f) of Article 6 (1) GDPR.
3 – Purpose of data processing
The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be delivered to the computer of the user. For this to happen, the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.
The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not happen in this context.
Our legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to point (f) of Article 6 (1) GDPR also lies in these purposes.
4 – Duration of storage
The data shall be erased as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purchase for which it was collected.
Storage of data in the log files: The IP address and the HTTP user agent are stored in plain text in the web server log files for a maximum of 6 weeks to detect and analyze attacks on our website.
Storage of data in our database: An anonymous storage as hash is carried out in our database for 7 days in order to be able to assign and pay out the sales commission to our affiliates.
5 – Possibility of objection and disposal
The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. You therefore have no possibility of objection.
5 – Use of cookies

If the restriction of the processing is carried out pursuant to the conditions mentioned above, we shall inform you before the restriction is lifted.
4 – Right to erasure

Exemptions
The right to be forgotten does not exist insofar as the processing is necessary
to exercise the freedom of expression and information;
to fulfill a legal obligation required for processing under the law of the Union or of the Member States to which we are subject or to perform a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority conferred on us;
for reasons of public interest in the area of public health pursuant to points (h) and (i) of Article 9 (2) and Article 9 (3) GDPR;
for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 (1) GDPR insofar as the law referred to under a) is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the attainment of the objectives of such processing, or

5 – Right to information
If you have exercised your right to rectification, erasure or restriction, we are obligated to inform all recipients to whom personal data concerning you has been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or would give rise to disproportionate difficulties.
You have the right to be informed of these recipients.
6 – Right to data portability
You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided, where:
the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6 (1) or point (a) of Article 9 (2) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6 (1) GDPR and
the processing is carried out by automated means.
In exercising this right, you shall also have the right to request that the personal data concerning you be transferred directly from one data controller to another data controller, insofar as this is technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons shall not be affected by this.
7 – Right to object
You shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on points (e) or (f) of Article 6 (1), including profiling based on these provisions.
We shall no longer process personal data relating to you unless we can provide compelling grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Where the personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.

10 – Google
1 - Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics on our website, an analysis service of the US company Google Inc. ("Google"), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, U.S.A. Google Analytics uses "cookies", small text files that are stored on your computer. These cookies are used to analyze your use of our website. The corresponding data about your user behavior is forwarded to a Google server in the USA where it is evaluated and stored.
If IP anonymization is activated on this website within the member states of the European Union and the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Google will shorten your IP address for the purposes of anonymization. Only in exceptional cases shall there be an uncut transmission to the USA with shortening of the IP address on a server there.
Google shall use this information at the initiative of the owner of this website to evaluate how you use the website. In addition, Google shall use this information to produce reports on website activity and provide other services in connection with the use of the website and the internet for its operators. Google does not amalgamate the IP address transmitted by your browser through the use of Google Analytics with other Google data.
You can prevent the storage of cookies yourself by adjusting an appropriate setting in your browser. However, in this case you may not be able to fully use all the website functions. You can prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie (including your IP address) about your use of the website and the processing of this data by Google. All you need to do is to download and install an additional browser plugin. You can download this plugin using the following link:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
2 - Google Maps
We use Google Maps (API) provided by the software company Google Inc. The responsible party for the European area is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Maps is an interactive map service that visualizes geographical data and identifies and processes location data. We use Google Maps to support our customers with filling in address fields. We use Google Maps based on your consent within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR. When you use Google Maps, your personal data is processed and stored. This includes:
Search terms entered
Location data
Your IP address
Usage/metadata
The integration into our website means that cookies are also set, which are used to collect data relating to your user behavior. Google does not clearly communicate whether, where, and for how long this data is stored by Google. However, since Google operates a large part of its servers in the USA, it is safe to assume that the above-mentioned data is also processed and stored there. A list of Google data centers can be found here
https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en
. We have no influence on the storage location of the above-mentioned data. We would like to point out that the European Court of Justice believes that there is not currently an adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA. This may be accompanied by various risks to the legality and security of data processing. Google uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission (Article 46 (2) and (3) of the GDPR) as the basis for data processing for recipients located in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) or for data transfers there. These clauses oblige Google to comply with the EU level of data protection when processing relevant data outside the EU. In turn, these clauses are based on an implementation decision made by the EU Commission. If you do not want cookies in general, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can then decide for each individual cookie whether to allow it or not. You can find further information at

3 - DoubleClick
We use the Google Marketing Platform (formerly known as “Google DoubleClick”) provided by the software company Google Inc. The responsible party for the European area is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland. This service sets cookies to display relevant ads and to optimize reports and analysis of campaign performance. Google records which ads have already been displayed in the user's browser, thereby preventing multiple displays. Google can also use the cookies to determine whether a user accesses the advertiser's website and purchases a product after an ad has been displayed. According to Google, the cookies used do not contain any personal data. However, your browser also establishes a direct connection with one or more Google servers. This involves the processing of your personal data. This includes:
The accessed website/the accessed website area
Your IP address

This data shall be used exclusively on the basis of your consent within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR and Section 5 of S.I.

14 – Disclosure of data to payment service providers
As part of contractual relationships, we offer data subjects efficient and secure payment options. In addition to banks and credit institutions, we also use other service providers for this purpose (collectively “payment service providers”) (Art. 6 (1) p.1 lit b GDPR).
The data processed by the payment service providers includes inventory data, e.g. name and address, bank data such as account numbers, credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and checksums as well as contractual, recipient or sum-related data. The data is required in order to carry out the transactions. However, the data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. In other words, we don’t receive any account or credit card-related data, but rather only information with confirmation or denial of payment. Under certain circumstances, the payment service providers transmit data to credit agencies for the purpose of verifying identity and creditworthiness. In this regard, we would refer you to the terms and conditions and the privacy notice of the respective payment service providers.
The terms and conditions and privacy notice of the respective payment service providers, which can be accessed on the respective websites or transaction applications, shall apply to the payment transactions.
The types of data processed by payment service providers include inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history); contractual data (e.g. subject matter of contract, term, customer category); usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times) and meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses)

Wir bei Apple glauben fest daran, dass Datenschutz ein Grundrecht ist – und dass dieses Grundrecht nicht davon abhängen sollte, wo auf der Welt Sie leben.
Aus diesem Grund behandeln wir alle Daten, die sich auf eine identifizierte oder identifizierbare Person beziehen oder die von Apple mit dieser Person verknüpft oder verknüpfbar sind, als „personenbezogene Daten“, unabhängig davon, wo die Person lebt.
Das bedeutet, dass sowohl Daten, die Sie direkt identifizieren – z. B. Ihr Name – als auch Daten, die Sie nicht direkt identifizieren, die aber zu Ihrer Identifizierung verwendet werden können – z. B. die Seriennummer Ihres Geräts –, personenbezogene Daten sind. Aggregierte Daten gelten im Sinne dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie als nicht personenbezogene Daten.
Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie beschreibt, wie
Apple oder ein Apple Partnerunternehmen
(gemeinsam „Apple“) mit personenbezogenen Daten umgeht, unabhängig davon, ob Sie mit uns auf unseren Websites, über Apple Apps (wie Apple Music oder Wallet) oder persönlich (auch telefonisch oder beim Besuch eines Apple Stores) interagieren. Apple kann auch Links zu Drittanbietern auf unseren Diensten oder Apps von Drittanbietern zum Download in unserem App Store zur Verfügung stellen. Die Apple Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt nicht dafür, wie Drittanbieter personenbezogene Daten definieren oder verwenden. Wir empfehlen Ihnen, die Datenschutzrichtlinien von Drittanbietern zu lesen und sich mit Ihren Datenschutzrechten vertraut zu machen, bevor Sie mit ihnen interagieren.
Wir bei Apple geben Ihnen die Möglichkeit, Auskunft über Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu erhalten, auf sie zuzugreifen, sie zu korrigieren, zu übertragen, ihre Verarbeitung einzuschränken und sie zu löschen. Wir gewähren diese Rechte unserem weltweiten Kundenstamm, und wenn Sie sich entscheiden, diese Datenschutzrechte auszuüben, haben Sie das Recht, weder diskriminierend behandelt zu werden noch einen minderwertigen Dienst von Apple zu erhalten. Wenn Sie aufgefordert werden, der Bearbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch Apple zuzustimmen, haben Sie auch das Recht, Ihre Zustimmung jederzeit zu widerrufen.
Um Ihre Rechte und Wahlmöglichkeiten in Bezug auf den Datenschutz wahrzunehmen, einschließlich der Fälle, in denen ein Drittanbieter im Namen von Apple handelt, besuchen Sie die Apple Daten- und Datenschutzseite unter
privacy.apple.com
für Apple oder
shazam.com/privacy
für Shazam.
Um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen, müssen Sie sich bei Ihrem Account anmelden, und Ihre Identität wird überprüft. Wenn Sie eine Kopie Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten wünschen, die derzeit nicht unter
privacy.apple.com
verfügbar ist, können Sie diese unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
anfordern. Sie haben auch das Recht, eine Beschwerde bei der zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörde einzureichen.
Es kann Situationen geben, in denen wir Ihrer Bitte nicht nachkommen können – zum Beispiel wenn Sie uns bitten, Ihre Transaktionsdaten zu löschen, Apple aber gesetzlich verpflichtet ist, diese Transaktion aufzuzeichnen. Wir können einen Antrag auch ablehnen, wenn dies unsere rechtmäßige Verwendung der Daten zur Betrugsbekämpfung und zu Sicherheitszwecken untergraben würde, etwa wenn Sie die Löschung eines Accounts beantragen, der wegen Sicherheitsbedenken untersucht wird. Ihre Datenschutzanfrage kann ferner abgelehnt werden, wenn sie die Privatsphäre anderer gefährdet, leichtfertig oder schikanös ist oder äußerst unpraktisch oder unangemessen wäre.
Wenn Sie in Kalifornien leben und keinen Zugriff auf die Apple Seite für Daten und Datenschutz haben
, können Sie oder Ihr Bevollmächtigter unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
oder telefonisch unter +1 800 275 2273 einen Antrag stellen.
Weitere Informationen über die Geltendmachung Ihrer Rechte finden Sie unter
support.apple.com/102283
.
Wir bei Apple sind davon überzeugt, dass wir Ihnen großartige Produkte und einen hohen Datenschutz bieten können. Dies bedeutet, dass wir bemüht sind,
nur die personenbezogenen Daten zu erfassen, die wir benötigen
. Welche personenbezogenen Daten Apple erfasst, hängt davon ab, wie Sie mit Apple interagieren. Erläuterungen zum Umgang von Apple mit personenbezogenen Daten für bestimmte einzelne Dienste finden Sie unter
apple.com/de/legal/privacy/data.
Wenn Sie einen Apple Account erstellen, einen Kredit beantragen, ein Produkt oder Gerät kaufen und/oder aktivieren, ein Softwareupdate laden, sich für einen Kurs in einem Apple Store anmelden, sich mit unseren Diensten verbinden, uns kontaktieren (auch über soziale Medien), an einer Online-Umfrage teilnehmen oder anderweitig mit Apple interagieren, können wir eine Vielzahl von Informationen erfassen, darunter:

Daten, die sich auf den Gesundheitszustand einer Person beziehen, einschließlich Daten, die sich auf die physische oder psychische Gesundheit einer Person beziehen. Zu den personenbezogenen Gesundheitsdaten gehören auch Daten, die verwendet werden können, um Rückschlüsse auf den Gesundheitszustand einer Person zu ziehen oder diesen festzustellen. Wenn Sie mit einer App der Apple Health Research Study an einer Studie teilnehmen, ist die Richtlinie zum Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten unter
Apple Health Study Apps – Datenschutzrichtlinie
beschrieben.

Sonstige Informationen, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen.
Details wie der Inhalt Ihrer Kommunikation mit Apple, einschließlich Interaktionen mit dem Kundensupport und Kontakten über Social-Media-Kanäle
Sie sind nicht verpflichtet, die von uns angeforderten personenbezogenen Daten zur Verfügung zu stellen. Wenn Sie sich jedoch dagegen entscheiden, werden wir in vielen Fällen nicht in der Lage sein, Ihnen unsere Produkte oder Dienste zur Verfügung zu stellen oder auf Ihre Anfragen zu reagieren.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten über Sie von anderen
Einzelpersonen
, von Unternehmen oder Dritten, die
in Ihrem Auftrag
handeln, von unseren
Partnern, die mit uns zusammenarbeiten, um unsere Produkte und Dienste bereitzustellen und uns bei der Sicherheit und Betrugsbekämpfung zu unterstützen, sowie von anderen
rechtmäßigen Quellen erhalten.
Einzelpersonen.
Apple kann Daten über Sie von anderen Einzelpersonen erfassen – zum Beispiel, wenn diese Person Ihnen ein Produkt oder eine Geschenkkarte geschickt, Sie zur Teilnahme an einem Apple Dienst oder Forum eingeladen oder Inhalte mit Ihnen geteilt hat.
In Ihrem Auftrag.
Sie können andere Einzelpersonen oder Dritte beauftragen, Daten an Apple weiterzugeben. Beispielsweise können Sie Ihren Mobilfunkanbieter beauftragen, Daten über Ihren Anbieter-Account zur Accountaktivierung an Apple weiterzugeben oder Informationen über Ihre Teilnahme an einem Treueprogramm weiterzugeben, damit Sie Prämien für Apple Käufe sammeln können.
Apple Partner.
Im Sinne der Sicherheit und der Betrugsbekämpfung können wir die von Ihnen bereitgestellten Informationen durch Dritte überprüfen lassen, z. B. wenn ein Apple Account erstellt wird.
Um Features wie die Suchfunktion zu verbessern und zur Erstellung von Grundlagenmodellen für KI-Funktionen verwendet Apple den Webcrawler Applebot, um Informationen zu durchforsten, die im Internet öffentlich zugänglich sind. Wir haben verschiedene Maßnahmen getroffen, um die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir erheben, zu reduzieren. Apple versucht nicht, einzelne Apple Nutzer anhand der durchsuchten Daten zu identifizieren oder Profile über Einzelpersonen zu erstellen. Wir verwenden keine privaten persönlichen Daten zum Trainieren unserer KI-Grundlagenmodelle. Wenn du dein Widerspruchsrecht in Bezug auf Verarbeitung von Informationen in Anspruch nehmen möchtest, verwende das
Formular für Anfragen zum Datenschutz von Apple Intelligence
. Weitere Informationen zum Applebot findest du auf der Seite

Für Zwecke der Forschung und Entwicklung können wir Datensätze heranziehen, die Bilder oder Sprachaufzeichnungen oder andere Daten, die Rückschlüsse auf eine identifizierbare Person zulassen, enthalten. Die Erhebung solcher Datensätze erfolgt unter Einhaltung des geltenden Rechts, einschließlich des Rechts in der Jurisdiktion, in welcher der jeweilige Datensatz gehostet wird. Bei der Verwendung solcher Datensätze für Forschungs- und Entwicklungszwecke unternehmen wir keinerlei Versuche, die in diesem Material ggf. vorkommenden Personen zu identifizieren.
Apple verwendet personenbezogene Daten, um unsere Dienste bereitzustellen, Ihre Transaktionen zu verarbeiten, mit Ihnen zu kommunizieren, zur Sicherheit und Betrugsbekämpfung sowie zur Einhaltung von Gesetzen. Mit Ihrer Zustimmung können wir personenbezogene Daten auch für andere Zwecke verwenden.
Apple verwendet Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur dann, wenn wir eine gültige gesetzliche Grundlage dafür haben.
Je nach den Umständen kann sich Apple auf Ihre Einwilligung oder die Tatsache verlassen, dass die Verarbeitung erforderlich ist, um einen Vertrag mit Ihnen zu erfüllen, Ihre lebenswichtigen Interessen oder die anderer Personen zu schützen oder Gesetze einzuhalten. Unter Berücksichtigung Ihrer Interessen, Rechte und Erwartungen können wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auch verarbeiten, wenn wir der Meinung sind, dass dies in unserem oder dem berechtigten Interesse anderer liegt. Weitere Informationen sind in den produktspezifischen Informationen unserer Produkte und Features wie oben beschrieben eingebettet. Wenn Sie Fragen zur Rechtsgrundlage haben, können Sie sich unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
an den Datenschutzbeauftragten wenden.
Bereitstellung unserer Dienste.
Apple erfasst personenbezogene Daten, die zur Bereitstellung unserer Dienste erforderlich sind. Dazu können personenbezogene Daten gehören, die zur Verbesserung unserer Angebote, für interne Zwecke wie Prüfungen oder Datenanalysen oder zur Problembehebung erfasst werden. Wenn Sie beispielsweise über ein Apple Music Abonnement auf einen Song zugreifen möchten, erfassen wir Daten darüber, welche Songs Sie abspielen, um Ihnen die angeforderten Inhalte zur Verfügung zu stellen, sowie aus Lizenzgründen.
Verarbeitung Ihrer Transaktionen.
Um Transaktionen zu verarbeiten, muss Apple Daten wie Ihren Namen, Kauf- und Zahlungsinformationen erfassen.
Kommunikation mit Ihnen.
Um auf Mitteilungen zu antworten, Sie bezüglich Ihrer Transaktionen oder Ihres Accounts zu kontaktieren, unsere Produkte und Dienste zu vermarkten, andere relevante Informationen bereitzustellen oder Informationen oder Feedback anzufordern. Gelegentlich können wir personenbezogene Daten nutzen, um wichtige Mitteilungen zu versenden, beispielsweise über Käufe oder Änderungen unserer Geschäftsbedingungen und Richtlinien. Weil diese Informationen für die Beziehung zu Apple wichtig sind, kann man den Erhalt dieser wichtigen Mitteilungen möglicherweise nicht ablehnen.
Sicherheit und Betrugsbekämpfung.
Zum Schutz von Einzelpersonen, Mitarbeiter:innen und Apple sowie zum Schutz vor Verlusten und zur Betrugsbekämpfung, einschließlich des Schutzes von Einzelpersonen, Mitarbeiter:innen und Apple zum Nutzen aller unserer Nutzer:innen und der Vorabsondierung oder Vorabprüfung hochgeladener Inhalte auf potenziell illegale Inhalte, einschließlich Materials zur sexuellen Ausbeutung von Kindern.
Für Zwecke der Personalisierung verwendete personenbezogene Daten.
Wenn Sie sich dafür entscheiden, Ihre Dienste oder Mitteilungen zu personalisieren, sofern dies möglich ist, verwendet Apple die von uns erfassten Daten, um Ihnen diese personalisierten Dienste oder Mitteilungen anbieten zu können. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie die entsprechenden Dienste personenbezogene Daten zur Personalisierung Ihrer Erfahrungen nutzen, finden Sie in den Datenschutzinformationen, die Sie bei der erstmaligen Nutzung eines Dienstes erhalten, der Sie um Zustimmung zur Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten bittet. Wir stellen diese Informationen leicht auffindbar zur Verfügung, indem wir sie mit unserem Datenschutzsymbol kennzeichnen; sie sind auch jederzeit auf Ihrem Apple Gerät und online unter
http://apple.com/de/legal/privacy/data
verfügbar.
Einhaltung von Gesetzen.
Zur Einhaltung des geltenden Rechts – zum Beispiel zur Erfüllung von Steuer- oder Meldepflichten oder zur Erfüllung einer rechtmäßigen Regierungsanfrage.
Apple verwendet ohne die Möglichkeit einer menschlichen Überprüfung keine Algorithmen oder kein Profiling, um eine Entscheidung zu treffen, die Sie erheblich beeinträchtigen würde. Gemäß kalifornischem Recht verwendet Apple darüber hinaus keine sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten oder legt diese offen für Zwecke, die von Nutzer:innen verlangen würden, ein Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung auszuüben.
Apple bewahrt personenbezogene Daten nur so lange auf, wie es für die Erfüllung der Zwecke, für die sie erfasst wurden, erforderlich ist, einschließlich wie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie oder in unseren dienstspezifischen Datenschutzhinweisen beschrieben oder wie gesetzlich vorgeschrieben. Wir bewahren personenbezogene Daten so lange wie notwendig auf, um die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und unseren dienstspezifischen Übersichten zum Datenschutz beschriebenen Zwecke zu erfüllen. Bei der Beurteilung der Aufbewahrungsfristen prüfen wir zunächst sorgfältig, ob es notwendig ist, die erfassten personenbezogenen Daten aufzubewahren, und bewahren, falls eine Aufbewahrung erforderlich ist, die personenbezogenen Daten für den kürzesten gesetzlich zulässigen Zeitraum auf.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten an
Apple Partnerunternehmen
,
Dienstleister,
die in unserem Auftrag handeln, an unsere
Partner
,
Entwickler und Herausgeber
, oder andere
in Ihrem Auftrag tätige Parteien weitergeben
. Darüber hinaus gibt Apple personenbezogene Daten nicht an Dritte für deren eigene Marketingzwecke weiter.
Dienstleister.
Apple ist berechtigt, Drittparteien als unsere Dienstleister zu beauftragen und bestimmte Aufgaben in unserem Namen ausführen zu lassen, zum Beispiel Verarbeitung oder Aufbewahrung von Daten einschließlich personenbezogener Daten im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Nutzung unserer Dienste und der Lieferung von Produkten an unsere Kund:innen. Apple Dienstleister sind verpflichtet, personenbezogene Daten in Übereinstimmung mit dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und gemäß unseren Anweisungen zu verarbeiten. Sie dürfen die von uns weitergegebenen personenbezogenen Daten nicht für ihre eigenen Zwecke verwenden und müssen die personenbezogenen Daten löschen oder zurückgeben, sobald sie unseren Auftrag erfüllt haben.
Partner.
Gelegentlich geht Apple Partnerschaften mit Drittanbietern ein, um Dienste oder andere Angebote bereitzustellen. Beispielsweise werden finanzielle Angebote von Apple wie Apple Card und Apple Cash von Apple und unseren Partnern angeboten. Apple verlangt von seinen Partnern, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen.
Von Ihnen abonnierte Entwickler und Herausgeber.
Wenn Sie im App Store oder in Apple News ein Abonnement eines Dritten erwerben, erstellen wir eine für Sie und den Entwickler oder Herausgeber eindeutige Abonnenten-ID. Die Abonnenten-ID kann verwendet werden, um Berichte an den Entwickler oder Herausgeber zu senden, die Informationen über das von Ihnen erworbene Abonnement und Ihr Wohnsitzland enthalten. Wenn Sie alle Ihre Abonnements bei einem bestimmten Entwickler oder Herausgeber kündigen, wird die Abonnenten-ID nach 180 Tagen zurückgesetzt, sofern Sie kein neues Abonnement abschließen. Diese Informationen werden Entwicklern oder Herausgebern bereitgestellt, damit sie einen Überblick über den Stand ihrer Abonnements haben.
Sonstige.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten in Ihrem Auftrag oder mit Ihrer Zustimmung an andere weitergeben, z. B. wenn wir Informationen an Ihren Mobilfunkanbieter weitergeben, um Ihren Account zu aktivieren. Außerdem können wir Daten über Sie offenlegen, wenn wir der Überzeugung sind, dass dies für die nationale Sicherheit, den Gesetzesvollzug oder andere öffentliche Interessen notwendig oder angemessen ist. Wir können auch Daten über Sie offenlegen, wenn es dafür eine gesetzliche Grundlage gibt, wenn wir feststellen, dass die Offenlegung notwendig ist, um unsere Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen durchzusetzen oder unseren Geschäftsbetrieb oder unsere Nutzer:innen zu schützen, oder im Falle einer Umstrukturierung, Fusion oder eines Verkaufs.
Apple verkauft Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht, auch nicht gemäß der Definition von „Verkauf“ in Nevada und Kalifornien. Darüber hinaus „teilt“ Apple Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht gemäß Definition dieses Begriffs in Kalifornien.
Wir bei Apple glauben, dass guter Datenschutz auf hoher Sicherheit beruht. Wir verwenden
administrative, technische und physische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen
, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten unter Berücksichtigung der Art der Daten und der Verarbeitung sowie der Bedrohungen zu schützen. Wir entwickeln diese Sicherheitsvorkehrungen ständig weiter, um den Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu gewährleisten. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in unserem Leitfaden
Sicherheit der Apple Plattformen
.
Apple ist sich der Bedeutung des Schutzes der personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern bewusst. Als Kinder definieren wir
Personen unter 13 Jahren oder einem entsprechenden in Ihrer Rechtsordnung gesetzlich festgelegten Alter
. Aus diesem Grund hat Apple zusätzliche Verfahren und Schutzmaßnahmen implementiert, um die personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern zu schützen.
Um auf bestimmte Apple Dienste zugreifen zu können, muss ein Kind einen Apple Account besitzen. Ein Apple Account für ein Kind kann durch einen
Elternteil
oder, im Falle eines verwalteten Apple Accounts, durch die
Bildungseinrichtung des Kindes
erstellt werden.
Eltern.
Um einen Kinderaccount zu erstellen, müssen Eltern die
Informationen unter Familien-Datenschutzauskunft für Kinder
lesen. Darin wird beschrieben, wie Apple mit den personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern umgeht. Bei Zustimmung muss ein Elternteil Apple eine nachprüfbare elterliche Zustimmung vorlegen.
Bildungseinrichtungen.
Bildungseinrichtungen, die am Apple School Manager Programm teilnehmen, können auch Apple Accounts für Lernende erstellen, sogenannte „verwaltete Apple Accounts“. Diese Einrichtungen müssen der Vereinbarung
Verwaltete Apple Accounts für Lernende
zustimmen, die als Anhang A des Apple School Manager Vertrags enthalten ist.
Wenn wir erfahren, dass die personenbezogenen Daten eines Kindes ohne entsprechende Genehmigung erfasst wurden, werden sie schnellstmöglich gelöscht.
Um von Ihren Datenschutzrechten für die Informationen Ihres Kindes Gebrauch zu machen, besuchen Sie die Apple Seite für Daten und Datenschutz unter
privacy.apple.com
, und melden Sie sich beim Account des Kindes an.
Auf den Websites, in Onlinediensten, interaktiven Anwendungen und Werbematerialien von Apple werden möglicherweise
„Cookies“ und andere Technologien
wie etwa Webbeacons verwendet.
Diese Technologien erlauben uns, das Nutzerverhalten, u. a. für Sicherheit und Betrugsbekämpfung, besser zu verstehen, informieren uns, welche Teile unserer Websites besucht wurden und vereinfachen und messen die Effizienz von Werbung und der Websuchen.
Kommunikations-Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden verwendet, um den Netzwerkverkehr von und zu den Systemen von Apple zu ermöglichen, einschließlich des Erkennens etwaiger Fehler.
Absolut notwendige Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden bei Bedarf gesetzt, um eine bestimmte Funktion oder einen bestimmten Dienst bereitzustellen, auf die/den Sie zugegriffen oder die/den Sie angefordert haben. Sie ermöglichen es uns zum Beispiel, unsere Websites im richtigen Format und in der richtigen Sprache anzuzeigen, Ihre Transaktionen zu authentifizieren und zu verifizieren und den Inhalt Ihres Einkaufswagens zu speichern, wenn Sie online auf
apple.com/de
einkaufen.
Sonstige Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden verwendet, um zu verstehen, wie Besucher:innen mit unseren Websites und Online-Diensten interagieren, u. a. indem sie uns helfen, die Wirksamkeit von Werbung und Websuchen zu beurteilen. Apple verwendet diese Cookies auch, um die von Ihnen beim Browsen getroffenen Entscheidungen zu speichern, damit wir Ihnen ein individuelles Erlebnis bieten können.
Wenn Sie es vorziehen, dass Apple keine Cookies verwendet, haben Sie die Möglichkeit, deren Verwendung zu deaktivieren. Wenn Sie Cookies deaktivieren möchten und den Webbrowser Safari verwenden, wählen Sie in den Datenschutzeinstellungen von Safari „Alle Cookies blockieren“. Wenn Sie einen anderen Browser verwenden, können Sie sich bei Ihrem Anbieter erkundigen, wie sich Cookies deaktivieren lassen. Bestimmte Funktionen der Apple Website sind möglicherweise nicht verfügbar, wenn alle Cookies deaktiviert sind.
Zusätzlich zu Cookies verwendet Apple andere Technologien, die uns helfen, ähnliche Ziele zu erreichen.
In einigen E-Mail-Nachrichten, die Apple an Sie sendet, geben wir eine „Click-through-URL“ an, über die Sie auf Inhalte auf der Apple Website weitergeleitet werden. Wenn Sie auf diese URLs klicken, werden Sie durch einen separaten Webserver geleitet, bevor Sie zur Zielseite auf unserer Website gelangen. Wir verfolgen diesen „Click-through“, um das Interesse an bestimmten Themen zu ermitteln und zu messen, ob wir effektiv mit Ihnen kommunizieren. Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass solche Daten erfasst und nachverfolgt werden, klicken Sie in E-Mails nicht auf Grafik- oder Text-Links.
Apple behandelt Daten, die wir mit diesen Cookies und ähnlichen Technologien erfassen, im Allgemeinen als nicht personenbezogene Daten.
In dem Ausmaß, zu dem Internet-Protokolladressen (IP-Adressen) oder ähnliche Identifizierungsmerkmale durch anwendbares Recht als personenbezogene Daten eingestuft werden, behandeln wir diese Identifizierungsmerkmale ebenfalls als personenbezogene Daten. Darüber hinaus kombiniert Apple manchmal nicht personenbezogene Daten, die mit diesen Technologien erfasst wurden, mit anderen personenbezogenen Daten, die Apple aufbewahrt. Wenn wir Daten auf diese Weise kombinieren, behandeln wir die kombinierten Daten für die Zwecke dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie als personenbezogene Daten.
Anzeigen, die über die Werbeplattform von Apple bereitgestellt werden, können in App Store, in Apple News, in der App „Aktien“ und in der Apple TV App angezeigt werden. Die Werbeplattform von Apple verfolgt Sie nicht, was bedeutet, dass sie keine Nutzer- oder Gerätedaten, die von unseren Apps erfasst wurden, mit Nutzer- oder Gerätedaten verknüpft, die von Dritten für zielgerichtete Werbe- oder Werbemessungszwecke erfasst wurden, und keine Nutzer- oder Gerätedaten an Datenvermittler weitergibt.
Wenn Sie in diesen Apps keine auf Ihre Interessen zugeschnittene Werbung von der Apple Werbeplattform erhalten möchten, können Sie „Personalisierte Werbung“ deaktivieren. Damit deaktivieren Sie derartige Werbung für Ihren Apple Account – unabhängig vom verwendeten Gerät. Auf Ihrem iOS, iPadOS oder visionOS Gerät können Sie „Personalisierte Werbung“ deaktivieren, indem Sie „Einstellungen“ > „Datenschutz & Sicherheit“ > „Apple Werbung“ wählen und auf „Personalisierte Werbung“ tippen, um sie zu deaktivieren. Auf Ihrem Mac können Sie „Personalisierte Werbung“ deaktivieren, indem Sie „Systemeinstellungen“ > „Datenschutz & Sicherheit“ > „Datenschutz“ > „Werbung“ wählen und auf „Personalisierte Werbung“ tippen, um sie zu deaktivieren. Sie sehen unter Umständen dennoch kontextbasierte Werbung im App Store oder bei Apple News und Aktien auf der Basis Ihrer Suchanfrage oder des Channels, den Sie lesen. Wenn Sie „Apps erlauben, Tracking anzufordern“ deaktivieren, können Apps von Drittanbietern nicht auf die Anzeigenkennung zugreifen (eine nicht personenbezogene Kennung, die vom Betriebssystem auf Ihrem Gerät bereitgestellt wird), um Sie über Apps und Websites anderer Unternehmen nachzuverfolgen.
Weitere Informationen zur von Apple bereitgestellten Werbung und zum Datenschutz finden Sie unter
apple.com/legal/privacy/data/de/apple-advertising
.
Die Produkte und Angebote von Apple verbinden Sie mit der Welt. Um dies zu ermöglichen,
können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Einrichtungen auf der ganzen Welt,
einschließlich Apple Partnerunternehmen, übertragen oder von diesen eingesehen werden, um Verarbeitungsaktivitäten durchzuführen, wie sie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie in Verbindung mit Ihrer Nutzung unserer Produkte und Dienste beschrieben werden. Apple hält sich an die Gesetze zur Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten zwischen Ländern, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Daten an jedem Ort stets geschützt sind.
Der Apple Rechtsträger, der Ihre personenbezogenen Daten kontrolliert, kann je nach Ihrem Wohnort variieren.
Beispielsweise werden Apple Store Informationen von einzelnen Retail Einrichtungen in jedem Land kontrolliert und personenbezogene Daten in Bezug auf Apple Media Services können, wie in den Servicebedingungen angegeben, von verschiedenen Apple Rechtsträgern kontrolliert werden. Wenn Sie nicht in den USA leben, können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten von Apple Inc. und anderen Apple Partnerunternehmen im Auftrag des Apple Rechtsträgers verarbeitet werden, der die personenbezogenen Daten für Ihre Gerichtsbarkeit kontrolliert. Beispielsweise werden Bilder und zugehörige Daten, die Apple weltweit erfasst, um Apple Karten zu verbessern und unsere Funktion „Umsehen“ zu unterstützen, an Apple Inc. in Kalifornien übertragen.
Personenbezogene Daten, die sich auf Einzelpersonen im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum, in Großbritannien und der Schweiz beziehen, werden von Apple Distribution International Limited in Irland kontrolliert. Die internationale Übermittlung von personenbezogenen Daten, die im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum, in Großbritannien und der Schweiz erfasst werden, durch Apple wird durch die
Standardvertragsklauseln
geregelt. Wenn Sie Fragen haben oder ein Exemplar der Apple Standardvertragsklauseln haben möchten, wenden Sie sich an
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
.
Personenbezogene Daten, die von
Apple oder einem Apple Partnerunternehmen
weltweit erfasst werden, werden in der Regel von Apple Inc. In den USA gespeichert. Unabhängig davon, wo Ihre personenbezogenen Daten gespeichert sind, sorgt Apple stets für das gleiche hohe Maß an Schutz und Schutzmaßnahmen.
Die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebenen Datenschutzpraktiken von Apple entsprechen dem Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs)-System und dem Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP)-System. Weitere Informationen zu diesen beiden Systemen
finden Sie hier

Personenbezogene Daten von Personen in der Volksrepublik China können von Apple in Ländern außerhalb der Volksrepublik China verarbeitet werden, wie Apple Inc. in den USA oder Apple Distribution International Limited in der Republik Irland. Wo dies der Fall ist, geschieht dies in Übereinstimmung mit den örtlichen Gesetzen, einschließlich des Gesetzes zum Schutz personenbezogener Daten. Für die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie dargelegten Zwecke der Verarbeitung kann Apple solche personenbezogenen Daten auch an externe Dienstanbieter übertragen, die die Daten wiederum außerhalb der Volksrepublik China speichern oder übertragen können. Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter
Datenschutzangaben für Festlandchina
.
Damit die Sicherheit personenbezogener Daten gewährleistet ist, werden unsere Richtlinien über die Persönlichkeitsrechte und Sicherheitsvorkehrungen allen Mitarbeiter:innen von Apple bekannt gegeben und die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen zum Schutz der Persönlichkeitsrechte innerhalb des Unternehmens streng umgesetzt.
Wenn Sie Fragen zur Apple Datenschutzrichtlinie oder zu den Datenschutzpraktiken von Apple haben, einschließlich der Fälle, in denen ein Drittanbieter in unserem Namen handelt, oder unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten kontaktieren möchten, können Sie uns unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
erreichen oder die
Apple Support-Telefonnummer
für Ihr Land oder Ihre Region anrufen.
Sie können uns auch Fragen dazu stellen, wie Sie eine Datenschutzbeschwerde einreichen können, und wir werden unser Möglichstes tun, um Ihnen zu helfen.
Apple nimmt Ihre Fragen zum Datenschutz ernst. Ein kompetentes Team prüft Ihre Anfrage, um festzustellen, wie Ihre Frage oder Ihr Anliegen am besten beantwortet werden kann, einschließlich jener Anfragen, die als Antwort auf eine Zugriffs- oder Downloadanfrage eingehen. In den meisten Fällen erhalten alle wesentlichen Kontaktanfragen innerhalb von sieben Tagen eine Antwort. In anderen Fällen benötigen wir möglicherweise zusätzliche Informationen oder teilen Ihnen mit, dass unsere Antwort mehr Zeit in Anspruch nimmt.
Wenn Sie in Ihrer Beschwerde darauf hinweisen, dass wir den Umgang mit Datenschutzthemen verbessern könnten, werden wir entsprechende Schritte unternehmen, um dies bei der nächstmöglichen Gelegenheit umzusetzen. Falls sich ein Problem mit dem Datenschutz negativ auf Sie oder eine andere Person ausgewirkt hat, werden wir entsprechende Schritte unternehmen, um das Problem für Sie oder die andere Person zu lösen.
Sie können jederzeit – auch wenn Sie mit der Antwort von Apple nicht zufrieden sind – Ihre Beschwerde an die zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde weiterleiten. Auf Ihre Anfrage hin versuchen wir Ihnen Informationen darüber bereitzustellen, welche Beschwerdewege Ihnen in Ihrem Fall zur Verfügung stehen.
Bei einer wesentlichen Änderung an dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie werden wir mindestens eine Woche im Voraus eine Mitteilung auf dieser Website veröffentlichen und Sie direkt über die Änderung informieren, wenn uns Ihre Daten vorliegen.

We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.

We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.

the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Andere PayPal-Unternehmen
, um Ihnen die Dienste bereitzustellen, sowie in unserem berechtigten Interesse an der Ausübung unserer Geschäftstätigkeit. Diese Interessen werden in Abschnitt 5 (
Welche personenbezogenen Daten verwendet werden und auf welchen Rechtsgrundlagen dies beruht
)
näher erläutert. Das PayPal-Unternehmen, das Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erhält, verarbeitet diese in Einklang mit dieser Datenschutzerklärung.
Behörden
, soweit wir rechtlich dazu verpflichtet sind. Dazu zählen Steuerbehörden, Polizeibehörden, Strafverfolgungsbehörden und Aufsichtsbehörden in den jeweils maßgeblichen Ländern. Wir können auch verpflichtet sein, zuständigen Behörden, wie beispielsweise den Finanzbehörden, Informationen über Ihre Nutzung unserer Dienste zur Verfügung zu stellen. Dies kann Ihren Namen, Ihre Adresse und Informationen zu Kartentransaktionen umfassen, die wir in Ihrem Auftrag über unsere Dienste abwickeln. Die Rechtsgrundlage für die Einhaltung von Offenlegungspflichten, die sich aus dem Recht der EU und der Mitgliedstaaten ergeben, ist die bestehende rechtliche Verpflichtung. Soweit die Offenlegung nicht auf dem Recht der EU und der Mitgliedstaaten beruht, ist die Rechtsgrundlage unser berechtigtes Interesse und die Einhaltung geltender Vorschriften zur Verhinderung widerrechtlichen Verhaltens.
Andere Finanzinstitute und Kartennetzwerke
, um die Zahlungsabwicklung zu erleichtern, gemeinsam ein Produkt anzubieten oder Karten Ihrer E-Börse hinzuzufügen. Die Rechtsgrundlage für die Offenlegung ist die Erfüllung des zwischen Ihnen und uns bestehenden Vertrags. Die betreffenden Parteien können auch für andere berechtigte Zwecke auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zugreifen, wie etwa Identitätsprüfung, Betrugsprävention und Risikomanagement. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist das berechtigte Interesse von uns und unseren Partnern, betrügerisches und rechtswidriges Verhalten zu verhindern.
Betrugsbekämpfungs- und Identitätsprüfungsbehörden
, zum Beispiel, um uns bei der Erkennung von Aktivitäten zu unterstützen, die auf Betrug hindeuten. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist das berechtigte Interesse von uns und unseren Partnern, betrügerisches und rechtswidriges Verhalten zu verhindern.
Inkassobüros
, beispielsweise um unbezahlte überfällige Forderungen durch Dritte wie ein Inkassobüro einzuziehen. Wir tun dies auf der Grundlage unseres berechtigten Interesses, Geschäfte zu tätigen und Schulden einzutreiben. Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Datenschutzerklärung dieser Parteien für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten gilt, die Sie ihnen direkt mitteilen, und dass sie Ihre unbezahlten Schulden Kreditauskunfteien melden können, was Ihre Kreditwürdigkeit oder Ihre Fähigkeit zur Sicherung zukünftiger Kredite beeinträchtigen kann.
Dienstanbieter
, die in unserem Auftrag und nach unseren Weisungen Dienstleistungen erbringen, die wir an sie ausgelagert haben, wie z.B. Marketing, IT-Entwicklung, Wartung, Hosting und Support sowie Kundenserviceleistungen. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist die Erfüllung unserer gegenüber Ihnen bestehenden Vertragspflichten.
Andere Nutzer, soweit dies ausweislich Ihrer Kontoeinstellungen zulässig ist
. Über Ihre Kontoeinstellungen können Sie anderen Nutzern bestimmte Informationen wie Ihr Profilfoto, Ihren Vor- und Nachnamen, Ihren Benutzernamen oder Ihren Wohnort anzeigen oder zugänglich machen. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist Ihre Einwilligung. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Sie Ihre Profileinstellungen jederzeit und kostenfrei ändern können.
Finanzinstitute in Verbindung mit Ihrer Teilnahme an Open Banking
, z.B. wenn Sie eine Kontoverbindung mit einer anderen Bank, einem Kartenkonto oder einem Aggregator einleiten. Wir prüfen daher, ob Sie über genügend Geld verfügen, oder bestätigen, dass Sie der Inhaber des Kontos sind. Wenn Sie Ihr Konto verknüpfen, ist die Rechtsgrundlage für den Zugriff auf Ihre Kontodaten die Erfüllung unserer vertraglichen Verpflichtungen gegenüber Ihnen.
Partner und Händler, deren Dienstanbieter und sonstige Transaktionsbeteiligte
. Wenn Sie beispielsweise die Dienste nutzen, um Online-Einkäufe zu tätigen, Zahlungen an andere Nutzer vorzunehmen oder Waren zurückzugeben, können wir Informationen über Sie und Ihr Konto an die anderen Parteien weitergeben, die an der Abwicklung Ihrer Transaktionen beteiligt sind. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist die Erfüllung unserer gegenüber Ihnen bestehenden Vertragspflichten sowie unser berechtigtes Interesse. Bitte beachten Sie, dass für personenbezogene Daten, die an Partner und Händler (oder deren Dienstanbieter) weitergegeben werden, welche an einer Transaktion beteiligt sind, die eigenen Datenschutzerklärungen und Verfahren der Partner und Händler gelten.
Externe, unabhängige Datenverantwortliche
, wenn wir beispielsweise personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien, Erwerber und andere Finanzinstitute weitergeben oder an Sicherheitsprodukte, um zu verhindern, dass Bots auf unsere Dienste zugreifen können.
Bitte beachten Sie, dass für die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie direkt an diese Parteien weitergeben, deren Datenschutzerklärungen gelten
. So verwenden wir beispielsweise reCAPTCHA von Google, um Missbrauch unserer Dienste zu verhindern, wenn Sie auf unsere PayPal-App zugreifen. Die
Datenschutzerklärung
und die
Nutzungsbedingungen
von Google gelten für die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie an Google weitergeben. Weitere Informationen zu Kreditauskunfteien, mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten, um Ihre Kreditwürdigkeit zu bewerten, finden Sie in Abschnitt 12 (
Warum wir personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben
).
Käufer oder sonstige Weitergabe in Verbindung mit einer Geschäftsübertragung
. Wenn wir beispielsweise ein Geschäft oder Vermögenswerte veräußern, können wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an einen Käufer dieses Geschäfts oder dieser Vermögenswerte weitergeben. Ebenso können personenbezogene Daten weitergegeben werden, wenn PayPal oder ein wesentlicher Teil des PayPal-Vermögens von einer dritten Partei erworben wird. PayPal hat ein berechtigtes Interesse daran, derartige Transaktionen durchführen zu können.
7. Wie lange Ihre personenbezogenen Daten von PayPal gespeichert werden
Wir speichern personenbezogene Daten so lange, wie es im Rahmen des Zwecks, für den sie erhoben wurden, und in Übereinstimmung mit dem geltenden Recht benötigt oder zulässig ist.
Die Kriterien für die Bestimmung der Aufbewahrungsfrist lauten:
Personenbezogene Daten, die für die laufende Beziehung zwischen Ihnen und PayPal genutzt werden, werden für die Dauer der Beziehung zuzüglich eines Zeitraums von zehn Jahren gespeichert
Personenbezogene Daten in Bezug auf eine rechtliche Verpflichtung, der wir unterliegen, werden im Einklang mit geltendem Recht aufbewahrt, wie z.B. gemäß geltendem Insolvenzrecht und AML-Verpflichtungen.
Wir speichern personenbezogene Daten so lange wie nötig, wenn die Aufbewahrung angesichts von Rechtsstreitigkeiten, Ermittlungen, Audit- und Compliance-Praktiken oder zum Schutz vor Rechtsansprüchen ratsam ist.
8. Internationale Übermittlung von personenbezogenen Daten
Da wir in zahlreichen Ländern tätig sind, kann es vorkommen, dass wir (oder unsere Dienstanbieter) Ihre Daten außerhalb des Landes, in dem Sie leben, übermitteln und verarbeiten. Um Ihre Daten in den Vereinigten Staaten und anderen Ländern zu verarbeiten und zu speichern, setzen wir externe Dienstanbieter ein. In den betreffenden Ländern ist nicht immer ein gleichwertiger Datenschutz gegeben. Wir haben daher konkrete Maßnahmen in Übereinstimmung mit dem Datenschutzrecht der EU und Großbritanniens getroffen, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen. Bei der Übermittlung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zwischen PayPal-Unternehmen stützen wir uns auf von den zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörden genehmigte bindende Unternehmensregeln (abrufbar
hier
). Andere Übermittlungen erfolgen auf der Grundlage von Standardvertragsklauseln, die von der Europäischen Kommission genehmigt wurden, damit gewährleistet ist, dass Ihre Daten einen hohen Schutzstandard genießen und Ihre Datenschutzrechte gewahrt bleiben.
9. Wie wir Cookies und Tracking-Technologien verwenden
Wenn Sie mit unseren Diensten interagieren, E-Mails öffnen, die wir Ihnen senden, oder eine Website eines Drittanbieters besuchen, für die wir Dienste bereitstellen, verwenden wir und unsere Partner Cookies und andere Tracking-Technologien wie Pixel-Tags, Web-Beacons und Widgets (zusammen „
Cookies
“), um Sie als Benutzer zu erkennen, Ihre Online-Erfahrungen und Online-Inhalte anzupassen, einschließlich um Ihnen interessenbezogene Werbung bereitzustellen, Analysen durchzuführen, Risiken zu mindern und potenziellen Betrug zu verhindern und Vertrauen und Sicherheit auf unseren Websites und Diensten zu fördern. Bestimmte Aspekte und Funktionen unserer Dienste und Websites sind nur durch die Verwendung von Cookies verfügbar. Wenn Sie also bestimmte Cookies ablehnen, kann Ihre Nutzung der Websites und Dienste eingeschränkt oder nicht möglich sein.
Wir verwenden Cookies, um Ihre Geräteinformationen, Informationen zu Internetaktivitäten und Rückschlüsse wie oben beschrieben zu sammeln.
Cookies helfen uns, Folgendes zu tun:
Ihre Daten zu speichern, damit Sie sie nicht erneut eingeben müssen
Zu verfolgen und verstehen, wie Sie unsere Online-Dienste und E-Mails nutzen und mit ihnen interagieren
Unsere Online-Dienste an Ihre Einstellungen anzupassen
Zu messen, wie nützlich und effektiv unsere Dienste und Kommunikation für Sie sind
Unsere Produkte und Dienste zu verwalten und zu verbessern
Do Not Track (DNT) ist eine optionale Browser-Einstellung, mit der Sie Ihre Präferenzen bezüglich der Nachverfolgung Ihrer Handlungen im Internet durch Werbetreibende und andere Dritte festlegen können. Derzeit sind unsere Websites nicht darauf ausgelegt, auf DNT-Signale oder ähnliche Mechanismen von Browsern zu reagieren.
Näheres zu unserer Verwendung von Cookies erfahren Sie in unserer
Erklärung zu Cookies und Tracking-Technologien
.
10. Ihre Datenschutzrechte
Nach geltendem Datenschutzrecht haben Sie bestimmte Rechte, unsere Erfassung und Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu kontrollieren. Zu Ihren Rechten gehören:
Zugriff, Berichtigung, Löschung, Widerspruch, Übertragbarkeit und Einschränkung Ihrer Informationen
Wir erkennen an, wie wichtig es ist, dass Sie die Kontrolle über die Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten haben. Daher bieten wir Ihnen verschiedene Möglichkeiten, Ihre Rechte auf Zugriff, Auskunft, Berichtigung (durch Korrektur oder Aktualisierung), Löschung, Widerspruch, Übertragbarkeit und Einschränkung der Verarbeitung ganz oder teilweise auszuüben.
Wenn Sie ein Konto haben, können Sie Ihre Datenschutzrechte ausüben, indem Sie in den Kontoeinstellungen der PayPal-App auf "Daten und Datenschutz" zugreifen. Auch ohne Konto (z.B. wenn Sie die Funktion "Zahlung ohne PayPal-Konto" nutzen) können Sie in Bezug auf Daten zu Transaktionen, die mit der Funktion "Zahlung ohne PayPal-Konto" durchgeführt wurden, Auskunft, Änderung, Berichtigung oder Löschung verlangen. Ersuchen zu den Daten einer anderen Person können Sie einreichen, indem Sie sich mit uns in Verbindung setzen, sofern Sie ordnungsgemäß bevollmächtigt sind. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir von Ihnen gegebenenfalls zusätzliche Verifizierungsinformationen anfordern.
Ihr Recht, den automatisierten Entscheidungen und der Profilerstellung zu widersprechen
Falls Sie im Rahmen der unten beschriebenen automatisierten Entscheidungen nicht zugelassen sind, haben Sie keinen Zugang zu unseren Dienstleistungen, wie beispielsweise unseren Zahlungsmethoden. PayPal verfügt über verschiedene Sicherheitsmechanismen, um die Angemessenheit der Entscheidungen zu gewährleisten. Zu diesen Mechanismen gehören laufende Überprüfungen unserer Entscheidungsmodelle und fallweise Stichproben. Wenn Sie bezüglich des Ergebnisses Bedenken haben, können Sie uns
kontaktieren
. Wir werden dann überprüfen, ob das Verfahren korrekt durchgeführt wurde.
Sie haben das Recht, einer automatisierten Entscheidung zu widersprechen, wenn deren Rechtsfolgen oder Ergebnisse geeignet sind, (zusammen mit dem entsprechenden Profiling) in sonstiger Weise erhebliche Auswirkungen auf Sie zu haben, indem Sie uns
kontaktieren
. Wir prüfen die Entscheidung sodann unter Berücksichtigung der zusätzlichen Umstände.
Zustimmung
Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten mit Ihrer Zustimmung verwenden, haben Sie im Allgemeinen das Recht, Ihre Zustimmung jederzeit zu widerrufen, ohne die Rechtmäßigkeit der Verarbeitung aufgrund der Zustimmung vor ihrem Widerruf zu beeinträchtigen.
Die Rechtmäßigkeit einer Verarbeitung, die vor Ihrem Widerruf stattgefunden hat, wird durch den Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung nicht berührt. Das gleiche gilt für die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten auf der Grundlage eines anderen Rechtsgrundes als Ihrer Einwilligung.
Widerspruchsrecht gegen Direktmarketing
Sofern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für Direktmarketingzwecke verwenden, können Sie jederzeit Ihre Berechtigungseinstellungen ändern, widersprechen und sich über den Abmeldelink in elektronischen Mitteilungen bzw. über Ihre Kontoeinstellungen von zukünftigen Direktmarketingnachrichten abmelden.
Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Verarbeitung berechtigter Interessen
Verwenden wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zur Verfolgung berechtigter Interessen von uns oder einem Dritten, haben Sie das Recht, der Verwendung für diesen Zweck zu widersprechen. Näheres dazu finden Sie in Abschnitt 5 (
Welche personenbezogenen Daten verwendet werden und auf welchen Rechtsgrundlagen dies beruht
)
Wie nehmen Sie Ihre Rechte wahr, und wie können Sie uns oder die Datenschutzbehörde kontaktieren?
Wenn Sie aus irgendeinem Grund mit unserer Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten unzufrieden sind, haben Sie das Recht, eine Beschwerde bei der Aufsichtsbehörde für den Datenschutz in Ihrem Land einzureichen.
Unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten erreichen Sie online oder per Post unter PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A, 22-24 Boulevard Royal L-2449, Luxemburg.

den örtlichen Gerichten
Rechtsmittel einlegen.
Sie können auch bei der für uns zuständigen
führenden Aufsichtsbehörde für den Datenschutz
, der Nationalen Kommission für Datenschutz des Großherzogtums Luxemburg (CNPD), eine Beschwerde einreichen. Die betreffende Postanschrift lautet: Commission nationale pour la protection des données, Service des plaints, 15, Boulevard du Jazz, L-4370 Belvaux, Luxemburg.

11. Nähere Informationen zu automatisierter Entscheidungsfindung und Profiling
"
Automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung
" ist der Prozess der vollautomatischen Entscheidungsfindung ohne menschliche Beteiligung. In einigen Fällen könnten diese Entscheidungen
rechtliche oder ähnlich erhebliche Auswirkungen
auf Sie als natürliche Person haben. "
Profiling
" bezeichnet Analysen der Persönlichkeit, des Verhaltens, des Interesses und der Gewohnheiten einer Person, um Vorhersagen oder Entscheidungen über sie zu treffen. Soweit dies nach dem Recht der EU oder der Mitgliedstaaten zulässig oder für den Abschluss oder die Erfüllung eines Vertrags erforderlich ist, können wir in einigen Fällen automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung oder Profiling für Entscheidungen verwenden. Ein Beispiel für unseren Einsatz automatisierter Entscheidungsfindung ist die Bewertung Ihrer Kreditwürdigkeit, um Ihre Eignung für bestimmte Kreditprodukte zu beurteilen.
Wir glauben, dass PayPal durch das automatische Treffen solcher Entscheidungen seine Objektivität und Transparenz bei der Entscheidung, welche Dienste Ihnen angeboten werden, erhöht. Wir setzen mehrere Sicherheitsmechanismen ein, um sicherzustellen, dass die Entscheidungen angemessen sind. Zu diesen Mechanismen gehören laufende Übersichten unserer Entscheidungsmodelle und Stichproben im Einzelfall. Sie können stattdessen jederzeit eine manuelle Entscheidungsfindung verlangen, Ihre Meinung äußern oder eine Entscheidungsfindung anfechten, die ausschließlich auf einer automatisierten Verarbeitung, einschließlich Profiling, beruht, wenn eine solche Entscheidung
rechtliche Wirkung entfaltet oder Sie in ähnlicher Weise erheblich beeinträchtigt
. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie Sie diesen Entscheidungen widersprechen können, finden Sie in Abschnitt 10
("Ihre Datenschutzrechte")
.
Wenden Sie sich
online
an unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten, wenn Sie mehr über die Nutzung von automatisierter Entscheidungsfindung oder Profiling erfahren möchten.
12. Warum wir personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben
Haben Sie einen Kredit beantragt oder nutzen Sie unsere Kreditdienste, können wir zur Bearbeitung Ihres Antrags Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben, die uns Informationen über Sie geben, wie z.B. Ihre Finanzhistorie. Dies geschieht, um Kreditwürdigkeit und Produkteignung zu beurteilen, Ihre Identität zu überprüfen, offene Forderungen zu ermitteln und einzuziehen sowie kriminelle Handlungen zu verhindern.
Die Rechtsgrundlagen für diese Übermittlungen finden sich in Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe b (vertraglich) und Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe f (berechtigtes Interesse) der EU-Datenschutzgrundverordnung ("EU-DSGVO").
Wir werden auch weiterhin laufend Informationen über Sie mit Kreditauskunfteien austauschen, einschließlich über Ihre beglichenen Konten und alle Schulden, die nicht rechtzeitig vollständig zurückgezahlt wurden. Diese Informationen können von CRAs an andere Organisationen weitergegeben werden, um ähnliche Überprüfungen durchzuführen und Ihren Aufenthaltsort zu ermitteln und Schulden einzutreiben.
Ihre Daten werden auch mit den Daten aller gemeinsamen Bewerber oder anderer Finanzpartner verknüpft.
So erfahren Sie mehr
Wenden Sie sich
online
an unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten, wenn Sie mehr darüber erfahren möchten, welche Kreditauskunfteien wir für eine bestimmte Suche eingesetzt haben.
Hier
finden Sie die Liste der in Großbritannien und dem EWR genutzten Kreditauskunfteien, einschließlich der Identitäten der in den jeweiligen Ländern genutzten Kreditauskunfteien und eines Links zu deren Datenschutzerklärung, aus der Sie entnehmen können, wie diese personenbezogene Daten verwenden und weitergeben, einschließlich der Dauer der Speicherung dieser personenbezogenen Daten. Sie können sich an die Kreditauskunfteien, die im Land Ihres Wohnsitzes tätig sind, direkt wenden, wenn Sie Fragen zu deren Dienstleistungen, Ihrem Kreditscore oder zu den über Sie gespeicherten Daten haben. Das gleiche gilt, wenn Sie gegenüber den Kreditauskunfteien Ihre Rechte als betroffene Person ausüben möchten.
13. Wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten schützen
Wir führen technische, physische und administrative Sicherheitsmaßnahmen durch, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten angemessen vor Verlust, Missbrauch, unbefugtem Zugriff, Weitergabe und Änderung zu schützen. Zu diesen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen gehören Firewalls, Datenverschlüsselung, physische Zugangsbeschränkungen für unsere Rechenzentren und Berechtigungskontrollen für den Zugriff auf Daten. Wir sorgen für die Sicherung unserer Systeme und Dienste. Für die Sicherheit und die Geheimhaltung Ihres Passworts bzw. Ihrer Passwörter und Ihres Kontoprofils bzw. Ihrer Anmeldedaten sind Sie jedoch selbst verantwortlich. Darüber hinaus liegt es in Ihrer Verantwortung zu prüfen, dass die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir über Sie besitzen, richtig und auf dem aktuellen Stand sind. Wir haften nicht für den Schutz personenbezogener Daten, die wir auf Grundlage einer von Ihnen autorisierten Kontoverknüpfung an Dritte weitergeben.
14. Können Kinder unsere Dienste nutzen?
Wir erfassen wissentlich keine Informationen, einschließlich personenbezogener Daten, von Kindern unter 16 Jahren oder anderen Personen, die rechtlich nicht in der Lage sind, unsere Websites und Dienste zu nutzen. Wenn wir tatsächliche Kenntnis davon erhalten, dass wir personenbezogene Daten von jemandem erhoben haben, der unsere Dienste nicht nutzen darf, werden wir diese unverzüglich löschen, es sei denn, wir sind gesetzlich verpflichtet, diese Daten aufzubewahren.
Bitte
kontaktieren Sie uns
, wenn Sie glauben, dass wir irrtümlich oder unbeabsichtigt Daten von jemandem erhoben haben, der zur Nutzung unserer Dienste nicht berechtigt ist.
15. Aktualisierungen dieser Datenschutzerklärung
Diese Datenschutzerklärung wird von Zeit zu Zeit überarbeitet, um Änderungen an unserer Geschäftstätigkeit, unseren Diensten oder den geltenden Gesetzen Rechnung zu tragen. Wenn nach geltendem Recht auf die überarbeitete Fassung hinzuweisen ist, informieren wir Sie 30 Tage im Voraus durch Bekanntgabe der Änderung auf der Seite
AGB-Aktualisierungen
oder der Seite
Datenschutzerklärung
. Andernfalls wird die überarbeitete Datenschutzerklärung ab dem angegebenen Startdatum wirksam.
16. Hinweis zu Bankvorschriften für Nutzer im EWR und in Großbritannien
In der Regel verlangt das luxemburgische Recht, dem PayPal (in Bezug auf Datenschutz und Bankgeheimnis) unterliegt, einen höheren Grad an Transparenz als die meisten anderen Rechtsordnungen in der EU. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten Anbietern von Internet- oder Finanzdienstleistungen in der EU listen wir daher in dieser Datenschutzerklärung die Drittanbieter und Geschäftspartner, die Dienstleistungen für uns erbringen und denen gegenüber wir Ihre Daten offenlegen, sowie den Zweck der Offenlegung und die Art der offengelegten Daten auf. Einen Link zu diesen Drittanbietern finden Sie
hier
. Dadurch, dass Sie diese Datenschutzerklärung annehmen und ein Konto bei PayPal haben, willigen Sie ausdrücklich in die Übermittlung Ihrer Daten an diese Drittanbieter für die aufgeführten Zwecke ein.
PayPal kann die oben genannte Drittanbieterliste am ersten Werktag eines jeden Quartals (d.h. im Januar, April, Juli und Oktober) aktualisieren. PayPal beginnt erst 30 Tage nach dem Datum der Veröffentlichung der Liste innerhalb der Datenschutzerklärung mit der Übermittlung von Daten an eines der in der jeweiligen Aktualisierung neu aufgeführten Unternehmen oder für die dort neu aufgeführten Zwecke oder Datentypen. Sie sollten sich in jedem Quartal zu den oben genannten Terminen auf der PayPal-Website erneut mit der Liste vertraut machen. Wenn Sie der neuen Form der Datenübertragung nicht innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach Veröffentlichung der aktualisierten Drittanbieterliste widersprechen, gelten die Änderungen der Liste und dieser Datenschutzerklärung als von Ihnen angenommen. Sind Sie mit den Änderungen nicht einverstanden, steht es Ihnen frei, Ihr Konto zu schließen und unsere Dienste nicht mehr zu nutzen.
Um die PayPal-Dienste bereitstellen zu können, müssen wir möglicherweise bestimmte Daten, die wir (wie in dieser Datenschutzerklärung dargelegt) erhoben haben, an andere mit PayPal verbundene Unternehmen oder sonstige Stellen übermitteln, einschließlich solcher, die gemäß diesem Abschnitt eine Funktion als Zahlungsdienstleister, Zahlungsanbieter oder Kontoinhaber (oder ähnliche Funktionen) erfüllen. Sie erkennen an, dass diese Stellen in ihren jeweiligen Rechtsordnungen Gesetzen, Vorschriften, Untersuchungen, Ermittlungen oder Anordnungen unterworfen sein können, durch die sie zur Weitergabe von Daten an die zuständigen Behörden des betreffenden Landes verpflichtet sind. Durch die Nutzung der PayPal-Dienste willigen Sie in die Übermittlung solcher Daten durch uns zum Zweck der Bereitstellung der PayPal-Dienste an Sie ein.
Insbesondere stimmen Sie allen folgenden Datenverarbeitungsmaßnahmen zu und weisen PayPal an, diese vorzunehmen:
a. Offenlegung notwendiger Informationen gegenüber der Polizei und anderen Strafverfolgungsbehörden, Sicherheitskräften, zuständigen staatlichen, zwischenstaatlichen oder überstaatlichen Stellen, zuständigen Behörden, Abteilungen, Aufsichtsbehörden, Selbstregulierungsbehörden oder -organisationen (einschließlich der
hier
im Abschnitt "Behörden" der Drittanbieterliste genannten Stellen) und anderen Dritten, einschließlich Unternehmen der PayPal-Gruppe, (i) deren Weisungen wir gesetzlich verpflichtet und befugt sind, einzuhalten, unter anderem aufgrund der luxemburgischen Gesetze vom 24. Juli 2015 über das US-amerikanische Gesetz zur Einhaltung der Steuervorschriften für Auslandskonten ("FATCA-Gesetz") und vom 18. Dezember 2015 über die einvernehmlich festgelegten Standards für die Berichterstattung der OECD ("CRS-Gesetz"), (ii) bei denen wir Grund zu der Annahme haben, dass die Kooperation mit ihnen bei der Untersuchung von Betrugsfällen oder sonstigen tatsächlichen oder mutmaßlichen widerrechtlichen Aktivitäten geboten ist, oder (iii) zur Ermittlung von Verstößen gegen unsere Nutzungsbedingungen (dies gilt auch für Ihre Zahlungsquelle oder Ihren Kredit- oder Debitkartenanbieter).
Wenn Sie in den Geltungsbereich des FATCA- oder des CRS-Gesetzes fallen, sind wir dazu verpflichtet, Sie über die Weitergabe von Daten an die jeweiligen Behörden zu unterrichten. Informieren Sie sich über die Verpflichtungen von PayPal nach dem FATCA- und dem CRS-Gesetz sowie darüber, welche Auswirkungen diese Verpflichtungen für Sie haben können und welche Informationen wir gegebenenfalls im Zuge dieser Verpflichtungen weitergeben.
Wir und weitere Organisationen, einschließlich von Unternehmen, die Zahlungen über PayPal akzeptieren, können notwendige Daten (darunter auch Daten, die von Betrugsbekämpfungsstellen aufgezeichnet wurden, und Daten aus anderen Ländern) zum Zwecke der Bewertung und Verwaltung von Risiken (wie z.B. zur Verhinderung von Betrug, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung) weitergeben, nutzen und auf sie zugreifen. Bitte wenden Sie sich an uns, wenn Sie weitere Informationen über die jeweiligen Betrugsbekämpfungsstellen wünschen. Klicken Sie
hier
, um weitere Informationen zu diesen Behörden, den Betrugsbekämpfungsstellen und sonstigen Dritten zu erhalten.
b. Offenlegung von Kontoinformationen gegenüber Inhabern von geistigem Eigentum, wenn diese nach dem maßgeblichen nationalen Recht eines EU-Mitgliedstaates einen außergerichtlichen Auskunftsanspruch gegen PayPal aufgrund einer Verletzung ihrer geistigen Eigentumsrechte haben, bei der PayPal-Dienste genutzt wurden (zum Beispiel § 19, Absatz 2, Unterabsatz 3 des deutschen Markengesetzes oder § 101, Absatz 2, Unterabsatz 3 des deutschen Urheberrechtsgesetzes).
c. Obligatorische Offenlegung aufgrund von Kreditkartenbestimmungen oder in straf- oder zivilrechtlichen Verfahren.
d. Offenlegung Ihres Namens und PayPal-Links im PayPal-Benutzerverzeichnis. Ihre Daten werden anderen PayPal-Kunden angezeigt, wenn diese eine Suche anhand Ihres Namens, Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer oder eines Teils dieser Angaben durchführen. Dadurch soll sichergestellt werden, dass Zahlungen an den richtigen Empfänger erfolgen. Diese Funktion kann in den PayPal-Profileinstellungen deaktiviert werden.
e. Nutzen Sie als Händler einen Dritten für den Zugriff auf PayPal oder die Integration von PayPal, können wir notwendige Informationen an diesen Dritten zur Umsetzung und Verwaltung der betreffenden Vereinbarungen weitergeben (darunter den Status Ihrer PayPal-Integration, ob Sie ein aktives PayPal-Konto haben und ob Sie bereits mit einem anderen PayPal-Integrationspartner arbeiten).
f. Offenlegung notwendiger Daten gegenüber Zahlungsanbietern, Wirtschaftsprüfern, Kundenservice-Anbietern, Kreditauskunfteien und Betrugsbekämpfungsstellen, Anbietern von Finanzprodukten, Handelspartnern, Marketing- und PR-Unternehmen, Anbietern von operativen Dienstleistungen, Konzerngesellschaften, Agenturen, Marktplätzen und sonstigen Dritten, die
hier
aufgeführt sind. Zweck der Offenlegung ist die Bereitstellung der PayPal-Dienste an Sie. In der Drittanbieterliste haben wir außerdem unter jeder Kategorie nicht abschließende Beispiele von Drittanbietern (einschließlich deren Abtretungsempfängern und Rechtsnachfolgern) aufgeführt, gegenüber denen eine Offenlegung Ihrer Kontoinformationen derzeit tatsächlich stattfindet oder in Betracht gezogen werden kann. Neben dem Zweck der Offenlegung haben wir auch die offengelegten Informationen angegeben (soweit nicht anders angegeben, ist es diesen Drittanbietern gesetzlich bzw. vertraglich untersagt, die Informationen für einen anderen als den vorgesehenen Zweck zu nutzen).
g. Offenlegung erforderlicher Daten gegenüber Ihren Vertretern bzw. Verfahrensbevollmächtigten (z.B. dem Inhaber einer von Ihnen erteilten Vollmacht oder einem für Sie bestellten Vormund).
h. Offenlegung von zusammengefassten Statistikdaten an unsere Geschäftspartner oder PR-Partner. Wir können beispielsweise offenlegen, dass ein bestimmter Prozentsatz unserer Kunden in einer bestimmten Stadt lebt. Diese zusammengefassten Daten enthalten keine personenbezogenen Daten.
i. Weitergabe notwendiger Kontoinformationen an nicht mit uns verbundene (
hier
aufgeführte) Drittanbieter zu folgenden Zwecken:
Betrugsprävention und Risikosteuerung: Prävention von Betrug sowie Bewertung und Steuerung von Risiken.
Kundenservice: zu Zwecken des Kundenservice, einschließlich der Betreuung Ihrer Konten oder zur Klärung von Konflikten (z.B. in Bezug auf Rechnungen oder Transaktionen).
Versand: im Zusammenhang mit dem Versand und darauf bezogenen Dienstleistungen bei Käufen, die mit PayPal getätigt wurden.
Einhaltung gesetzlicher Vorschriften: zur Unterstützung der Verifizierungsanforderungen bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung.
Dienstleister: um die mit uns vertraglich verbundenen Dienstleister in die Lage zu versetzen, uns bei geschäftlichen Vorgängen wie z.B. Betrugsprävention, Inkassomaßnahmen, Marketing, Kundenservice und Technologiedienstleistungen zu unterstützen. Diese Dienstleister werden von uns vertraglich verpflichtet, Ihre Daten nur für die Dienstleistungen zu verwenden, die sie für uns erbringen, nicht jedoch zu ihrem eigenen Nutzen.

Cloudflare Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 28, 2024.
We have updated our July 18, 2024 Privacy Policy to update the contact email of our Data Protection Officer.
This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the personal information that Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we use that personal information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such personal information.
CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE
Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with our Customers, users, and the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.
We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell or rent your personal information. We will only share or otherwise disclose your personal information as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy, except in cases where we first provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.
1. POLICY APPLICATION
This Policy applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of the personal information of the following categories of data subjects:
Attendees
: Those who visit our offices or provide their information to Cloudflare or Cloudflare representatives when they attend or register to attend Cloudflare-sponsored events or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, as well as those who participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Website Visitors
: Those who visit our Websites, including those who may opt to provide an email address or other contact information to receive communications from Cloudflare, fill out a survey, or provide feedback. For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites” refer collectively to
www.cloudflare.com
as well as any other websites Cloudflare operates for its own behalf and that link to this Policy. For clarity, “Websites” does not include any sites owned or operated by our Customers, including where we serve as Registrar.
Customers
: Individuals or entities who enter into a subscription agreement with Cloudflare (or its authorized partner) and to whom Cloudflare provides Services pursuant to such agreement. For purposes of this Policy, “Services” shall refer to all of the cloud-based solutions offered, marketed, or sold by Cloudflare or its authorized partners that are designed to increase the performance, security, and availability of Internet properties, applications, devices, and networks, along with any software, software development kits, and application programming interfaces ("APIs") made available in connection with the foregoing.
Administrative Users
: Those with login credentials for a Cloudflare account and/or those who administer any of the Services for a Customer. In some cases, an Administrative User and Customer may be the same individual. In other cases, an Administrative User may be an agent acting on behalf of a Customer.
Public DNS Resolver Users
: Those who use Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 public recursive Domain Name System (“DNS”) resolver service, including 1.1.1.1 for Families ("1.1.1.1 resolver"). Learn more about the 1.1.1.1 resolver
here
.
End Users
: Those who (i) access or use our Customers’ domains, networks, websites, application programming interfaces, and applications, or (ii) Customers’ employees, agents, or contractors, who access or use Services, such as Cloudflare Zero Trust end users.
Registrants:
Users of Cloudflare’s domain registrar services. Cloudflare is an
ICANN
-accredited registrar and complies with the
2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement
(“RAA”).
This Policy does not apply to “Application Users”—those individuals who use Cloudflare’s consumer-facing 1.1.1.1 Application. See the
1.1.1.1 Application Privacy Policy
for more information about the data collection and use practices for Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Application and the associated 1.1.1.1 Application Services.
This Policy also does not apply to our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, and networks, which may have their own terms and privacy policies. Our Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to the collection of personal information, in connection with the use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.
Cloudflare’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen. Cloudflare does not knowingly collect or share personal information from any person under the age of eighteen. To the extent we become aware that we have the personal information of a person under the age of eighteen, we will delete that information.
When Cloudflare is a reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS records for websites using our Services. We are a conduit for information controlled by others. It is our Customers and their users who are responsible for the content transmitted across our network (e.g., images, written content, graphics, etc.).
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT (Categories of Data Subjects)
Attendees
Name, email address, and other contact information
: We may ask for and collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you visit our offices, register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, or participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Image and voice
: When you participate in a Cloudflare study, we may ask for your permission to record your voice and/or image during your participation in the study.
Website Visitors
Name, email address, and other contact information
: We ask for and—at your option—collect personal information from you when you submit web forms on our Websites, including opportunities to sign up for and agree to receive email communications from us. We may ask you to submit such personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Websites, including participation in surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, or studies, requesting customer support, submitting feedback, or otherwise communicating with us. We will send such communications in accordance with applicable law.
Log files
: Just as when you visit and interact with most websites and services delivered via the Internet, when you visit our Websites, including the Cloudflare Community Forum, we gather certain information and store it in log files. This information may include but is not limited to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, system configuration information, URLs of referring pages, and locale and language preferences.
Cookies and other tracking technologies
: We may use cookies and other information-gathering technologies for a variety of purposes, such as providing us with information about how you interact with our Websites and assisting us in our marketing efforts. You may view a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link (or, in the United States, the “Your Privacy Choices” link) in the footer of the Cloudflare homepage at cloudflare.com or in the banner displayed when you visit our Websites from certain countries (such as the European Economic Area and the UK). Note that if you disable cookies entirely, Cloudflare’s Websites may not function properly. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you advertising on third-party sites based upon your browsing activities and interests. In addition to exercising cookie choices through our “Cookie Preferences” or “Your Privacy Choices” links, if you do not want to have cookies and similar technologies used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking
here
(or if located in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, click
here
). For more information about the cookies Cloudflare uses and your privacy choices, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Material contributed in Interactive Areas
: The Websites may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums, or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”). If you choose to participate in any of these Interactive Areas, please be aware that any information that you post in an Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others who access it. If you wish to remove your personal information from any of our Interactive Areas, please see the Section 8, below.
Customers and Administrative Users
Customer Account Information
: When you register for an account, we collect contact information. Depending on subscription level, this contact information may include your Customer name, the email address(es) of your account administrator(s), telephone number, and addresses necessary to process payment and delivery of Services. In addition, when you use the Services, we collect information about how you configure your account and the Services (e.g., firewall settings for the domains you administer). We refer to all of this information collectively as “Customer Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. Customer Account Information is required to enable your access to your Cloudflare account and Services. By providing us with any personal information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal information or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us. We also maintain logs of Administrative Users’ activity (e.g., actions taken to configure settings in Customers’ account).
Payment information
: We do not require our Customers to have payment information on file with us unless they have a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide payment and billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on which payment method you choose. For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect your card information and billing address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or personal account numbers.
Crash Reports
: When our Services encounter an unexpected error, you may be asked to submit a crash report, which may contain personal information. You will have an opportunity to review the content of the report prior to submitting the report to us.
Public DNS Resolver Users
Limited DNS query data
: We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Our 1.1.1.1 resolver service does not log personal information, and the bulk of the limited non-personally identifiable query data is only stored for 25 hours. You can learn more about our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitment to privacy
here
.
Please note that our data handling practices for our 1.1.1.1 Application, which is not covered by this Policy, are somewhat different than our 1.1.1.1 resolver data handling practices and are described
here
.
End Users
Cloudflare processes End Users’ interactions with Customer’s Internet Properties and the Services. This information is processed when End Users access or use our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, devices, end points, and networks that use one or more of our Services, and when End Users access or use Services, such as Cloudflare Zero Trust. The information processed may include but is not limited to IP addresses, traffic routing data, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to and from Customers’ websites, devices, applications, and/or networks.
The End User data that we make available to our Customers via the Service dashboard or other online interface are specifically defined as “Customer Logs”.
Registrants
Contact and domain information: We collect data such as domain name and status, contact information (such as name, organization, address, phone number and email address), name server, DNSSEC, and Form of Approval (i.e., full WHOIS capture at time of transfer into our system, including the IP address that initiated the transfer).
Network Data.
Cloudflare collects and stores Network Data, which are models, observations, reports, analyses, statistics, databases and other information created, compiled, analyzed, generated or derived by Cloudflare from server, network or traffic data generated by Cloudflare in the course of providing the Service, including information required to help Cloudflare identify, analyze, mitigate, prevent, and block malicious activities on Cloudflare’s network. Examples of Network Data include service uptime and service availability metrics, request volumes, error rates, cache rates, origin and nature of malware, and IP threat scores.
3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Cloudflare only processes personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or authorized. As a general matter, for the categories of data described in Section 2 above, except 1.1.1.1 resolver user data as explained below, we may use your personal information to:
Provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote the Websites and Services for all users of the Websites and Services;
Enable you to access and use the Websites and Services;
Process and complete transactions, and send you related information, including purchase confirmations and invoices;
Send transactional messages, including responses to your comments, questions, and requests; provide customer service and support; and send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
Comply with legal obligations as well as to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to the Services, and other illegal activities;
For other purposes for which we obtain your consent.
In addition, we may use the information we collect from Attendees, Websites Visitors, and Registrants, as well as Customer Account Information for the following purposes:
Send commercial communications, in accordance with your communication preferences, such as providing you with information about products and services, features, surveys, newsletters, offers, promotions, contests, and events about us and our partners; and send other news or information about us and our partners. See Section 9 below for information on managing your communication preferences.
Process and deliver contest or sweepstakes entries and rewards;
Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with the Websites and Services and for marketing or advertising purposes;
Personalize the Websites and Services, including by providing features or content that match your interests and preferences;
To register visitors to our offices and to manage non-disclosure agreements that visitors may be required to sign, to the extent such processing is necessary for our legitimate interest in protecting our offices and our confidential information against unauthorized access; and
Public DNS Resolver Users
. We use information we collect from 1.1.1.1 resolver users to operate and improve the 1.1.1.1 resolver, such as to assist us in our debugging efforts if an issue arises. Our 1.1.1.1 resolver service does not store 1.1.1.1 resolver users’ personal information. We will not combine any information collected from DNS queries to our 1.1.1.1 resolver with any other Cloudflare or third party data in any way that can be used to identify individual end users. Cloudflare may store aggregated data, as outlined within our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitments to privacy, indefinitely in order to power Cloudflare Radar and assist Cloudflare in improving Cloudflare services, such as, enhancing the overall performance of the Cloudflare Resolver and identifying security threats. Learn more about our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitment to privacy
here
.
Information from Third Party Services
. We may combine information we collect as described in Section 2 above with personal information we obtain from third parties. For example, we may combine information entered on a Cloudflare sales submission form with information we receive from a third-party sales intelligence platform vendor to enhance our ability to market our Services to Customers or potential Customers.
4. DATA AGGREGATION
Cloudflare may aggregate data we acquire about our Customers, Administrators, and End Users. For example, we may assemble data to determine how Web crawlers index the Internet and whether they are engaged in malicious activity or to compile web traffic reports and statistics. Non-personally identifiable, aggregated data may be shared with third parties.
5. INFORMATION SHARING
We work with other companies who provide us with services that help run our business and the Cloudflare Service (“Service Providers”). These companies provide services to help us deliver customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact our existing Customers and Administrators as well as sales leads, provide marketing support, and otherwise operate and improve our Services. These Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to our instructions and in compliance both with this Privacy Policy, the contracts we have in place with such Service Providers, and other applicable confidentiality, data protection, and security measures and regulations.
Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to sell any personal information we share with them or to use any personal information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to us.
In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above, we also may share your information with others in the following circumstances:
Within the Cloudflare Group (defined for the purposes of this Policy as Cloudflare, Inc. (United States) and its subsidiaries listed Section 15);
With our resellers and other sales partners who may help us distribute the Services to Customers;
With an app developer when you install an app from our App Marketplace;
In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business;
When we are required to disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. (Learn more about how we handle law enforcement requests
here
);
Where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Website Terms of Use, Self-Serve Subscription Agreement, and/or Enterprise Subscription Terms of Service; or as otherwise required to comply with our legal obligations; or
As you may otherwise consent from time to time.
Additional Information on Sharing
Public DNS Resolver Users.
Cloudflare does not share 1.1.1.1 resolver logs with any third parties except for anonymous logs shared with APNIC pursuant to a Research Cooperative Agreement. Learn more about information sharing specific to the 1.1.1.1 resolver
here
.
Registrants.
If you purchase a domain name from Cloudflare’s registrar service, ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and the relevant registry operators overseeing the domain’s top-level domain require us to collect registrant data for the purposes of domain registration and via the WHOIS protocol. We may also be required to share this public data with ICANN, the relevant registry operators and other such providers with whom we contract in order to provide our domain name services, and additionally upon the legitimate request of third parties. Registrant data may include the domain name, registrant name and other contact information, and domain name server information. See our Domain Registration Agreement
here
.
Marketing & Advertising Partners.
Our marketing and advertising partners may collect or receive personal information about you and/or collect certain information about your interactions with our Websites, or your email communications with Cloudflare, including through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies, in order to gain insights that may help us market and advertise our services to you.  You may opt out of such sharing using our “Cookie Preferences” link (or, in the United States, the “Your Privacy Choices” link) on the cloudflare.com homepage.
In addition, we may also provide these marketing and advertising partners with your email address or other limited account information. You may opt out of such sharing by emailing us at sar@cloudflare.com.
These partners’ use of your information will be based on their own privacy policies. We share this personal information for our business purposes.

6. NOTICE TO EU, UK, AND SWISS RESIDENTS
“Personal information” as referenced in this Privacy Policy means “personal data” as that term is defined under the European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) and its United Kingdom (“UK”) GDPR counterpart. Cloudflare is a data controller for the personal information collected from all categories of data subjects listed above, with the following exceptions: Cloudflare is a data processor of Customer Logs, Administrative User logs, and some account settings information. In addition, Cloudflare is a data processor for any of the content provided by Customers and End Users through the Services that transits, or in some cases, is stored on, the Cloudflare network. Where Cloudflare is a data processor, Cloudflare processes data on behalf of its Customers pursuant to their data processing instructions.
If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the UK or Switzerland, please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We normally will collect personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Cloudflare Services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our legitimate interests. Please note that in most cases, if you do not provide the requested information, Cloudflare will not be able to provide the requested service to you.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object by emailing us at sar@cloudflare.com.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com

7. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS
Cloudflare is a U.S. based, global company. We primarily store your information in the United States and the European Economic Area. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.
Whenever a Cloudflare company transfers personal information originating from one country to another Cloudflare group company or a third party service provider or partner in a different country, we will implement appropriate safeguards, consistent with the laws of the territory from which the data is exported. We describe the safeguards we implement
here
. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK) to the United States, we rely on our certifications under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Should these certifications lapse or become otherwise invalidated, Cloudflare relies on the standard contractual clauses, including supplementary measures as necessary for transfers to the United States. We also use standard contractual clauses for other international transfers from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.
Self-certification to the Data Privacy Framework
Cloudflare complies with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Cloudflare has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Cloudflare has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Cloudflare’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). We may be required to disclose personal information we receive under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Cloudflare is liable for the processing of personal information it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Cloudflare shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Cloudflare proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
8. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES
Cloudflare  recognizes individuals’ data protection rights. You have the right to access, correct, update, port, or delete your personal information, and to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information (each of these a “Rights Request”). You may email us at sar@cloudflare.com with any Rights Request, and we will respond within thirty (30) days. Customers and Administrative Users also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at Cloudflare.com.
Please note that before we can complete your Rights Request, we will need to verify that your identity matches that of the data in which you are requesting to exercise your rights. You can expect a verification email under separate cover, to the email address associated with your personal information on file. If you are making a Rights Request on behalf of another individual as an authorized agent, we require that either (a) the data subject must verify their identity and directly confirm with Cloudflare they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the Rights Request, (b) the authorized agent must be provided power of attorney by the data subject in accordance with the law of the data subject’s jurisdiction, or (c) the Rights Request must otherwise be submitted in accordance with applicable privacy law.
For any Rights Request, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist. Where a Rights Request may implicate the personal information of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply with Rights Requests to the extent required by applicable law or the Swiss-U.S. or EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. In the event that your Rights Request is denied, residents of the U.S. states Virginia and Colorado may appeal our decision by responding to the email informing them of the denial or by submitting a Rights Request to appeal to sar@cloudflare.com, and we will respond within sixty (60) days. In the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Please note that we do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that would be subject to the Rights Requests described above. In addition, Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users. Even where “Cloudflare” may be indicated as the authoritative name server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain, we have no control over a domain’s content. Accordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for Rights Requests in accordance with their obligations under applicable data protection laws. If an End User requests that we fulfill a Rights Request, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly. Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website users.
9. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES
Cloudflare will send you commercial communications based on the communication preferences in your account settings. Cloudflare also will send you service-related communications. You may manage your receipt of commercial communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of such emails, through your account settings if you have a Cloudflare account, or you may send a request to unsubscribe@cloudflare.com.
10. DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS
We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access. We have put in place appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
11. DATA RETENTION
We store your personal information for a period of time that is consistent with the business purposes set forth in Section 3 of this policy or as long as needed to fulfill and comply with legal obligations. The criteria we used to determine how long we store your personal information will vary depending on several different factors. We typically consider the following when determining data retention:
The purpose for collecting the personal information in the first place. For example, if you have an active account with us, we need to keep your contact information during the entirety of that time in order to provide you with support or contact you regarding your account;
The volume, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information we are processing;
The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information;
Whether we can achieve the purposes for processing with less data or through other means
Legal requirements that may apply to the data, such as applicable statutes of limitation or contractual obligations.
When the data retention period expires for a given type of data, we will delete or destroy it. If, for technical reasons, we are unable to do so, we will implement appropriate security measures to prevent any further use of such data.
12. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
If we make changes to this Policy that we believe materially impact the privacy of your personal information, we will promptly provide notice of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), as well as post the updated Policy on this website noting the effective date of any changes.
13. BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS
We may assign or transfer this Policy, as well as information covered by this Policy, in the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.
14. ENGLISH LANGUAGE CONTROLS
Non-English translations of this Policy are provided for convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.
15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
If you have an unresolved privacy or data-use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request

16. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section, “Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in the CCPA. It does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.
How We Collect, Use, and Share Your Personal Information under the CCPA
We may collect, use, and disclose for our business and commercial purposes, the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers for the categories of individuals/users defined in Section 1 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy (e.g., email address of Customers and Administrative Users, name and contact information of Attendees);
Payment and customer records information of our Customers;
Protected classification characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, race, languages spoken, or gender) to the extent these characteristics are voluntarily disclosed to us or contained in any  content transmitted across or stored on our network;
Commercial information (e.g., records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or usage histories);
Professional or employment information;
Internet or other electronic network activity information; and
Inferences (e.g., information about your interests or preferences).
The sources from which we collect information are described in Section 2 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The business and commercial purposes for which we collect and use this information are described in Section 3 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The categories of third parties to whom we “disclose” the information for a business purpose are described in Section 5 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
Your California Privacy Rights
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.
Knowledge
. You can request information about what personal information we have collected about you, including:
the categories of personal information;
the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information;
the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.
Access
. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you.
Deletion
. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.
Correction
. You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal information and, taking into account the purpose of processing the personal information, ensure it is complete;
Opt-out of sales or sharing
. You can ask that we do not “sell” or “share” your Personal Information as “sell” and “share” are explicitly defined under the CCPA. For more information, please refer to the section titled “Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information” below.
Nondiscrimination
. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you the Services; increasing the price/rate of the Services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.
In order to submit a request to exercise your right of information, access, or deletion pursuant to the CCPA, please follow the instructions for the submitting a Rights Request detailed in Section 8, above. Please note, we reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and may need to confirm your identity to process certain requests using the verification methods described in Section 8. For example, we take reasonable precautions to verify the identities of those California residents submitting requests to delete or access Personal Information.
Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information
Cloudflare does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use. Making Personal Information (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information under the CCPA.
You can request to opt out of such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information using the “
Your Privacy Choices”
link in the footer below
.
In addition, some internet browsers offer the option to enable opt-out signals such as Global Privacy Control that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Cloudflare responds to these signals by processing them as a request to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information as discussed above.
Please note that you will still see some advertising, regardless of your selection. We do not impose verification protocols for processing opt out requests unless we have reason to question the authenticity of a requester’s identity, in which case we may request evidence of identity and California residency.

Sub-policy 7
https://automattic.com/privacy:
Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles:
We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.
Who We Are and What This Policy Covers
Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone — from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises — to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (“GPL”). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.
This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:
Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, atavist.com, mailpoet.com, automatewoo.com, jetpackcrm.com, happy.tools, wpcourses.com, wpscan.com, newspack.pub, and wp.cloud);
Our mobile applications (including the WordPress mobile app for Android and iOS);
Our other Automattic products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites (for example, WordPress.com plans, the Payments feature, the Pay with PayPal block, WordPress.com, Jetpack, Woo Shipping, Woo Tax, Gravatar, the IntenseDebate comment management system, Akismet plans, Simplenote, Simperium, Cloudup, Longreads, MailPoet, AutomateWoo, Jetpack CRM, Happy Tools, WordPress.com Courses, WPScan and Newspack); and
Other users’ websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us.
This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Automattic or one of our subsidiaries.
Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” And if you’d like to learn more about which Automattic company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on
Controllers and Responsible Companies
.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services, like Tumblr, that have a separate privacy policy.
Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.
Creative Commons Sharealike License
We’ve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a
Creative Commons Sharealike
license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on
GitHub
. You’re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we’d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.
Information We Collect
We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.
Information You Provide to Us
It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
Basic account information:
We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name — and that’s it. You may provide us with more information — like your address and other information you want to share — but we don’t require that information to create a WordPress.com account.
Public profile information:
If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
Payment and contact information:
There are various ways in which you may provide us payment information and associated contact information. For example, if you buy something from us or earn revenue through your site, we’ll collect information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us — a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a
custom domain
, some Longreads swag — or if you pay fees to a person or business through their WordPress.com site (for example via the Payments feature or the Pay with PayPal block), you’ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made. If you use our Ecommerce Services (including Woo Shipping, Woo Tax, and WooPayments), you’ll have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some Services, provide your site URL. You may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information. Additionally, if you use
WooPay
to make purchases on other sites, we will store the contact information and payment information you provide to that service. And if you participate in a revenue sharing opportunity for your site, like
WordAds
, you’ll provide some additional information — for example, a tax ID or other identifier so we can process payments to you.
Business Profile:
Some of our products collect additional information from you as part of creating a user/customer profile. For example, if you are a Jetpack CRM customer we may add you to our customer relationship database (powered by Jetpack CRM!) using information you provide us including your name, your employer, your job title or role, your contact information, and your communications with us. If you are a Happy Tools user, we use information you provide us like your timezone and location information, your company and team information, and your contact information, to set up your account and power the Service’s features.
Content information:
You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).
Credentials:
Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly.
Communications with us (hi there!):
You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).
Job applicant information:
If you apply for a job with us — awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, professional or personal references, similar professional and employment-related data, and work authorization verification as part of the application process. We may also collect additional information about you during the process, like background and credit checks (in applicable jurisdictions and only for certain job roles).  You may also provide us with demographic information when required by law or to support our diverse workplace initiatives, such as your gender, racial or ethnic origin, veteran status, and disability status if you voluntarily submit such information as part of your application. We collect demographic information in accordance with applicable law, and do not request demographic information in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited. We will only use this sensitive information to accommodate a disability or illness, comply with legal obligations, protect the health and safety of our employees, and facilitate our internal programs relating to diversity, inclusion, and anti-discrimination.
Information We Collect Automatically
We also collect some information automatically:
Log information:
Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.
Transactional information:
When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction. This includes when you purchase something we sell or when you use our Services (like
WooPay
) to buy something from a third party.
Usage information:
We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted “[title of post]” at [time/date]). Our
WooCommerce Usage Tracker
also tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, and PHP settings, along with information about your online store, like the aggregate number of orders and customers. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our
Admin Bar
and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.
Location information:
We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.
Stored information:
We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.
Interactions with other users’ sites:
We collect some information about your interactions with other users’ sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your “Likes” and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example,
recommend posts
we think may interest you. As another example, we collect information about the comments IntenseDebate users make while logged in and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and display information about your comments in your IntenseDebate public profile.
Information from cookies & other technologies:
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Information We Collect from Other Sources
We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:
Third Party Login:
If you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) we’ll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address)
Social Sharing Services:
If you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our
Publicize feature
, we’ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.
Financial Account Info
:
If you use WooPayments, we’ll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number. If you use WooPay, we’ll receive your payment information from Stripe.
Google Account Information:
When you connect your Google account to your Newspack powered site, we may access certain Google user data such as your Google Ad Manager Configuration (the network code and your ad units) and your Google Analytics data to allow you to access and manage features more seamlessly. For example, you may be able to manage your Google ads and see your Google Analytics data directly within the dashboard of your Newspack powered site.
The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.
Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.
How and Why We Use Information
Purposes for Using Information
We use information about you for the purposes listed below:
To provide our Services.
For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.
To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.
For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
To place and manage ads in our advertising program.
For example, to place ads on our users’ sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.
To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.
For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.
To protect our Services, our users, and the public.
For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
To fix problems with our Services.
For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
To customize the user experience.
For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.
To communicate with you.
For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Automattic; texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)
To recruit and hire new Automatticians.
For example, by evaluating job applicants (including verifying their identity, experience, and other information submitted) and communicating with them by phone, email, or social media platforms.  If the application progresses, we may also collect interview information and background check information.  This may also include verifying information required to initiate employment, for purposes such as confirming ability to legally work in a specific location, setting up payroll, and complying with statutory reporting requirements.
Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:
(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or
(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or
(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or
(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or
(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our
Cookie Policy
.
Sharing Information
How We Share Information
We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below, as well as in the section called
Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others
:
Subsidiaries and independent contractors:
We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.
Third-party vendors:
We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which powers WooPayments, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your own ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic); those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites (like the extensions on woocommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our
Cookie Policy
).
Legal and regulatory requirements:
We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our
Legal Guidelines
. Additionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers’ (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our
Domain Registrations and Privacy support document
for more details.
To protect rights, property, and others:
We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we
may disclose information related to the emergency without delay
.
Business transfers:
In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
With your consent:
We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.
Aggregated or de-identified information:
We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
Site owners:
If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with another site using our Services, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site. For example, if you leave a comment on a site created on WordPress.com or running Jetpack, your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment. Or if you make a payment (like via the
Payments feature
) to a site, your public display name, user name, and email address may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site. Or if you follow/subscribe to another WordPress.com site we will share your email address with the site owner.
Published support requests:
If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.
Information Shared Publicly
Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly.
That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your “Likes” and comments on other websites are all available to others — and we hope they get a lot of views!
For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven’t uploaded one, is your
G
lobally
R
ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar — get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and “Likes” that you make on other users’ websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Your Gravatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, “Likes,” and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account is the same email address you use on the other website.
We also provide a “Firehose” stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly. Find out more about opting out of the Firehose for
WordPress.com
and
Jetpack
sites. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.
How Long We Keep Information
We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it.
For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic’s websites, like the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automattic’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.
As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.
If you are a job applicant, we will keep your personal data during the application process, and for a certain period thereafter. To determine that period, we take into account a number of factors, like our legal and regulatory obligations (such as equal opportunity obligations) and whether we may need to retain personal data for internal business purposes like analyzing our applicant pool.
Security
While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like
Two Step Authentication
.
Choices
You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:
Limit the information that you provide:
If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services — for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge — may not be accessible. If you are a job applicant, and you choose not to provide certain data elements to us, we may not be able to proceed with the recruitment process.
Limit access to information on your mobile device:
Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for photographs.
Opt out of marketing communications:
You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
Set your browser to reject cookies:
At this time, Automattic does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can
usually choose
to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Opt out of our internal analytics program:
You can do this through your user settings. By opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you’re logged in to your WordPress.com account. For more information, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Close your account:
While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. (
Here
are account closure instructions for WordPress.com accounts.) Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
Your Rights
If you are located in certain parts of the world, including some US states and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:
Request access to your personal data;
Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
Request portability of your personal data.
You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.
US Privacy Laws
Laws in some US states require us to provide residents with additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. You’ll find that information in this section (if you are a California resident, please note that this is the Notice at Collection we are required to provide you under California law).
In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information, depending on the Services used:
Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us or you may choose to voluntarily disclose your race or veteran status as part of your job application);
Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);
Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application); and
Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).
If you are a job applicant, we may have also collected:
Education information, such as the education you disclose in your job application.
You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the
Information We Collect section
above.
We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the
How and Why We Use Information section
. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the
Sharing Information section
. We retain this information for the length of time described in our
How Long We Keep Information section
.
In some US states you have additional rights subject to any exemptions provided by your state’s respective law, including the right to:
Request a copy of the specific pieces of information we collect about you and, if you’re in California, to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, and the categories of third parties we share it with;
Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
Request correction of personal information we collect or maintain;
Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information;
Receive a copy of your information in a readily portable format; and
Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights.
You can find detailed metrics about Automattic’s compliance with these rights in
our Privacy Report
.
Right to Opt Out
We never directly sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).
We may share your information as necessary with our third-party service providers to provide our services to you. To the extent that we share your information with certain advertising, marketing, or analytics vendors, this can be considered a “sale” or “share” in certain U.S. States, which you may have the right to opt out of.
You can learn more about this sharing and how to opt out by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link in the footer of our websites, or from the settings page within our apps. Note that in some instances this link will only display to individuals visiting our sites from within the relevant states.
Our opt-out is managed through cookies, so if you delete cookies, your browser is set to delete cookies automatically after a certain length of time, or if you visit sites in a different browser, you’ll need to make this selection again.
We also respect the GPC browser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire to opt out.
We do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive) personal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with our service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option to limit under California law. We don’t knowingly sell or share personal information of those under 16.
Your Information & Personalized Advertising
Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible. We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites. As part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users’ sites and some of our own.
The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a “sale” or “share” of information under some US state privacy laws. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information. Learn how you can opt out by going to
Advertising on WordPress.com Sites and Sites in the WordAds Program
.
Contacting Us About These Rights
You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to “
How to Reach Us
” to, well, find out how to reach us.
When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.
Appeals Process for Rights Requests Denials
In some circumstances we may deny your request to exercise one of these rights. For example, if we cannot verify that you are the account owner we may deny your request to access the personal information associated with your account. As another example, if we are legally required to maintain a copy of your personal information we may deny your request to delete your personal information.
In the event that we deny your request, we will communicate this fact to you in writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial email and stating that you would like to appeal. All appeals will be reviewed by an internal expert who was not involved in your original request. In the event that your appeal is also denied this information will be communicated to you in writing.  Please note that the appeal process does not apply to job applicants.
If your appeal is denied, in some US states you may refer the denied appeal to the state attorney general if you believe the denial is in conflict with your legal rights. The process for how to do this will be communicated to you in writing at the same time we send you our decision about your appeal.
Controllers and Responsible Companies
Automattic’s Services are worldwide. Different Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.
Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data. Generally, the “controller” is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you under the Terms of Service for the product or service you use. In addition, Automattic Inc., our US-based company, is the controller for some of the processing activities across all of our Services worldwide.
The chart below explains the current controllers for processing your personal information. We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and all countries located in Europe (including the UK and ROI).

Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)
Transferring Information
Because Automattic’s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third-party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the
How and Why We Use Information section
above.
When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with entities based in countries outside the EEA.
You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.
Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others
Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver ads that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Automattic and does not cover the collection of information by any third-party advertisers or analytics providers.
Third-Party Software and Services
If you’d like to use third-party plugins or embeds, WooPayments (powered by Stripe), Woo extensions that enable services provided by third parties, or other third-party software or services, please keep in mind that interacting with them may mean providing information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties. For example, some third-party services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data via a pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third-party service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy and practices. We don’t own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about information collection, use, and sharing, which you should review before using the software or services.
Visitors to Our Users’ Websites
We also process information about visitors to our users’ websites, on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for their websites isn’t covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information. If you’d like, you can also read more about the data we collect on behalf of our users in our
Privacy Notice
.
Users control the content posted on their sites, so any disputes regarding content on a user’s site should be made directly to the site owner, through their “contact us” page, at an email address they provide, or by leaving a comment on the site.
Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Automattic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Automattic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our homepage or the
WordPress.com Blog,
or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.

If you have opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we will need to retain certain Personal Data on a suppression list indefinitely so that we know not to send you further marketing communications in the future.

Further information about this will be provided during the application process and we will ask for consent where necessary according to local law.
The above examples may vary in some cases due to local laws, liability periods and mandatory retention requirements. For example, if certain information needs to be retained for longer according to local laws, regulations or because different legal limitation periods apply, then we will keep the Personal Data for these longer periods.

Sofern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auf der Basis eines berechtigten Interesses verarbeiten, geschieht dies nur, soweit die Verarbeitung relevant, angemessen und auf die für den Erfassungszweck notwendigen Daten beschränkt ist.

Dazu können Sie sich entweder der innerhalb des jeweiligen Produkts bereitgestellten Funktion bedienen oder indem Sie uns kontaktieren (siehe Abschnitt „Kontaktaufnahme“ weiter unten). Bitte beachten Sie jedoch, dass wir unter Umständen berechtigt sind, Ihre Daten weiterhin zu verarbeiten, wenn dies laut einer der anderen oben genannten Rechtsgrundlagen zulässig ist.

Ihre öffentlichen personenbezogenen Daten auf Trustpilot (sowohl für Bewerter als auch für Business-Nutzer)
Wir teilen Ihre öffentlichen personenbezogenen Daten auf unserem Portal, damit andere lesen können, welche Erfahrungen Sie mit einem bestimmten Unternehmen gemacht haben. Wenn Sie Ihren richtigen Namen als Nutzernamen verwenden, denken Sie bitte daran, dass dies Ihre Identität auf unserer öffentlichen Website preisgeben kann. In diesem Artikel in unserem Hilfecenter finden Sie weitere Informationen zu Ihren öffentlichen personenbezogenen Daten.
Wenn Sie als Business-Nutzer Informationen in Ihr öffentliches Trustpilot-Profil integrieren, gelten diese Informationen als öffentliche personenbezogene Daten und sind für jeden Besucher der Trustpilot-Website zugänglich.
Ihre privaten personenbezogenen Daten auf Trustpilot (sowohl für Bewerter als auch für Business-Nutzer)
Einige Trustpilot-Mitarbeiter haben Zugriff auf Ihre Daten, um alle im Abschnitt „Wie und warum wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verwenden“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie aufgeführten Punkte zu erleichtern. Trustpilot handelt jedoch auf der Grundlage von Prinzipien, nach denen der Datenzugriff auf Personen beschränkt ist, die einen echten arbeitsbezogenen Bedarf haben.
Wenn Sie Verbraucher sind und von einem unserer Business-Kunden über unser Portal eine Bewertungseinladung erhalten haben, hat dieser über seinen Trustpilot-Business-Account Zugriff auf Ihre Daten. Wenn Sie auf Trustpilot eine Bewertung in Erwiderung auf eine Einladung abgeben, die von einem Unternehmen über unsere Dienste für Bewertungseinladungen gesendet wurde, kann dieses Unternehmen Ihre Bewertung der betreffenden Einladung zuordnen. Nochmals zur Erinnerung: Unsere Business-Kunden sind die Datenverantwortlichen für diese Daten und Sie sollten sich bei Fragen an sie wenden.
Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, die an unabhängige Drittanbieter, Websites und Unternehmen weitergegeben werden
Eines der Hauptziele von Trustpilot ist es, die globale Sichtbarkeit, Verfügbarkeit und den Nutzen von Bewertungen und damit in Zusammenhang stehenden Inhalten zu maximieren. Deshalb gestatten wir verschiedenen unabhängigen Dritten den Zugriff auf öffentliche personenbezogene Daten, unter anderem auf Nutzernamen, Informationen aus Nutzerprofilen, Bewertungsinhalte und Antworten auf Bewertungen von Unternehmen (wie im Abschnitt „Welche personenbezogenen Daten wir erfassen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie näher erläutert), über Programmierschnittstellen und andere Übertragungsmethoden für programmatische Daten, die über unser Portal verfügbar sind, sowie die Nutzung und Einbindung dieser öffentlichen personenbezogenen Daten in ihre eigenen Produkte und Dienstleistungen. Dies vergrößert das potenzielle Zielpublikum und den Informationsstand von Verbrauchern und Unternehmen über Trustpilot und Verbraucherbewertungen sowie die wertvollen Erkenntnisse, die sie liefern. Wir stellen solchen Dritten öffentliche personenbezogene Daten nur dann auf diese Weise zur Verfügung, wenn sie den Bedingungen der Datenlizenz zustimmen, die einen angemessenen Schutz der Daten und der Rechte der betroffenen Personen gewährleisten. Informationen zur Ablehnung bestimmter Teile dieser Datenweitergabe finden Sie weiter unten im Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte“.
Zu den Dritten, die auf solche öffentlichen personenbezogenen Daten zugreifen, diese verwenden und einbinden dürfen, gehören:
Suchmaschinen und andere Schnittstellen, die Informationen als Antwort auf Nutzeranfragen bereitstellen (einschließlich KI-gestützte Systeme);
Unternehmen, zu denen Sie eine Produkt- oder Servicebewertung auf Trustpilot abgegeben haben, entweder auf Einladung oder unaufgefordert;
Online-Plattformen, auf denen es nach Einschätzung von Trustpilot für Nutzer hilfreich oder relevant wäre, nach Bewertungen und damit verbundenen Inhalten zu suchen und auf diese zuzugreifen, unter anderem Verbraucher- und Unternehmensportale wie Preisvergleichswebsites und Einkaufsratgeber;
Anwendungspartner und -plattformen, wie beispielsweise PrestaShop, Magento, Shopify und WooCommerce;
Soziale Netzwerke; und
alle anderen Dritten, die eine Lizenzvereinbarung mit Trustpilot abschließen, um auf öffentliche personenbezogene Daten zuzugreifen.
Wenn Sie sich dafür entscheiden, auf die Informationsanfrage eines bewerteten Unternehmens zu antworten (z. B. über unser
Tool „Informationen anfragen“
), werden Ihre Angaben direkt an das Unternehmen gesendet, das die Informationen angefordert hat. Manchmal müssen wir Sie
um Nachweise bitten
, um Ihre Erfahrung zu verifizieren. Zum Beispiel, wenn unsere spezalisierte Software Ihre Bewertung meldet und aus dem Trustpilot-Portal entfernt. Wir werden diese Nachweise niemals an das bewertete Unternehmen weitergeben, übermitteln unter bestimmten Umständen aber möglicherweise eine Referenznummer, eine Bestellnummer oder Ähnliches an das Unternehmen, es sei denn, Sie teilen uns mit, dass Sie dies nicht wünschen.
Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, die an Auftragsverarbeiter weitergegeben werden
Wir geben Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an ausgewählte Dritte weiter (dazu gehören z. B. die Tochterunternehmen von Trustpilot und andere Unternehmen innerhalb der Trustpilot-Gruppe sowie sonstige Unternehmen, mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten, um unsere Dienstleistungen zu erbringen), die verschiedene Dienste für uns leisten und damit den technischen Betrieb unseres Portals und die Bereitstellung unserer Dienste unterstützen („Auftragsverarbeiter“). Diese Dritten sind Auftragsverarbeiter der personenbezogenen Daten, für die wir Verantwortlicher sind. Wir haben mit diesen Auftragsverarbeitern jeweils eine Vereinbarung zur Auftragsverarbeitung abgeschlossen, wonach die Auftragsverarbeiter ausschließlich gemäß unseren Anweisungen handeln dürfen. Wir können diesen Auftragsverarbeitern Anweisungen zur Verarbeitung von Daten gemäß der Datenschutzerklärung und für den Zweck der Nutzung des Portals zu erteilen.
Wir unterziehen alle Auftragsverarbeiter einer eingehenden Prüfung, um sicherzustellen, dass diese Auftragsverarbeiter angemessene technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen getroffen haben, damit Daten nicht versehentlich oder entgegen den Vorschriften vernichtet werden, verloren gehen, beschädigt, gegenüber unbefugten Personen offengelegt, missbraucht oder auf andere Weise verarbeitet werden, die eine Verletzung der Datenschutzgesetze darstellt.
Manche dieser Auftragsverarbeiter und Drittanbieter sind außerhalb Ihres Wohnsitzlandes ansässig und unterliegen unter Umständen abweichenden oder weniger strikten Datenschutzanforderungen. Vorbehaltlich der in diesen Ländern geltenden Gesetze stellen wir jedoch sicher, dass Ihre Daten standortunabhängig durch entsprechende Sicherheitsmaßnahmen geschützt werden. Dies erreichen wir durch eine Kombination von angemessenen technischen, organisatorischen und administrativen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen und den Abschluss entsprechender Verträge, um diese Anforderungen zu untermauern. Beispielsweise übermitteln wir personenbezogene Daten europäischer Nutzer nur dann in Länder außerhalb des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums, sofern dort eine von der Europäischen Kommission genehmigte Methode zur Validierung der Übermittlung vorgeschrieben ist.
Sonstige Offenlegungen
Zusätzlich zu den vorgenannten Fällen geben wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an folgende Dritte und unter folgenden Umständen weiter:
um gesetzliche Vorschriften einzuhalten oder auf Klagen und Gerichtsverfahren (wie u. a. Vorladungen oder Gerichtsbeschlüsse) oder Aufforderungen öffentlicher und staatlicher Behörden zu reagieren,
um mit aufsichtsrechtlichen und staatlichen Behörden im Zusammenhang mit Untersuchungen oder verwiesenen Verfahren zu kooperieren,
an Dritte in Verbindung mit der Durchsetzung unserer
Nutzungsbedingungen für Verbraucher
, unserer
Richtlinien für Bewerter
, unserer
Terms of Use and Sale for Businesses
sowie unserer
Richtlinien für Unternehmen
.
an Dritte, um unseren Geschäftsbetrieb bzw. den unserer verbundenen Unternehmen zu schützen,
an Dritte, um unsere Rechte, Privatsphäre, Sicherheit oder unser Eigentum und/oder die Rechte, Privatsphäre, Sicherheit oder das Eigentum unserer verbundenen Unternehmen, von Ihnen oder anderen zu schützen,
an Dritte, um uns zur Verfügung stehende Rechtsmittel in Anspruch zu nehmen oder uns entstandene Schäden einzugrenzen,
an Dritte, damit wir mutmaßliche oder tatsächliche verbotene Handlungen, wie u. a. Betrug oder Missbrauch unseres Portals, untersuchen, diesen vorbeugen oder diesbezüglich Maßnahmen ergreifen können,
an Dritte im Falle von Umstrukturierungen, Fusionen, Übernahmen, Verkäufen, Joint Ventures, Abtretungen, Übertragungen oder sonstigen Veräußerungen des gesamten oder Teilen unseres Geschäfts bzw. unserer Vermögenswerte (wie auch in Verbindung mit etwaigen Insolvenz- oder ähnlichen Verfahren).
Wir bewahren Ihre Daten nur so lange auf, wie wir diese benötigen oder gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind. Dies hängt davon ab, aus welchem Grund die betreffenden Daten erfasst wurden und ob dazu für uns eine fortdauernde Rechtsgrundlage besteht (z. B. um einen mit Ihnen bestehenden Vertrag zu erfüllen, eine von Ihnen erbetene Leistung zu erbringen, gesetzlichen Vorschriften nachzukommen oder für berechtigte Interessen unsererseits). Wenn wir keinen triftigen Grund mehr haben, Ihre Daten weiterhin aufzubewahren, werden die Daten von uns entweder gelöscht oder anonymisiert, sodass Sie anhand der Daten nicht mehr identifizierbar sind. Je nach Verwendungszweck handhaben wir gewisse Daten unterschiedlich. Sie können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten jedoch jederzeit löschen oder uns darum bitten, diese Daten für Sie zu löschen (weitere Informationen dazu finden Sie weiter unten im Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte“).
Wir bewahren die von Ihnen bereitgestellten personenbezogenen Daten, einschließlich Ihrer Bewertungen, so lange auf, wie Sie einen Trustpilot-Account haben oder wie es erforderlich ist, um Ihnen unsere Dienste bereitzustellen. In manchen Fällen bewahren wir bestimmte Daten auch nach Löschung Ihres Trustpilot-Accounts weiterhin auf, wenn wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind oder ein berechtigtes Interesse daran haben, diese Daten aufzubewahren. Zu den Gründen für eine längere Aufbewahrung bestimmter Daten zählen u. a. Sicherheit, Verhinderung von Betrug und Missbrauch unseres Portals, die Einhaltung gesetzlicher oder aufsichtsrechtlicher Vorschriften und die Verteidigung unserer berechtigten Geschäftsinteressen.
Der Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten hat höchste Priorität für uns. Wir setzen verschiedene organisatorische, technische und administrative Maßnahmen zum Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten innerhalb unseres Unternehmens ein und überprüfen unsere Systeme regelmäßig auf Schwachstellen. Allerdings können wir, da das Internet kein vollkommen sicheres Umfeld darstellt, die Sicherheit der Daten, die Sie an uns übermitteln, nicht gewährleisten oder garantieren. Über das Portal versandte E-Mails sind ggf. nicht verschlüsselt und wir empfehlen Ihnen daher, in Ihren E-Mails keine vertraulichen Informationen an uns zu senden.
Wir arbeiten beständig an der Verbesserung
unserer Sicherheitsmaßnahmen und Richtlinien
und werden diese Informationen bei Neuerungen kontinuierlich aktualisieren.
Wir setzen Cookies und ähnliche Technologien ein, um unsere Dienstleistungen bereitzustellen, zu optimieren, zu personalisieren und zu analysieren sowie auch für Werbezwecke.

Introduction and Background
OneSignal, Inc. is a U.S. company located at 201 S. B Street, San Mateo, CA     94401 (“OneSignal” “we,” “us,” and “our”).
OneSignal is a customer engagement platform for companies around the world     to enable their relationships with (and communicate with) their customers.     This is primarily done by leveraging first party data (the company’s data on     their customers) to personalize and automate messaging by the company     through various channels, such as email, SMS, mobile push notifications, web     push notifications, and in-app messaging.
OneSignal collects this first party data through a software development kit     (“
SDKs
”) that companies use in their mobile applications and websites. These web     and mobile SDKs permit app developers and website operators to send, manage,     optimize and customize messages to their customers and users. All of our     services are referred to collectively as our “
Services,
” and the app developers, website operators, business customers, partners     and advertisers are referred to collectively as our “
Clients.
”
This privacy policy (the “
Privacy Policy
”) explains our personal information practices regarding:
Our Client’s end users and customers (“
Client End Users
”),
Our Clients’, partners’, and vendors’ business representatives (e.g., their     employees), and
Users of our website(s), including any website on which this Privacy Policy     is posted, which we separately describe in Section 4,
below
.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party sites or hosted     services you may find or access through our website. This Privacy Policy     also does not apply to our Client’s data practices.  If you submit     personal information to any of those sites or services or to our Clients,     your information will be governed by their privacy policies. We encourage     you to carefully read the privacy policy of any site you visit or hosted     service you use.
Personal Information
References to “personal information” in this Privacy Policy mean     information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of     being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or     indirectly, to an individual or household.
Data Controller or Data Processor
OneSignal is primarily a data processor (or service provider) in relation     to the Services we provide to our Clients, such as when a Client deploys our     technology in order to collect, process or transfer their first party data.     In some cases we operate as a data controller (or business) when we process     personal information of our business contacts, employees, and     representatives.
1. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy     or any portion thereof. Any changes will be effective from the time of     publication of the new privacy policy. Your continued use of the Services     after the changes have been implemented shall indicate your agreement with     the terms of such revised privacy policy. Otherwise, and if the new privacy     policy does not suit you, you must no longer use the Services. Where     required by law we will notify you and/or obtain your     consent.
2. Contacting Us
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact our     Data Protection Officer at
Privacy@OneSignal.com
or at 201 S. B Street, Suite 200 San Mateo, CA 94401.
3. Our Data Practices on our SDKs
Categories of Information Collected About Client End Users by Our Web       SDKs
Identifiers such as:
IP address
Email address, if provided to us
A unique cookie identifier, which may uniquely identify a Client End       User
Commercial information that we receive from our Clients or from our Clients’     use of our Services, such as:
Information about Client End User’s transactions and interactions with       apps and websites
What push notifications have been sent to a Client End User
Internet or other electronic network information activity information, such     as:
Information about a Client End User’s browser, such as browser language       type and version of operating system (e.g., Android, iOS); network       provider; language setting; time zone
Web pages visited that have implemented the SDK, and information about       those visits (e.g., session duration, time-stamp, referring URLs)
Geolocation data inferred from IP address
Sensitive information provided or made available by our Clients
Categories of Information Collected About Client End Users by Our Mobile       SDKs
Identifiers such as:
IP address
Email address, if provided to us
Mobile device or account identifiers which may be associated with other       information, including inference data that Clients create on Client End       Users
Commercial information that we receive from our Clients or from our Clients’     use of our Services, such as:
Purchases made within an app
Information about Client End User’s transactions and interactions with the       app
Internet or other electronic network information activity information, such     as:
Information associated with or related to devices, such as device type       (e.g., mobile, tablet); type and version of operating system (e.g.,       Android, iOS); network provider; mobile browser (e.g. Safari, Chrome,       etc.); language setting; time zone; and network status type (such as       WiFi)
How a user has used the App (e.g., session duration, time-stamp)
Geolocation data inferred from IP address
Precise Location information, generally a Client End User’s lat/long data       (i.e., GPS-level data) or WiFi information, which we may associate with       Mobile IDs, and which may be collected whether or not an app is in use.       (Location information is only collected the user has granted permission to       the App to collect this, and the app chooses to send this data to       OneSignal)
Sensitive information provided or made available by our Clients
Sensitive Information
We generally ask our Clients not to provide us with any sensitive     information of the Client End Users. However, if they do provide us with     sensitive information, then as a service provider to our Clients, we rely on     our Clients to obtain consent (if required by applicable law) or provide opt     out rights (if required by law) and to provide all rights to individuals as     are required by applicable law, contract, or otherwise. Where applicable and     required by law, we may enter into U.S. business associate agreements with     our Clients for the processing of protected health     information.
We refer to all of the above collectively as the “
SDK Information .”Sources of SDK Information
The categories of sources of the SDK Information include the     following:
Information provided by our Clients
Information automatically collected from our Clients’ use of the     Services
How We Use the SDK Information
We use the SDK Information on behalf of our Clients for the purpose of     providing the Services to our Clients. This includes:
To offer and support app and website features provided through the SDKs,     including those related to push notifications. This includes, for instance,     providing customer, technical and operational support for these features,     detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity;     resolving disputes and enforcing our legal terms and other rights we may     have. It also includes analyzing, customizing, and improving the features we     offer Clients.
To provide information and analytics to our Clients about the use of these     app and website features provided through the SDKs, or to help Clients     create or enhance user profiles of Client End Users.
To enable Clients to create inferences about Client End Users. For instance,     if SDK Information indicates that a particular device is frequently seen at     restaurants, we might categorize a user for targeting of local restaurant     offers. Or, if a user is frequently seen at sports stadiums, we might     categorize the user as a “Sports Fan.”
To develop and use “predictive models” which are data models that try to     predict Client End Users’ potential future behavior and interests on a     per-device basis or across devices.
To analyze ad performance, for instance, by attributing Client End Users’     app installations, web visits, or store visits to ad campaigns.
Sometimes, the SDK Information may be used to resolve identities across     multiple devices, such as to match IP addresses or hashed emails to link a     Client End User across (for instance) browsers, mobile devices, tablets, set     top boxes, or other devices.
Sometimes the SDK Information may be used to perform any of the above     functions, or other marketing or analytics services. Or, we may aggregate     and create data “models” to do this – creating algorithms in order to     predict certain trends and things that different Client End Users might have     in common.
We may deploy online cookies to track users across websites, or to     associate users (and these cookies) with Mobile IDs. We may do this to     resolve user identifies across platforms, and to better or more accurately     target messages. You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies,     such as web beacons and SDKs, in the Section titled “
Cookies, Pixel Tags and
SDKs
.”
We may also use the SDK Information for the following purposes:
To explore a potential acquisition or sale of our business
To prevent or stop activity that we may think is illegal; to protect our     rights, privacy, safety or property, and that of you and others; to protect     the security of our services or website; to comply with applicable law; to     comply with legal process and our legal obligations; to respond to requests     or requirements from public, law and government authorities and private     parties; to enforce our terms; to allow us to pursue available remedies or     limit potential damages; and to exercise or defend legal claims
In other ways with your consent or at your direction

For instance, we may disclose certain of the     information we collect or receive to companies that help us with billing and     payment, marketing, advertising and email marketing, data enhancement (e.g.,     to provide more relevant offers), website hosting, technology and customer     support, web and marketing analytics, anti-fraud or security operations, and     other operational, marketing or business support.

We may create deidentified information as part of providing our Services. We     commit to maintain and use deidentified information in deidentified form     only and we will not attempt to reidentify the information, except we may     attempt to reidentify the information solely for the purpose of determining     whether our deidentification process satisfies our commitment above.
We do not engage in profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal     or similarly significant effects concerning you.
5. Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs
Cookies and Pixel Tags.
Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such     as an anonymous unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your     computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your device or     browser. Our servers may send your device a cookie when you visit the     OneSignal Websites, and our Clients and partners may do likewise on our     OneSignal Websites, our Clients’ websites, and elsewhere. A pixel tag (also     commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel     that is placed on certain web pages. When you access web pages on which a     pixel tag is deployed, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the     visit and permit OneSignal, our Clients or partners to set or read cookies.     Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to anonymously track the     activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device. If you     disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit.     OneSignal, alone or with our Clients and partners, may use cookies to, among     other things, “remember” you (e.g., when you visit the OneSignal Websites or     the websites of our Clients or partners), track trends, and collect     information about how you use our Clients’ or partners’ websites or interact     with advertising. We and partners we work with use cookies to provide     relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better     match your interests. We may sometimes use other locally stored objects in     ways similar to how we use cookies. Often, these objects are deleted when     you clear your browser cookie cache, but because this may not always occur     (depending on the browser you use), we recommend that if you wish to opt out     of notification features or third party interest-based advertising you     instead follow the steps we have set forth in Section 7 titled “
Consumer Control & Opt-Out Options.
”
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.
We may use or work with partners who use mobile SDKs (including our     own SDKs, which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect     information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising     IDs), and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact     with our Services and those using our Services. The SDK is computer code     that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown,     data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use     this technology, for instance, to identify users through mobile applications     and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. We do     not collect advertising identifiers such as IDFAs or Android Advertising     IDs.
Social Media Widgets.
The OneSignal Website may include social media features, such as the     Twitter button, and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive     mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you     are visiting on the website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to     function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a     third party or hosted directly on the website. Your interactions with these     features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing     it.
Do Not Track Signals.
OneSignal currently does not respond to browser do not track (DNT)     signals, so we may not be aware of, or may be unable to respond to, such     signals.
6. Data Retention
Generally speaking, we retain the SDK Information and Website Information     for as long as reasonably necessary to achieve our objectives as detailed in     this Privacy Policy, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve     disputes and enforce our agreements. We may delete user information from     certain apps that we deem as “inactive,” in-line with applicable privacy     laws and privacy best practices, and in response to requests from Clients     and individuals. In general, “inactive” apps include apps with no recent     messages sent or impressions made, no recent logins by accounts associated     with the app, and/or no meaningful changes in user counts.
When considering the retention period for personal information, we consider     the nature, sensitivity, and amount of the personal information, the     potential risk of harm from unauthorized disclosure or use, and our legal,     regulatory, tax, accounting and other similar obligations.
For customers on our free plan, we delete push subscribers that have not     been active for the past 18 months. Push subscribers are considered dormant     if the subscriber: (1) has not used the customer’s  mobile app or     visited the customer’s  website in more than 18 months, or (2)     OneSignal has not processed any data points for the subscriber in more than     18 months. For customers on active paid plans, their subscribers will be     retained until the customer chooses to delete them.
7. Data Security
We have reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in     place in our physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and     communications networks. These safeguards are designed to protect     information from unauthorized or illegal access, destruction, use,     modification, or disclosure and to protect the confidentiality, integrity,     and accessibility of personal information. In addition, we are SOC 2 Type 2     certified and have a SOC 2 Type 2 report certifying that our security     policies and controls meet industry standards. This report captures how we     safeguard customer data and how well those controls are     operating.
Note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure     and  we cannot guarantee absolute security of personal     information.
8. Children
We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age     of 18. Our services and our website are directed to and intended for people     who are at least 18 years old or older. If you are a parent or guardian and     you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information,     please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal     information from anyone under the age of 18 without verification of parental     consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers and     databases.
If our Clients provide us with information about individuals under the age     of 18, as a service provider we rely on our Clients to obtain consent (if     required by applicable law) or provide opt out rights (if required by law)     and otherwise to provide such rights to individuals and their parents or     legal guardians as are required by applicable law, contract, or     otherwise.
9. Third-Party Websites and Apps
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of websites     and applications that use our Services. Likewise, when you access the     OneSignal Website, you may be directed to other websites that are also     beyond our control. We encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies     and terms and conditions of such third parties and websites, and the     industry tools that we have referenced in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy     Policy, however, only applies to the OneSignal Site and the     Services.
10. European Data - Legal Grounds
If you are a visitor to our OneSignal Website from the European Economic     Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and     using the personal information described above will depend on the personal     information concerned and the specific context in which we collect     it.
Our legal grounds for processing your personal information may be one or     more of the following:
Consent: in some cases, we rely on your consent, which you can withdraw at     any time
Performance of a contract with you: we might need to process your personal     information to perform our obligations or to take steps prior to entering     into a contract with you
Compliance with law: in some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or     retain your personal data
Legitimate interests: we may also process your personal information where it     is necessary for our legitimate interests in a way that might be expected as     part of running our business and not overridden by your data protection     interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
If we process your personal information on behalf of a Client, we rely on     our Client’s legal ground for processing your personal information on their     behalf.
11. Individuals From Outside the United States
Data is hosted and stored in Europe and accessed in the United States, as     well as other countries where our offices or facilities are located or where     our service providers operate. The data protection and other laws of the     United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By     using the OneSignal Website or Services you consent to your information     being transferred to our offices and facilities and to those of our service     providers to whom we disclose it.
Standard Contractual Clauses
If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or     Switzerland, we will protect your personal information when it is     transferred outside of your jurisdiction by (a) processing it in a territory     that provides an adequate level of protection based on its data protection     laws; or (b) implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal     information, such as relying on the European standard contractual clauses     (and the United Kingdom addendum, if applicable). OneSignal currently relies     on these European standard contractual clauses for data transfers and the     Data Privacy Framework (see below).
Data Privacy Framework
OneSignal complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK     Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data     Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. OneSignal     has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the     EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“
EU-U.S. DPF Principles
”) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the     European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom in     reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. OneSignal has certified to     the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data     Privacy Framework Principles (“
Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles
”) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland     in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the     terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the     Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the DPF principles shall govern. To learn more     about the Data Privacy Framework (“
DPF
”) program, and to view our certification page, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list
.
OneSignal commits to applying the DPF’s Principles to all Personal Data     that OneSignal in the U.S. receives from European Economic Area member     countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland in reliance on the respective     DPF.
Our compliance with the DPF is subject to the investigatory and enforcement     powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In accordance with the DPF, we     are also liable for onward transfers to third parties that process personal     information in a way that does not follow the DPF.
Please email us at
privacy@onesignal.com
with any questions, concerns, or complaints about our DPF certification. You     can resolve any applicable disputes with us related to our certification     free of charge through JAMS (
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
), an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.     You can contact JAMS as described at
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
.
In some situations, the DPF Framework gives you the right to invoke binding     arbitration. You can do this to resolve complaints not resolved by other     means, as described in Annex I to the DPF Framework (
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/framework-text
)
OneSignal agrees to periodically review and verify its compliance with the     DPF Principles, and to remedy any issues arising out of failure to comply     with the DPF Principles. OneSignal acknowledges that its failure to provide     an annual self-certification to the U.S. Department of Commerce will remove     it from the Department’s list of DPF participants.
12. Consumer Control and Opt Out Options
You may have the following privacy rights:
If you wish to
access, correct, or request deletion
of your     personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us at
Privacy@OneSignal.com
.
If you wish to
opt-out of marketing communications
(including emails),     click on the “opt-out” link in our marketing communications or contact us at
Privacy@OneSignal.com
.
See
Certain US Rights
and
Rights of Europeans
below for additional rights that may apply to you.
Opting Out of OneSignal Push Notifications
You may in most cases opt out of receiving push notifications by going to     your device “Settings” and clicking on “Notifications,” and then changing     those settings for some or all of the apps on your device. Different device     configurations, or updates to devices, may affect or change how these     settings work.
Your choice to opt out of “Notifications” from the OneSignal platform will     not affect notifications placed by any other organization.
Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising by Third Parties
You can opt out of many of the platforms and service providers that     facilitate online interest-based advertising by visiting the Digital     Advertising Alliance’s consumer education and opt-out page, at     http://www.aboutads.info/. This type of opt out is cookie based and specific     to each browser, which means that if you replace or upgrade your browser, or     delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again. Opting out in this way     will not prevent you from receiving ads – it will just make the ads you see     less customized to you.
Opting Out of “Cross-App” Advertising on Mobile Devices by Third       Parties
You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for     certain types of interest-based (also called “cross-app”) mobile behavioral     advertising, by accessing the “settings” on your Apple or Android mobile     device.
Additional Choices – Our Clients
Our Clients may also provide ways for you to opt out from or limit their     collection of information from and about you. Please refer to the privacy     policies of our Clients to learn more about their privacy     practices.
Where you wish to enforce any of these rights in respect of our Services,     you should contact the Client who provides you with the website or mobile     application. We will then help them to fulfill that request in accordance     with their instructions and applicable legal requirements.
Additional Choices - Europeans
In accordance with European data protection law and the Data Privacy     Framework, you may opt out of having your personal information used for a     purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was     originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. We do not disclose     your personal data to third parties except to our service providers who act     on our behalf.  If we were to disclose your personal data to other     parties who are not our service providers, we would allow you to opt     out.
We ask that our clients not disclose to us any sensitive information about     you (e.g., personal information specifying medical or health conditions,     racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical     beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of     the individual). If we do receive sensitive information about you from our     clients, then European data protection law and the Data Privacy Framework     requires us to obtain your consent. We rely on our clients to obtain any     consent needed to disclose sensitive information to us.

Content also includes the files and links you upload to the Services. If you use a server or data center version of the Services, we do not host, store, transmit, receive or collect information about you (including your content), except in limited cases, where permitted by your administrator: we collect feedback you provide directly to us through the product and; we collect content using analytics techniques that hash, filter or otherwise scrub the information to exclude information that might identify you or your organization; and we collect clickstream data about how you interact with and use features in the Services. Server and data center administrators can disable our collection of this information from the Services via the administrator settings or prevent this information from being disclosed to us by blocking transmission at the local network level.
Content you provide through our websites:
The Services also include our websites owned or operated by us. We collect other content that you submit to these websites, which include social media or social networking websites operated by us. For example, you provide content to us when you provide feedback or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, activities or events.
Information you provide through our support channels:
The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service.  Whether you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.

We collect payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services.  For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information, upon registration.  You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.
Information we collect automatically when you use the Services
We collect information about you when you use our Services, including browsing our websites and taking certain actions within the Services.
Your use of the Services
: We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our Services. This information includes the features you use; the links you click on; the type, size and filenames of attachments you upload to the Services; search terms; your team’s Jira Align story progress; and how you interact with others on the Services.  We also collect information about the teams and people you work with and how you work with them, like who you collaborate with and communicate with most frequently.  If you use a server or data center version of the Services, the information we collect about your use of the Services is limited to clickstream data about how you interact with and use features in the Services, in addition to content-related information described in "Content you provide through our products," above.  Server and data center administrators can disable our collection of this information from the Services via the administrator settings or prevent this information from being disclosed to us by blocking transmission at the local network level.

This device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience.  How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.  Server and data center Service administrators can disable collection of this information via the administrator settings or prevent this information from being disclosed to us by blocking transmission at the local network level.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
: Atlassian and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices. For more information, please see our
Cookies and Tracking Notice
, which includes information on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies. Please refer to
Loom's Cookie Policy
for details on cookies and tracking technologies used within Loom products and websites.
Information we receive from other sources
We receive information about you from other Service users, from third-party services, from our related companies, social media platforms, public databases, and from our business and channel partners. We may combine this information with information we collect through other means described above. This helps us to update and improve our records, identify new customers, create more personalized advertising and suggest services that may be of interest to you.
Other users of the Services
: Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they submit content through the Services. For example, you may be mentioned in a Jira issue or paged via an Opsgenie incident opened by someone else, a team member may upload content about you to a Trello board, or your team’s story status may be discussed in Jira Align.  We also receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services.  Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they designate you as the billing or technical contact on your company's account or when they designate you as an administrator.
Other services you link to your account
: We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate third-party apps, like Power-UPs, or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. You or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, disclose and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services.  For example, you may authorize our Services to access, display and store files from a third-party document-sharing service within the Services interface. Or you may authorize our Services to connect with a third-party calendaring service or to sync a contact list or address book so that your meetings and connections are available to you through the Services, so you can invite others to collaborate with you on our Services or so your organization can limit access to certain users. Your administrator may also authorize our Services to connect with a third party reporting service so your organization can review how the Services are being used. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
Atlassian Companies
:  We receive information about you from other Atlassian corporate affiliates, in accordance with their terms and policies.
Atlassian Partners
:  We work with a
global network of partners
who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products.  Some of these partners also help us to market and promote our Services, generate leads for us, and resell our Services.  We receive information from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what Atlassian Services you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.
Other Partners
: We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.
Third Party Providers
: We may receive information about you from third party providers of business information and publicly available sources (like social media platforms), including physical mail addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior data), IP addresses and social media profiles, for the purposes of targeted advertising of products that may interest you, delivering personalized communications, event promotion, and profiling.
How we use information we collect
How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us.  Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.
To provide the Services and personalize your experience
: We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate, maintain, and improve the Services.  For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team.  For example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function.  We also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites. Based on your interactions with different Atlassian products and advertisements, we will personalize your experience and tailor our communications and offers to you. To opt out of this personalization, please contact privacy@atlassian.com.
For research and development
:  We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful.  We use information and collective learnings (including feedback) about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public. For example, to improve the @mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to surface the most relevant connections for users. We automatically analyze and aggregate search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.
To communicate with you about the Services
: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.  We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are @mentioned on a page or ticket, when a task is assigned to you, or when you are added to a Trello board. Depending on your chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you if you are on-call for incident alerts in Opsgenie.
We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.  For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.  We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them.  If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.
To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services:
We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications.  These communications may be informed by audits of interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.  We also communicate with you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests.  You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of communications."
Customer support
: We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services. Where you give us express permission to do so, we disclose information to a third party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.
For safety and security
: We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including violations of Service policies.
To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights
:
Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.
With your consent
: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.  For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.
Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)
:
If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.  The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:
We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.
How we disclose information we collect
We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you.  This means disclosing information through the Services and to certain third parties.  We disclose information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers. Please note that information about you, your devices, and your behavior collected through third-party cookies, pixels, tags, or other tracking technologies for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising may be considered a “sale” or “share” under certain US state laws. However, Atlassian is not a data broker, and we do not sell personal information for monetary consideration.
Disclosing to other Service users
When you use the Services, we disclose certain information about you to other Service users.
For collaboration
: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, disclose, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select.  Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you disclose or interact with specific content.  For example, when you comment on a Confluence page or Jira issue, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment. Similarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.  Your team’s story status in Jira Align or certain profile information when you are listed in an Opsgenie on-call schedule, can be seen by other users with certain role permissions or team assignments. Please be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages, Bitbucket repositories, or Trello boards can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted in that space, including information about you, can be publicly viewed, indexed by, and returned in search results of search engines.  You can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.
Managed accounts and administrators
: If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization or associate that email address with your existing account, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.  If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may disclose your contact information to current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.
Community Forums
:  Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis (e.g.,
Atlassian Community
,
Atlassian Developer Community
,
Trello Community
, and
Trello Inspiration
). You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.  Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.
Disclosing to third parties
We disclose information to third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services. All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties, excluding aggregators and providers of the text messaging services.
Service Providers
: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis, marketing, and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.  If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including appropriate security and confidentiality procedures designed to protect your information.
Atlassian Partners
: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, support, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services. We may disclose your information to these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations.  We may also disclose information to these third parties where you have agreed to that disclosure.
Third Party Apps
: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services.  Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.  If you are an administrator, or a technical or billing contact listed on an account, we disclose your details to the third-party app provider upon installation. Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being disclosed to these third parties, please uninstall the app.
Links to Third Party Sites
: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
Third Party Services:
We may offer you the ability to interact with or disclose information to third parties through the Services. For example, we may offer users the ability to log in to the Services via a third-party service like Google, access embedded maps through Google Maps or interact with social media networks via links on the Services. When you intentionally interact with these third parties, we may disclose certain information to those third parties or receive information with those third parties, consistent with your privacy settings on the third-party service. Such information may include contact information, identification, and demographic information, and device information and identifiers. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.
Third Party Widgets
: Some of our services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter "tweet" button or Facebook "like" button. These widgets and features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Services. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.
With your consent
: We disclose information about you to third parties when you give us consent to do so.  For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.
Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights
: In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose information about you to a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. For more information on how we respond to government requests, see our
Guidelines for Law Enforcement
and our
Transparency Report
.
Disclosing to affiliated companies
We disclose information we collect to affiliated companies and, in some cases, to prospective affiliates.  Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us.  The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we disclose in these circumstances.
Atlassian companies
: We disclose information we have about you to other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you. This includes companies that own or operate the Services.
Business Transfers
: We may disclose or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.
How we store and secure information we collect
Information storage and security
We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store. For more information on where and how we store your information, please see the
Atlassian Trust
,
Trello Trust
, and
Jira Align Trust
pages.
While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Atlassian. We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.
How long we keep information
How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.  After such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
Account information
: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.  We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.
Information you share on the Services
: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.  For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided, but when requested details that can identify you will be removed.
Managed accounts
: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.  For more information, see "Managed accounts and administrators" above.
Marketing information
: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account.  We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.
How to access and control your information
You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.
Your Choices
:
Where applicable under local law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information.
Depending on which jurisdiction you live in, you may have the right to request information about our processing of your information, to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, to request your information in a structured, electronic format, to request to correct or update your information, to request to opt out of “sales” or “sharing” of personal information and targeted advertising (as these terms are defined under applicable law), and to request to opt out of certain profiling activities.  Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.  You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see "Notice to End Users" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.  For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.
Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.  Where you have asked us to disclose data to third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.  If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed. Where applicable under local law, you may also contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below to appeal any decision we make relating to your request to exercise your rights.
Access and update your information
: Our Services and related documentation (see
Atlassian Documentation
,
Trello Help
, and
Loom Documentation
) give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using key word searches in the Service.  You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.
Deactivate your account
:   If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account. If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact the appropriate support team through
Atlassian
’s support pages.  Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services.  For more information on how to delete your information, see below.
Delete your information
: Our Services and related documentation (see
Atlassian Documentation
, and
Loom Documentation
) give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.
Request that we stop using your information
:  In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.  For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.  Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for certain marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.  When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.  If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).  If you object to information about you being disclosed to a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.
Opt out of communications
: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.  Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings. Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.
Opt out of targeted advertising
: Where applicable under local law, you may have the right to opt out of targeted advertising by

Data portability
: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).  Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.  Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole control, like your personal Bitbucket repository.
How we transfer information we collect internationally
International transfers of information we collect
We collect information globally and may transfer, process, and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services.  Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.
International transfers within the Atlassian Companies
: To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information globally and allow access to that information from countries in which the Atlassian owned or operated companies have operations for the purposes described in this policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based. When we disclose information about you within and among Atlassian corporate affiliates, we make use of the Data Privacy Framework to receive personal data transfers from the European Union/European Economic Area to the U.S. (see “Data Privacy Framework Notice” section below), and the standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission, to safeguard the transfer of information we collect from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (the "UK"), and Switzerland. Refer to
this page
for a list of countries to which we regularly transfer personal data.
International transfers to third parties
: Some of the third parties described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we disclose information of customers in the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland, we make use of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses, binding corporate rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.
Data Privacy Framework Notice
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) entered into force.
Atlassian, Inc. and its U.S. subsidiaries (Atlassian Network Service, Inc., Dogwood Labs, Inc., AgileCraft LLC, Halp, Inc., Loom, Inc., Opsgenie, Inc., and Trello, Inc.) adhere to the Data Privacy Framework Principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data that is transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S.
Atlassian complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Atlassian has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Atlassian has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework Program, please visit the Data Privacy Framework Program website

. To view Atlassian’s certifications, search for “Atlassian” in the Data Privacy Framework List.
As required under the principles, when we receive information under the Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Data Privacy Framework if the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Data Privacy Framework related (or general privacy-related) complaint.  If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our
U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider
(free of charge).  Through this third-party dispute resolution provider, we have also committed to cooperating and complying with the information and advice provided by an informal panel of data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (as applicable) in relation to unresolved complaints (as further described in the Data Privacy Framework Principles). You may also contact your local data protection authority within the European Economic Area or Switzerland (as applicable) for unresolved complaints.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the
Data Privacy Framework website
, including when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted, you may invoke binding arbitration.
Atlassian, Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Other important privacy information
Notice to End Users
Many of our products are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.
Administrators are able to:
require you to reset your account password;
restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;
access information in and about your account;
access or retain information stored as part of your account;
install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations
In some cases, administrators can also:
restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;
change the email address associated with your account;
change your information, including profile information;
restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information
Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you are a member of a Trello team administered by an organization, or if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date.  You will be notified if this happens.
If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, you should deactivate your membership with the relevant Trello board, team or enterprise, or use your personal email address to register for or access the Services.  If an administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile.  Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.
Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.
