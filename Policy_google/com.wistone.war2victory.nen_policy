14. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND INCLUDES WAIVER OF A TRIAL BY JURY IN A COURT AND OF THE ABILITY TO BRING ANY CLAIM ON BEHALF OF OTHERS.
This Section 14 (i.e., the “Agreement to Arbitrate”) applies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of provisions of this Section 14 notwithstanding Section 15 below, those prohibited provisions will not apply to you.
Most user concerns can be resolved by contacting our customer support team
or in-game PM
or via
customer service
email
indicated in this Terms of Use
. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains, this Section explains how you and we agree to resolve it. As explained in more detail below,
we each agree to resolve any dispute between us through binding arbitration
instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.
Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
This
policy shall be interpreted and governed by the law of
the People’s Republic of China
. Dispute in any form between you and
WiSTONE
shall be settled through discussions. Where it fails,
either party has the right to submit the dispute to
China International Economic and
Trade Arbitration Commis
s
ion (ww.cietac.org)
for arbitration in Beijing in accordance with its arbitration rules effective then
Agreement to Arbitrate;
If we cannot resolve our dispute through customer support, YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION, INCLUDING CLAIMS CONCERNING ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US, YOUR DECISION TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME, YOUR USE OF THE GAME, ANY USER CONTENT, OR YOUR ACCOUNT. This Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly, and applies to all legal claims under any legal theory (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory), and applies to any disputes or claims that you assert or that arise even after you stop using or delete your account for the Game, stop using the Game, or delete the Game application from your mobile/PC
/console
device. This Agreement to
Arbitrate
also applies to any claims that are currently the subject of a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. If you and we have a dispute about whether this Agreement to Arbitrate can be enforced or
applies
to our dispute, you and we agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue as well.
An arbitration
is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.
Class Action Waiver
For disputes arising between
WiSTONE
and you, or any other
user, that
are subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, you and we agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. NEITHER YOU NOR WE CAN BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR CANNOT COMBINE MORE THAN ONCE PERSON’S CLAIM INTO A SINGLE CASE, AND CANNOT PRESIDE OVER ANY CONSOLIDATED, CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING, UNLESS WE BOTH AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING. THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION OR AWARD IN ONE PERSON’S CASE CAN ONLY AFFECT THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT THE CLAIM, NOT OTHER USERS OF THE GAME, AND CANNOT BE USED TO DECIDE DISPUTES WITH OTHERS.
If a court decides that this “Class Action Waiver” subsection is not enforceable or is invalid, then Section 14 shall cease to have effect, however, the remaining portions of the Terms and Conditions will remain in full force and effect.
15. APPLICABLE LAW.
You agree that these Terms of Use shall be deemed to have been made and executed i
n the
People’s Republic
of
China
.
and that any dispute arising under the Terms of Use, as well as any other dispute or claim that may arise between you and us, shall be governed by and resolved in accordance with
the laws of
People’s Republic
of
China
,
without regard to conflict of law provisions or principles.
16. THIRD PARTY PROMOTIONS AND LINKS.

Some of these Third Party Promotions may charge separate fees, which are not included in any fees that you may pay to us. Any separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with such third parties are your responsibility. We make no representation or warranty regarding any content, goods and/or services contained in such Third Party Promotions and will not be liable for any claim relating thereto. We exercise no control over Third Party Promotions, and
