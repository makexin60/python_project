The app needs this permission to permanently store usage data and local settings in your phone's memory.  
It only writes to one file and doesn't read any other files except that particular one. No other content is accessed (no images or otherwise). Android provides a specific permission granularity to specify the type of files being accessed, which is why it's called "Photos/Media/Files".
