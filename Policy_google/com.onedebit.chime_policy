California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, you have rights regarding your personal information. Those rights and other state-specific information is described below:
Access
. You have a right to request that we disclose to you, twice in a 12-month period, the personal information we have collected about you. You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information, which is also provided in this Notice.
Correction
. You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.
Deletion
. You have the right to request that we delete your personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.
Opt-Out of the Selling or Sharing of your Personal Information.
You have the right to opt out of the selling or sharing of your data. The CCPA requires us to describe the categories of personal information we sell or share to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales. It is important to know that the definition of “sale” and “share” is very broad and the common flow of information for advertising and analytics may be considered a sale or sharing. Chime does not provide information that you might typically think of as personal information to third parties in exchange for money; however, under the CCPA, personal information includes unique identifiers, including things like IP addresses, cookie IDs, pixel tags, and mobile ad IDs. The law defines a “sale” broadly to include simply making such personal information available to third parties in some cases. “Share” is defined as providing personal information to a third party to target advertising to a consumer based on information about their activity on multiple websites across the internet. In the last 12 months, when you access our online Services, we may let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, advertising IDs, and other unique identifiers, which may be collected along with device and usage data, and information about your interactions with our online Services and advertisements. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. Learn more about this opt-out on our FAQ page
here
. Learn more about how to opt-out in the “How to Submit a Sale, Share, or Targeted Advertising Opt-Out Request” section under “Your Choices” in this Notice.
Obtaining a portable copy of your personal information
. You have the right to obtain a portable copy of your personal information. To obtain a copy of your personal information that you previously provided to us in a portable format, please submit an “Access” request as described above. While these requests are distinct, we have not identified any technically feasible and readily usable format that would allow you to transmit this data to another controller. Therefore, we will provide you a copy of your personal information so that we honor your request as best as is technically feasible.
Shine the Light Request
. You have the right to request that we provide you with (a) a list of certain categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and (b) the identity of those third parties.
Joint Marketing with other Financial Institutions
. You have the right to opt-out of joint marketing with other financial institutions. If you would like to opt out of joint marketing with other financial institutions by submitting a request through the
Chime Privacy Hub.
Appeal
. You have the right to appeal our decision to refuse to act on a CCPA data privacy request within a reasonable period after you receive our decision. To appeal our decision, forward your denial email to
privacy@chime.com
for Chime’s Privacy Team to review your data subject request. Within 45 days, we will provide you with a written explanation of the justification for declining to act on your request.
Non-Discrimination.
You have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of your privacy rights.
Authentication/Verification
. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request (except for a request to opt-out of sales or sharing). We may require you to provide any of the following information: your name, date of birth, the last four digits of your Social Security number, the email and physical addresses associated with your Chime account, one or more recent transactions, and the last four digits of one or more Chime-branded cards associated with your account. If you ask us to provide you with specific pieces of personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law.
Retention
. We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different Services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.
Notice of Financial Incentives
. Chime may offer rewards or prizes for participation in certain activities that may be considered a “financial incentive” under California law. These activities may involve the collection of personal information. The categories of personal information we collect is limited to what information you provide us, but may include: identifiers, protected class/demographic information, commercial information, online activities, geolocation information (general and precise), sensory information, employment information, and inferences. Activities we engage in that may be considered a financial incentive include surveys where we may provide compensation such as a gift card or SpotMe bonus in exchange for your time and responses, or a prize through your participation in promotions and sweepstakes. Participation in these programs may be subject to separate terms and conditions. Your participation in these programs is voluntary and you can terminate at any time as explained in any applicable terms. When we offer gift cards in exchange for your participation in a survey or when we engage in promotions or sweepstakes, the amount provided is reasonably related to the value of the data you provide, which takes into account a number of factors, including, the anticipated benefit we receive such as product improvement, better understanding how you use our products, to enhance our understanding of consumer and market trends, increased consumer engagement, and the anticipated expenses we incur in relation to the collection, storage, and use of the information we receive. The value may vary across surveys, promotions, and sweepstakes.
Declining Requests
. Except for the automated controls described in this Notice, if you send us a request to exercise your rights or the choices in this section, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a fee or decline requests in certain cases. For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, would interfere with a legal or business obligation that requires retention or use of the data, or because the data at issue is not covered under the law you are asserting.
Colorado Consumers
If you are a Colorado resident, you have rights regarding your personal information. Those rights and other state-specific information is described below:
Access
. You have the right to request that we disclose to you, once in a 12-month period, the personal information we have collected about you.

Opt-Out of the Selling and Targeted Advertising
. You have the right to opt out of targeted advertising, and the sale of your personal information. Colorado law requires us to describe the categories of personal information we sell or share to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales. It is important to know that the definition of “sale” is very broad and the common flow of information for advertising and analytics may be considered a sale. Chime does not provide information that you might typically think of as personal information to third parties in exchange for money; however, under Colorado law, personal information may include unique identifiers, including things like IP addresses, cookie IDs, pixel tags, and mobile ad IDs. The law defines a “sale” broadly to include simply making such personal information available to third parties in some cases. In the last 12 months, when you access our online Services, we may let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, advertising IDs, and other unique identifiers, which may be collected along with device and usage data, and information about your interactions with our online Services and advertisements. We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. Learn more about how to opt-out of targeted advertising or the sale of personal information in the “How to Submit a Sale, Share, or Targeted Advertising Opt-Out Request” section under “Your Choices” in this Notice.

Correction
. You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.

Opt-Out of the Selling or Sharing of your Personal Information.
You have the right to opt out of the selling or sharing of your data. The CCPA requires us to describe the categories of personal information we sell or share to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales. It is important to know that the definition of “sale” and “share” is very broad and the common flow of information for advertising and analytics may be considered a sale or sharing. Chime does not provide information that you might typically think of as personal information to third parties in exchange for money; however, under the CCPA, personal information includes unique identifiers, including things like IP addresses, cookie IDs, pixel tags, and mobile ad IDs. The law defines a “sale” broadly to include simply making such personal information available to third parties in some cases. “Share” is defined as providing personal information to a third party to target advertising to a consumer based on information about their activity on multiple websites across the internet. In the last 12 months, when you access our online Services, we may let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, advertising IDs, and other unique identifiers, which may be collected along with device and usage data, and information about your interactions with our online Services and advertisements. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. Learn more about this opt-out on our FAQ page
here
. Learn more about how to opt-out in the “How to Submit a Sale, Share, or Targeted Advertising Opt-Out Request” section under “Your Choices” in this Notice.
Obtaining a portable copy of your personal information
. You have the right to obtain a portable copy of your personal information. To obtain a copy of your personal information that you previously provided to us in a portable format, please submit an “Access” request as described above. While these requests are distinct, we have not identified any technically feasible and readily usable format that would allow you to transmit this data to another controller. Therefore, we will provide you a copy of your personal information so that we honor your request as best as is technically feasible.
Shine the Light Request
. You have the right to request that we provide you with (a) a list of certain categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and (b) the identity of those third parties.
Joint Marketing with other Financial Institutions

Authentication/Verification
. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request (except for a request to opt-out of sales or sharing). We may require you to provide any of the following information: your name, date of birth, the last four digits of your Social Security number, the email and physical addresses associated with your Chime account, one or more recent transactions, and the last four digits of one or more Chime-branded cards associated with your account. If you ask us to provide you with specific pieces of personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law.
Retention
. We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different Services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.
Notice of Financial Incentives
. Chime may offer rewards or prizes for participation in certain activities that may be considered a “financial incentive” under California law. These activities may involve the collection of personal information. The categories of personal information we collect is limited to what information you provide us, but may include: identifiers, protected class/demographic information, commercial information, online activities, geolocation information (general and precise), sensory information, employment information, and inferences. Activities we engage in that may be considered a financial incentive include surveys where we may provide compensation such as a gift card or SpotMe bonus in exchange for your time and responses, or a prize through your participation in promotions and sweepstakes. Participation in these programs may be subject to separate terms and conditions. Your participation in these programs is voluntary and you can terminate at any time as explained in any applicable terms. When we offer gift cards in exchange for your participation in a survey or when we engage in promotions or sweepstakes, the amount provided is reasonably related to the value of the data you provide, which takes into account a number of factors, including, the anticipated benefit we receive such as product improvement, better understanding how you use our products, to enhance our understanding of consumer and market trends, increased consumer engagement, and the anticipated expenses we incur in relation to the collection, storage, and use of the information we receive. The value may vary across surveys, promotions, and sweepstakes.
Declining Requests
. Except for the automated controls described in this Notice, if you send us a request to exercise your rights or the choices in this section, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a fee or decline requests in certain cases. For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, would interfere with a legal or business obligation that requires retention or use of the data, or because the data at issue is not covered under the law you are asserting.

California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, you have rights regarding your personal information. Those rights and other state-specific information is described below:
Access
. You have a right to request that we disclose to you, twice in a 12-month period, the personal information we have collected about you. You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information, which is also provided in this Notice.
Correction
. You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.
Deletion
. You have the right to request that we delete your personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.
Opt-Out of the Selling or Sharing of your Personal Information.
You have the right to opt out of the selling or sharing of your data. The CCPA requires us to describe the categories of personal information we sell or share to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales. It is important to know that the definition of “sale” and “share” is very broad and the common flow of information for advertising and analytics may be considered a sale or sharing. Chime does not provide information that you might typically think of as personal information to third parties in exchange for money; however, under the CCPA, personal information includes unique identifiers, including things like IP addresses, cookie IDs, pixel tags, and mobile ad IDs. The law defines a “sale” broadly to include simply making such personal information available to third parties in some cases. “Share” is defined as providing personal information to a third party to target advertising to a consumer based on information about their activity on multiple websites across the internet. In the last 12 months, when you access our online Services, we may let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, advertising IDs, and other unique identifiers, which may be collected along with device and usage data, and information about your interactions with our online Services and advertisements. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. Learn more about this opt-out on our FAQ page
here
. Learn more about how to opt-out in the “How to Submit a Sale, Share, or Targeted Advertising Opt-Out Request” section under “Your Choices” in this Notice.
Obtaining a portable copy of your personal information
. You have the right to obtain a portable copy of your personal information. To obtain a copy of your personal information that you previously provided to us in a portable format, please submit an “Access” request as described above.

Therefore, we will provide you a copy of your personal information so that we honor your request as best as is technically feasible.
Shine the Light Request
. You have the right to request that we provide you with (a) a list of certain categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and (b) the identity of those third parties.
Joint Marketing with other Financial Institutions

If you ask us to provide you with specific pieces of personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law.
Retention
. We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different Services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.
Notice of Financial Incentives
. Chime may offer rewards or prizes for participation in certain activities that may be considered a “financial incentive” under California law. These activities may involve the collection of personal information. The categories of personal information we collect is limited to what information you provide us, but may include: identifiers, protected class/demographic information, commercial information, online activities, geolocation information (general and precise), sensory information, employment information, and inferences. Activities we engage in that may be considered a financial incentive include surveys where we may provide compensation such as a gift card or SpotMe bonus in exchange for your time and responses, or a prize through your participation in promotions and sweepstakes. Participation in these programs may be subject to separate terms and conditions. Your participation in these programs is voluntary and you can terminate at any time as explained in any applicable terms. When we offer gift cards in exchange for your participation in a survey or when we engage in promotions or sweepstakes, the amount provided is reasonably related to the value of the data you provide, which takes into account a number of factors, including, the anticipated benefit we receive such as product improvement, better understanding how you use our products, to enhance our understanding of consumer and market trends, increased consumer engagement, and the anticipated expenses we incur in relation to the collection, storage, and use of the information we receive. The value may vary across surveys, promotions, and sweepstakes.
Declining Requests
. Except for the automated controls described in this Notice, if you send us a request to exercise your rights or the choices in this section, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a fee or decline requests in certain cases. For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, would interfere with a legal or business obligation that requires retention or use of the data, or because the data at issue is not covered under the law you are asserting.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
