Who is Nasty Gal
Nasty Gal was founded by Sophia Amoruso 15 years ago in a tiny San Francisco apartment stacked with killer vintage discoveries, a single laptop, and an eBay account. Today, Nasty Gal is a bold and distinctive brand for fashion-forward, free-thinking young women, and is recognized as a pioneer in both the curation and design of limited edition women's clothing, shoes, and accessories. The company has a global presence in 180 countries and a social media following of over 7.37 million. The Boohoo group acquired Nasty Gal in February 2017, adding to their existing portfolio of fashion brands: boohooMAN and PLT.

If you have any questions about how PLT use any of your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at DPO@prettylittlething.com.
Your Rights
You have several rights under the data privacy legislation. This includes, under certain circumstances, the right to:
request access to your personal data
request correction of your personal data
request erasure of your personal data
request restriction of processing of your personal data
request the transfer of your personal data
object to processing of your personal data
request human intervention for automated decision making
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email us at DPO@prettylittlething.com..
Request access to your personal data
You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain information relating to our processing of your personal data.
Request correction of your personal data
You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update your personal data at any time by logging into your
account
and updating your details directly, or by emailing us at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
.
Request erasure of your personal data
This enables you to request that PLT delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data
You have a right to ask PLT to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing is restricted, we are allowed to retain sufficient information about you to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.
Request the transfer of your personal data
You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to another company. Please note though that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you.
Object to processing of your personal data
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we believe we have a legitimate interest in processing it (as explained above). You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms.
Request human intervention for automated decision making and profiling
You have the right to request human intervention where we are carrying out automated decision making when processing your personal data. This form of processing is permitted where it is necessary as part of our contract with you, providing that appropriate safeguards are in place or your explicit consent has been obtained.
We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Right to lodge a complaint
If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the way in which we process your data, please email us directly at DPO@prettylittlething.com. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK) or (if you are located in the European Union) any other competent supervisory authority in your country of residence (a list of supervisory authorities can be found here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO or any other supervisory authority, so please do contact us in the first instance.
Your data and countries outside of Europe
The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") using legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.
              Whenever we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. This may include using specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in Europe. More information about these is available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087
              Please contact us if you want further information on the countries to which we may transfer personal data and the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the EEA.
How long we keep your data for
We will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) it was provided for and to meet our legal obligations. Further details of the periods for which we retain data are available on request.
Changes to this GDPR Addendum
From time to time we may change this GDPR Addendum. If there are any significant changes we will post updates on our website, applications or let you know by email.

Effective Date: 1st January 2023
Last Reviewed on: 1st January 2023
This Privacy Notice Addendum for California Residents (the “California Privacy Addendum”) supplements the information contained in PLT’s privacy notice and describes our collection and use of Personal Information (as defined below). This California Privacy Addendum applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (“Consumers” or “you”). We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the “CPRA”) and any terms defined in the CPRA have the same meaning when used in this notice.
Scope of this California Privacy Addendum

This California Privacy Addendum does not apply to employment-related Personal Information collected from our California-based employees, job applicants, contractors, or similar individuals (“Personnel”). Please contact your local human resources department if you are part of our California Personnel and would like additional information about how we process your Personal Information.

To Whom Do We Sell or Share Your Personal Information
We do not sell Personal Information as the term “sell” is commonly understood to require an exchange for money. However, the use of advertising and analytics cookies on our Website is considered a “sale” of Personal Information as the term “sale” is broadly defined in the CPRA to include both monetary and other valuable consideration. Our “sale” is limited to our use of third-party advertising and analytics cookies and their use in providing behavioral advertising and their use in understanding how people use and interact with our website(s) and applications.

Our “sharing” for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising would be limited to our use of third-party advertising cookies and their use in providing you cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., advertising on other websites or in other mediums). When the recipients of your Personal Information disclosed for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising are also permitted to use your Personal Information to provide advertising to others, we also consider this disclosure as a “sale” for monetary or other valuable consideration under the CPRA.

Consumer Data Requests
The CPRA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. You may exercise these rights yourself or through your Authorized Agent. For more information on how you or your Authorized Agent can exercise your rights, please see Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights. These rights include the right to:
Request to know the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you and how we have used it
Request access to your Personal Information.
Request correction of your Personal Information.
Request deletion of your Personal Information.
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. You also have the right to opt-out of our sale or sharing of your personal data, as described further below.
Right to Know.
You have the right to request that PLT disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months (a “Right to Know” Consumer Request).
Access to Specific Pieces of Information (Data Portability).
You also have the right to request that PLT provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, including any Personal Information that we have created or otherwise received from a third-party about you (a “Data Portability” Consumer Request).
Correction.
You have the right to request that we correct any incorrect Personal Information about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. In addition to other methods you may have to exercise this right as described below, you may review and correct some Personal Information about yourself by logging into your account page and updating your details directly.
Deletion.
You have the right to request that PLT delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights
To exercise the rights described above, please submit a request (a “Consumer Request”) to us by either:
·       Emailing us at DPO@prettylittlething.com
·       Writing to us at: Boohoo Group Legal Team, 8431 Melrose Place, Los Angeles, USA
If you fail to make your Consumer Request in accordance with the ways described above, we may either treat your request as if it had been submitted with our methods described above or provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with your request. 
              Only you, or your Authorized Agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Consumer Request related to your Personal Information. To designate an Authorized Agent, see Authorized Agents below.
All Consumer Requests must:
·       Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an Authorized Agent of such a person. This may include:
·       Verifying Personal Information that we may already have about you, such as prior order numbers, address / ZIP code, and other similar information.
·       Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm which Personal Information relates to you or the individual for whom you are making the request as their Authorized Agent. 
              Making a Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
              We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. 
              For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information.
Authorized Agents
You may authorize your agent to exercise your rights under the CPRA on your behalf by registering your agent with the California Secretary of State or by providing them with power of attorney to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable laws (an “Authorized Agent”). We may request that your Authorized Agent submit proof of identity and that they have been authorized exercise your rights on your behalf. We may deny a request from your Authorized Agent to exercise your rights on your behalf if they fail to submit adequate proof of identity or adequate proof that they have the authority to exercise your rights. 
              In response to a Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Request, we will provide you with all relevant information we have collected or maintained about you on or after January 1, 2022, unless an exception applies. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data Portability Consumer Request, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, such as CSV file(s) and/or PDF file(s).
              We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. We reserve the right to consider more than two (2) total Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Requests (or combination of the two) in a twelve (12) month period to be repetitive and/or excessive and require a fee. If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information
                             “Sale” of Your Personal Information
As described above, our use of cookies is considered a “sale” under the CPRA. We do not otherwise sell your Personal Information for monetary consideration. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not “sell” your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not “sell” the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information “sales” may opt-out of future “sales” at any time.
“Sharing” of Your Personal Information
If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not share your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is showing advertising on other websites or other media based on your browsing history with our websites and applications (the “right to opt-out”). We do not share the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age for this purpose, unless we receive affirmative authorization from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to our sharing of Personal Information for these purposes may opt-out of future such sharing at any time.
How You May Opt-Out of Our Sale or Sharing of Your Personal Information
To exercise the right to opt-out of the “sale” and the “sharing” your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, you may do so by any of the following: clicking the link below, adjusting your cookie preferences, or by configuring your browser to send us a privacy signal as described in more detail below. You may also opt-out of such “sales” and “sharing” by setting your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do not consent to our use of cookies or select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites or applications or other websites. You can find more information about cookies at
http://www.allaboutcookies.org
and
http://youronlinechoices.eu
.
Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of Personal Information at any time by:
If you have opted out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information through cookies by adjusting your cookie preferences or by following the above link, you may simply re-adjust your cookie preferences.
If you have opted out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information through the use of a browser privacy control signal, you may turn off the signal and re-adjust your cookie preferences.
If you (or your Authorized Agent) submit a request to opt-in to our “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information, we will use a two-step process in order to confirm that you want to opt-in for such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. This may include confirming your choice by a popup box or other requirement to confirm your new choice.
Browser Privacy Control Signals
You may also exercise your right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the “sharing” of your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising by setting the privacy control signal on your browser, if your browser supports it. We currently recognize and support the following privacy signals sent by browsers:
Global privacy control (for more information on how to configure your browser to send this signal, please see https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).
When we receive one of these privacy control signals, we will opt you out of any further “sales” or “sharing” of your Personal Information when you interact with our websites or applications through that browser and on that device. We will only be able to propagate your choice to opt-out to your account if you are currently logged in when we receive the privacy control signal from your browser. When we are able to propagate your choice to your account, you will be opted out of “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information on all browsers and devices on which you are logged in, and for both online and offline “sales” and “sharing.”
Your Choices Regarding our Use and Disclosure of Your Sensitive Personal Information
As further described below, we do not use or disclose your Sensitive Personal Information for any purpose other than the following:

To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that our use of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for such purposes;

To perform services on behalf of us, such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage, or providing similar services on behalf of us; and
To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.
Financial Incentives
We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CPRA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CPRA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

1. Who We Are
This Notice is made by Ravelin Technology Ltd (“
Ravelin
”, “
we
” or “
us
”). Our registered office is located at Bentima House 168–172, Old Street, LONDON, EC1V 9BP, United Kingdom.
2. What We Do
Ravelin provides businesses (our “
Retailers
” or “
Customers
”) solutions to detect and address online fraud and other malicious behaviours through integrating fraud prevention and authentication services (the “
Services
”) into their websites and mobile applications (“
Retailer Platforms
”). To provide these services, it is necessary for us to gather and handle information about the end users of Retailer Platforms (“
End
Users
”).
3. How We Source Your Personal Data
Most of the End User personal data that we process has been directly provided to us through interfaces with Retailer Platforms for the purposes of predicting and preventing fraudulent and/or other malicious activity in real time. These checks require them and us to process personal data about you.
Ravelin also collects personal data about End Users, from third parties. These third parties include publicly available source and our service providers (information exchanges, and data enrichment providers) to support the provision of our services in a number of ways:
To identify suspicious activities (e.g. online identifiers match those of a known fraudster);
To analyse behavioural patterns (e.g. an End Users browser location suddenly changes, or transaction from an unusual location or at an unusual time of day);
To verify End User information (e.g. Third party data can assist with verifying a user during account creation).
The use of third-party data provides a comprehensive view of user activity and helps us identify and prevent online fraud – this also provides the End Users with the following benefits:
Protection from financial losses – Ravelin helps to protect End Users from financial losses by detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions
Increased security – the Services enhance the security of the End User accounts by detecting suspicious activity and using it to verify the legitimacy of a transaction; and
A quicker checkout process – Our checks minimise the impact to End Users as transactions are queried when marked for review.
Retailers have control over the information they share with us – to see the types of information they may share, please see the next section.
Retailers are responsible for ensuring and maintaining compliance with their own transparency requirements and applicable terms in connection with their use of our Services. Ravelin does not control these settings, so we encourage you to check the information on the Retailer platform directly to ensure you are aware of any relevant information and to update your preferences.
4. Categories of Personal Data We Process, Our Purposes for Processing, the Lawful Bases, and any Special Conditions
The categories of personal data that we may process about you and our purposes for doing so are set out in the table below.

5. Automated Decisions
We collect and process your data, alongside relevant metadata that can help improve our machine learning algorithms. These are necessary for us to provide the Services to Retailers. By using machine learning, we can give Retailers fraud risk scores and provide evidence, reports, insights, and analysis based on patterns we find in the data.
Our platform has been designed to ensure that humans can intervene where necessary when making decisions based on our automated data processing. A fraud risk score is a measure of how likely a particular event, like a transaction, refund, or use of a promotional code, is to involve fraud or other malicious activity. Retailers use our Services to help prevent fraudulent activity on their platforms. For example, a fraud risk score can be used to decide whether to accept, challenge, or reject an online order.
Although our platform may provide a recommendation, it is up to the Retailer to determine how they wish to use that recommendation. Ravelin does not have any authority over this decision-making process. Please direct any questions concerning automated decision-making to the Retailer directly.
6. Sharing Data
The purposes for which we share personal data relating to End Users with trusted third parties are set out below.
A) Service providers
To ensure effective provision of services by our third-party service providers, vendors, and contractors, we may need to share some of your information with them. This limited sharing of information is necessary for them to provide their services to us, such as hosting our infrastructure.
B) Retailers
We may share data about you with Retailers - for example, where Ravelin is providing the Services to a Retailer you have placed an order with or where you have requested access to your personal data from a Retailer.
C) Data enrichment providers
We may share minimal data about you with third party providers who then enrich data – for example, email addresses or IP addresses. Enriching data enhances the information we have and enables us to make more informed fraud risk assessments and optimise order acceptance for Retailers and End Users. Any information shared with a data enrichment provider will only be used to perform the services they provide and will be shared in compliance with this Notice and any applicable laws.
D) Retailers’ vendors or other service providers
We may share your information with third party vendors, service providers or other third party contractors of Retailers, strictly where sharing the information is necessary to provide the Services - for example, sending data to the issuing or acquiring bank involved in a transaction.
E) Professional advisors
We may disclose your personal data to our professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers but only where strictly necessary in the course of the professional services they are providing to us.
F) Legal purposes
We may disclose your information where we believe it is required by law or in order to exercise our legal rights - for example, we may share your data with a competent law enforcement body, government agency, court or other third party.
G) Corporate affiliates
We may share your information with Ravelin affiliates (any subsidiary, parent company or company under common control) as necessary to perform the Services and only for the purposes described in this Notice. If Ravelin is involved in an acquisition, merger or sale of its business or assets, your information may be shared or transferred as part of that transaction.
Data Storage, Transfers and Retention
Your personal data may be transferred, processed, and stored in the United Kingdom, United States, Belgium and other countries. We may also process information using cloud services. These countries may have different data protection and privacy laws to the laws of your country and may provide a different level of protection than in your jurisdiction, however Ravelin takes the necessary steps to ensure that your data is always processed in accordance with this Notice and in line with the requirements of applicable laws.
If you are a resident in the EEA or Switzerland, we will protect your personal data when it is transferred out of your jurisdiction by ensuring that the party receiving the data is either based in a territory which has an adequate level of protection as determined by the relevant authority or using appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data, such as the standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission. For the UK residents` data, we will rely on the standard contractual clauses issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).
We will retain your personal data where we have an ongoing legitimate legal reason to keep it and for a length of time consistent with the original purpose it was collected for. The appropriate retention period for personal data will depend on a number of factors including, the reason why it was collected, the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data. We will also consider any applicable legal requirements in relation to data retention.
After data is no longer required for the purpose it was collected for or where you have requested for us to delete the data that we hold about you (unless it is still required to be kept by us and a valid exemption applies), we will either delete or anonymise your personal data. If this is not possible (for example, where the data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until it is possible to delete it.
7. Your Rights
Residents of the UK, EEA, or Switzerland
In any circumstances where we have relied on your consent to process your personal data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdrew your consent. You also have the following rights:
to obtain access to your personal data - you may request information on how your personal data is handled by us and request a copy of such personal data;
to request us to correct or update your personal data if it is inaccurate or out of date;
to object to the processing of your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests, unless we:
demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds which override your right to object, or
the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
to erase your personal data held by us:
which are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected,
to the processing of which you object, or
which may have been unlawfully processed by us;
to restrict processing by us, i.e. the processing will be limited to storage only:
where you oppose deletion of your personal data and prefer restriction of processing instead, or
where you object to the processing by us on the basis of its legitimate interests; and
to transmit personal data you submitted to us back to you or to another organisation in certain circumstances.
to have a right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing;
Automated decision-making refers to a decision made entirely by automated means without any input from humans. Retailers can use this technology to make decisions about orders or refunds without involving humans. If a decision made by automation is challenged and requires human review, the retailer should always be contacted directly for assistance.
Please note, these rights are not absolute and are subject to various conditions under:
applicable data protection and privacy legislation; and
the laws and regulations to which we are subject.
Should you wish to exercise the rights accorded to you by data protection laws as described out above, please contact us via the means identified below in section entitled ‘
Contact Information
’. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues, for example, if you are not happy with how Ravelin processes your personal data or we fail to provide you with a satisfactory resolution to your request.
The UK supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), whose website is available at

Nasty Gal was founded by Sophia Amoruso 15 years ago in a tiny San Francisco apartment stacked with killer vintage discoveries, a single laptop, and an eBay account.

Your Rights
You have several rights under the data privacy legislation. This includes, under certain circumstances, the right to:
request access to your personal data
request correction of your personal data
request erasure of your personal data
request restriction of processing of your personal data
request the transfer of your personal data
object to processing of your personal data
request human intervention for automated decision making
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email us at DPO@prettylittlething.com..
Request access to your personal data
You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain information relating to our processing of your personal data.
Request correction of your personal data
You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update your personal data at any time by logging into your
account
and updating your details directly, or by emailing us at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
.
Request erasure of your personal data
This enables you to request that PLT delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data
You have a right to ask PLT to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing is restricted, we are allowed to retain sufficient information about you to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.
Request the transfer of your personal data
You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to another company. Please note though that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you.
Object to processing of your personal data
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we believe we have a legitimate interest in processing it (as explained above). You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms.
Request human intervention for automated decision making and profiling
You have the right to request human intervention where we are carrying out automated decision making when processing your personal data. This form of processing is permitted where it is necessary as part of our contract with you, providing that appropriate safeguards are in place or your explicit consent has been obtained.
We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Right to lodge a complaint
If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the way in which we process your data, please email us directly at DPO@prettylittlething.com. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK) or (if you are located in the European Union) any other competent supervisory authority in your country of residence (a list of supervisory authorities can be found here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO or any other supervisory authority, so please do contact us in the first instance.
Your data and countries outside of Europe
The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") using legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.
              Whenever we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. This may include using specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in Europe. More information about these is available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087
              Please contact us if you want further information on the countries to which we may transfer personal data and the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the EEA.
How long we keep your data for

To Whom Do We Sell or Share Your Personal Information
We do not sell Personal Information as the term “sell” is commonly understood to require an exchange for money. However, the use of advertising and analytics cookies on our Website is considered a “sale” of Personal Information as the term “sale” is broadly defined in the CPRA to include both monetary and other valuable consideration. Our “sale” is limited to our use of third-party advertising and analytics cookies and their use in providing behavioral advertising and their use in understanding how people use and interact with our website(s) and applications. Our “sales” of your Personal Information in this matter is subject to your right to opt-out of those sales (see Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of your Personal Information).
“Sharing” of Your Personal Information for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising
PLT may “share” your Personal Information for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, subject to your right to opt-out of that sharing (see Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of your Personal Information). Our “sharing” for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising would be limited to our use of third-party advertising cookies and their use in providing you cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., advertising on other websites or in other mediums). When the recipients of your Personal Information disclosed for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising are also permitted to use your Personal Information to provide advertising to others, we also consider this disclosure as a “sale” for monetary or other valuable consideration under the CPRA.
In the preceding twelve (12) months, PLT has “sold” for monetary or other valuable consideration, or “shared” for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, the following categories of Personal Information to the following categories of third parties:

Consumer Data Requests
The CPRA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. You may exercise these rights yourself or through your Authorized Agent. For more information on how you or your Authorized Agent can exercise your rights, please see Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights. These rights include the right to:
Request to know the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you and how we have used it
Request access to your Personal Information.
Request correction of your Personal Information.
Request deletion of your Personal Information.
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. You also have the right to opt-out of our sale or sharing of your personal data, as described further below.
Right to Know.
You have the right to request that PLT disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months (a “Right to Know” Consumer Request).
Access to Specific Pieces of Information (Data Portability).
You also have the right to request that PLT provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, including any Personal Information that we have created or otherwise received from a third-party about you (a “Data Portability” Consumer Request).
Correction.
You have the right to request that we correct any incorrect Personal Information about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. In addition to other methods you may have to exercise this right as described below, you may review and correct some Personal Information about yourself by logging into your account page and updating your details directly.
Deletion.
You have the right to request that PLT delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights
To exercise the rights described above, please submit a request (a “Consumer Request”) to us by either:
·       Emailing us at DPO@prettylittlething.com
·       Writing to us at: Boohoo Group Legal Team, 8431 Melrose Place, Los Angeles, USA
If you fail to make your Consumer Request in accordance with the ways described above, we may either treat your request as if it had been submitted with our methods described above or provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with your request. 
              Only you, or your Authorized Agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Consumer Request related to your Personal Information. To designate an Authorized Agent, see Authorized Agents below.
All Consumer Requests must:
·       Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an Authorized Agent of such a person. This may include:
·       Verifying Personal Information that we may already have about you, such as prior order numbers, address / ZIP code, and other similar information.
·       Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm which Personal Information relates to you or the individual for whom you are making the request as their Authorized Agent. 
              Making a Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
              We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. 
              For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information.
Authorized Agents
You may authorize your agent to exercise your rights under the CPRA on your behalf by registering your agent with the California Secretary of State or by providing them with power of attorney to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable laws (an “Authorized Agent”). We may request that your Authorized Agent submit proof of identity and that they have been authorized exercise your rights on your behalf. We may deny a request from your Authorized Agent to exercise your rights on your behalf if they fail to submit adequate proof of identity or adequate proof that they have the authority to exercise your rights. 
              In response to a Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Request, we will provide you with all relevant information we have collected or maintained about you on or after January 1, 2022, unless an exception applies. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data Portability Consumer Request, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, such as CSV file(s) and/or PDF file(s).
              We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. We reserve the right to consider more than two (2) total Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Requests (or combination of the two) in a twelve (12) month period to be repetitive and/or excessive and require a fee. If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information
                             “Sale” of Your Personal Information
As described above, our use of cookies is considered a “sale” under the CPRA. We do not otherwise sell your Personal Information for monetary consideration. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not “sell” your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not “sell” the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information “sales” may opt-out of future “sales” at any time.
“Sharing” of Your Personal Information
If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not share your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is showing advertising on other websites or other media based on your browsing history with our websites and applications (the “right to opt-out”). We do not share the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age for this purpose, unless we receive affirmative authorization from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to our sharing of Personal Information for these purposes may opt-out of future such sharing at any time.
How You May Opt-Out of Our Sale or Sharing of Your Personal Information
To exercise the right to opt-out of the “sale” and the “sharing” your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, you may do so by any of the following: clicking the link below, adjusting your cookie preferences, or by configuring your browser to send us a privacy signal as described in more detail below. You may also opt-out of such “sales” and “sharing” by setting your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do not consent to our use of cookies or select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites or applications or other websites.

Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of Personal Information at any time by:
If you have opted out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information through cookies by adjusting your cookie preferences or by following the above link, you may simply re-adjust your cookie preferences.
If you have opted out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information through the use of a browser privacy control signal, you may turn off the signal and re-adjust your cookie preferences.
If you (or your Authorized Agent) submit a request to opt-in to our “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information, we will use a two-step process in order to confirm that you want to opt-in for such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. This may include confirming your choice by a popup box or other requirement to confirm your new choice.
Browser Privacy Control Signals
You may also exercise your right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the “sharing” of your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising by setting the privacy control signal on your browser, if your browser supports it. We currently recognize and support the following privacy signals sent by browsers:
Global privacy control (for more information on how to configure your browser to send this signal, please see https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).
When we receive one of these privacy control signals, we will opt you out of any further “sales” or “sharing” of your Personal Information when you interact with our websites or applications through that browser and on that device. We will only be able to propagate your choice to opt-out to your account if you are currently logged in when we receive the privacy control signal from your browser. When we are able to propagate your choice to your account, you will be opted out of “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information on all browsers and devices on which you are logged in, and for both online and offline “sales” and “sharing.”
