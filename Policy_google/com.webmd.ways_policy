Why We Collect and How We Use Your Information
Personal information
provided by your Sponsor
is needed to:
Authenticate you as a legitimate user of the WebMD Services;
Establish log-in credentials to provide you with secure access to your information;
Provide demographic data required by some WebMD Services; and
Provide your Sponsors with reports for the purposes of plan administration and eligibility for certain rewards (see the
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
section below).
Personal information collected
directly
from you is needed to:
Establish and control access to your WebMD account;
Allow you to track your health information and health-related behavior;
Provide personalized content, advice, and recommendations that are relevant to you and your health needs; for example, we:
Allow you to track your health and behaviors,
Give you personalized health assessments,
Send you health alerts or other health-related messages, and
Send you messages about your account;
Produce the report of statistics and aggregate information mentioned above;
Respond to questions or comments that you send to us;
Allow you to communicate with others in online health topic communities;
Communicate with you as required by law, in connection with our services and as otherwise permitted by you or your Sponsor; and
Find out how our services are being used to help us improve and know which tools users find most helpful.
Personal information collected
indirectly
from you is needed to assess and improve how users of the WebMD Services navigate and utilize the website.
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
We may disclose information about you to your Sponsor or to any third party: (a) as instructed by your Sponsor, (b) as described in the Notice of Privacy Practices that your Sponsor gave you, and (c) in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
We do provide your Sponsor with a number of reports on an aggregate and anonymous basis. Your Sponsor uses these aggregate reports to better understand and assess the health needs and concerns of its employee population, and to consider development of programs to address these needs and concerns. For example, your Sponsor might learn that there is significant interest in stopping smoking amongst employees in a particular geographic region and then introduce smoking cessation programs in those countries.
WebMD may tell your Sponsor if you have registered with WebMD, if you have taken a health assessment, or if you've signed up for WebMD programs offered by your Sponsor. We will do so to help your Sponsor manage incentives and analyze registration rates. WebMD will not share your personal information (such as the answers you give to the health assessment) in a manner that can be used to identify you with your employer; however, as described above, we may share information with your health plan for the purposes of plan administration and rewards eligibility.
Disclosures to Other Third Parties
WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide us services, including coaching services, analytics, security, and marketing. Additionally, at the direction of your Sponsor, WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide services for your Sponsor. For example, if your Sponsor provides an incentive program that is managed by a vendor (e.g., for completing a health assessment), then we may share your name, contact information, and eligibility with the vendor so that you can get your incentive. In any case, these third-party vendors are authorized only to process that information as necessary and as directed by us or your Sponsor, respectively.   We may also disclose your information to our affiliate, Limeade, Inc. (“Limeade”), for the purpose of having Limeade employees provide services to us in order to better serve you.
We may also give your personal information to other third parties under special circumstances such as:
A court order, search warrant, subpoena, or other legal purpose that we deem to be valid;
To protect our rights, your rights, or the rights of others; and
A corporate transaction that results in a transfer of the assets or line of business that holds your information.
Should any of these events occur, WebMD will attempt to notify you through the email address you provided us, unless doing so would violate a law or court order.
How We Safeguard Your Information
We use reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access and changes. All personal information you provide through the use of the WebMD Services is secured in transmission using encryption and passwords. We also use industry-standard encryption and hash algorithms in storing your personal information within our databases and in back-up files. We use firewalls and monitoring software to provide real-time protection for our servers, which are locked down using standard physical measures. We store identical information on servers at two separate locations to provide continuity of service.
We limit access to your information to help ensure that only you, our authorized personnel, and other authorized third parties can access your information as described in this Privacy Policy. All WebMD personnel are required to complete privacy and security training on a regular and refresher basis and are subject to disciplinary action for violating WebMD's information security policies.
No information system is 100% secure, and we can't guarantee that your information will be protected against all security threats.

The personal information you provide when using the WebMD Services is stored and maintained on servers owned by WebMD in data centers located in the United States.

You can stop this information from being shown on your screen when you log on; but, you can't delete information that your Sponsor gives us.
Also, your rights to view, correct, or change your personal information that are set forth in your health plan's Notice of Privacy Practices may apply to some or all of the information that we collect. Please read that notice so you know your rights and how to act on them.

Note to Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK
General Data Protection Regulation
The EU General Data Protection Regulation and UK General Data Protection Regulation (together the "GDPR") require certain information to be provided to data subjects located in the EEA and the UK, and grant them certain rights regarding their personal data. This section applies solely to the processing activities that are governed by the GDPR.
Data Controller and EEA Representative
When you access the WebMD Services, your Sponsor and WebMD are separate controllers of certain processing activities related to your personal data. WebMD has appointed Dentons Europe Consulting B.V. as its representative in the EEA. WebMD's Data Protection Officer can be contacted at privacy@webmd.com. This Privacy Policy describes how WebMD processes your personal data.
Legal Bases for Processing
We may process your personal data in order to perform a contract with you (e.g., to deliver the WebMD Services you have requested) or in order to take certain steps prior to entering into such contract. For example, we may process your personal data in the following instances:
In order to provide you with the WebMD Services, you will need to create an account with WebMD and we will need to verify you as the account owner.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may need to contact you in order to provide you with information about your account or other health management and wellbeing program services.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may provide personalized services and more relevant content to you, based on the information you provide to us and on the information that we collect as part of your use of the WebMD Services.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may provide you with information for general service and transactional purposes, such as answering your questions, administering your account, responding to your complaints, and processing your data subject rights requests.
We may offer health management and wellbeing programs as part of the WebMD Services, and in order for you to participate in these programs, we may receive certain types of data from third-party service providers engaged by us or your Sponsor. These service providers may include entities that offer biometric screenings or flu shot services.
We may also process your personal data based on our legitimate interests or on the legitimate interests of third parties, such as your Sponsor, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal data in order to:
Keep the WebMD Services safe and secure;
Comply with laws and regulations that apply to us;
Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions; and
Understand and improve the WebMD Services.
Finally, we may process your personal data when you have given us your explicit consent to such processing, particularly:
The sensitive/special category personal data you provide to us; and
When you consent to receiving newsletters, marketing materials, and other promotional offers from us.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to decline consent or withdraw your consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object.
Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the EEA and the UK
WebMD, the controller of your personal data, is located in the United States. Accordingly, your personal data is processed by WebMD in the United States.
WebMD may also transfer your personal data to third-party service providers to help us provide the WebMD Services to you. Personal data may be stored and processed in any country where WebMD has engaged service providers. If you are located in the EEA in the UK, please note that your personal data may be transferred to the United States or another country that may not be considered to have the same level of data protection as the countries in the EEA or the UK. However, please note that we have implemented appropriate safeguards by entering into standard contractual clauses with any service provider located outside the EEA and the UK.
Additionally, we participate in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework. To learn more, click
here.
Retention of Personal Data
WebMD will retain your personal data up to ninety (90) days after your account deactivation. Thereafter, the data will be archived in order to comply with applicable law or regulation that you, WebMD, or your Sponsor may be subject to, such as HIPAA, or the data will be fully anonymized.
Your Rights to Your Personal Data
Under the GDPR, and in certain circumstances, you may ask to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or port your personal data, as well as, object to the use of your personal data. To exercise these rights, or if you have any questions or comments regarding your personal data, please contact us at privacy@webmd.com.
When we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent, at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of such processing before your withdrawal. To withdraw your consent, please submit a written request to privacy@webmd.com.
For processing necessary to perform the contract, or based on our legitimate interests, we may be unable to accommodate any requests to cease such processing; or if we do accommodate such requests, you may lose access to the WebMD Services.
If you believe that we have not complied with our obligations under this Privacy Policy or the GDPR, you have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.

Editorial Integrity
Our mission is to bring you the most objective, trustworthy, and accurate health information. Our daily goal is to ensure that WebMD is your practical and relevant content source for health and medicine.
We are committed to providing information on a wide variety of health topics, and rather than filtering certain types of information that may or may not be applicable to any one individual's personal health, we rely on you, our reader, to choose the information that is most appropriate for you.   However, the original editorial information we provide is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.  Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.  Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the WebMD Site!
The following sections detail our content policies and procedures.
Editorial Selection of Original Content Created by WebMD
WebMD creates original content with reference generally to the following criteria:
Relevance
-- Issues that could affect how you manage your own health and that of your family. Topics include coverage of breaking health news; drug and product launches, recalls, and alerts; health advisories; and expert commentary on managing diseases and conditions and staying healthy.
Clinical Significance
-- The latest medical findings published in peer-reviewed medical journals, such as The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Pediatrics, Diabetes Care, Circulation, and many others.
Trends
-- Seasonal interests, such as "Summer Safety", "Allergy Seasons", and "Cold and Flu"; public health awareness, such as "Breast Cancer Awareness Month" and "Healthy Heart Month"; and emerging health trends, such as the latest in nutrition, fitness, disease prevention, healthy living, alternative approaches, and much more.
Our Content Is Different
It's more reliable. In a medium often accused of providing outdated and inaccurate information, WebMD stands out as a credible, authoritative source of health information.
Our news and feature stories are based on our editors' selections of the most important and relevant health events occurring on a given day. Our news articles are more than a short summary of a study or an event.

You can stop our apps from providing location information about you by changing the location settings on your mobile device.
The information we collect when you use our apps is governed by this Privacy Policy.
Why We Collect and How We Use Your Information
Personal information
provided by your Sponsor
is needed to:
Authenticate you as a legitimate user of the WebMD Services;
Establish log-in credentials to provide you with secure access to your information;
Provide demographic data required by some WebMD Services; and
Provide your Sponsors with reports for the purposes of plan administration and eligibility for certain rewards (see the
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
section below).
Personal information collected
directly
from you is needed to:
Establish and control access to your WebMD account;
Allow you to track your health information and health-related behavior;
Provide personalized content, advice, and recommendations that are relevant to you and your health needs; for example, we:
Allow you to track your health and behaviors,
Give you personalized health assessments,
Send you health alerts or other health-related messages, and
Send you messages about your account;
Produce the report of statistics and aggregate information mentioned above;
Respond to questions or comments that you send to us;
Allow you to communicate with others in online health topic communities;
Communicate with you as required by law, in connection with our services and as otherwise permitted by you or your Sponsor; and
Find out how our services are being used to help us improve and know which tools users find most helpful.
Personal information collected
indirectly
from you is needed to assess and improve how users of the WebMD Services navigate and utilize the website.
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
We may disclose information about you to your Sponsor or to any third party: (a) as instructed by your Sponsor, (b) as described in the Notice of Privacy Practices that your Sponsor gave you, and (c) in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
We do provide your Sponsor with a number of reports on an aggregate and anonymous basis. Your Sponsor uses these aggregate reports to better understand and assess the health needs and concerns of its employee population, and to consider development of programs to address these needs and concerns. For example, your Sponsor might learn that there is significant interest in stopping smoking amongst employees in a particular geographic region and then introduce smoking cessation programs in those countries.
WebMD may tell your Sponsor if you have registered with WebMD, if you have taken a health assessment, or if you've signed up for WebMD programs offered by your Sponsor. We will do so to help your Sponsor manage incentives and analyze registration rates. WebMD will not share your personal information (such as the answers you give to the health assessment) in a manner that can be used to identify you with your employer; however, as described above, we may share information with your health plan for the purposes of plan administration and rewards eligibility.
Disclosures to Other Third Parties
WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide us services, including coaching services, analytics, security, and marketing. Additionally, at the direction of your Sponsor, WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide services for your Sponsor. For example, if your Sponsor provides an incentive program that is managed by a vendor (e.g., for completing a health assessment), then we may share your name, contact information, and eligibility with the vendor so that you can get your incentive. In any case, these third-party vendors are authorized only to process that information as necessary and as directed by us or your Sponsor, respectively.   We may also disclose your information to our affiliate, Limeade, Inc. (“Limeade”), for the purpose of having Limeade employees provide services to us in order to better serve you.
We may also give your personal information to other third parties under special circumstances such as:
A court order, search warrant, subpoena, or other legal purpose that we deem to be valid;
To protect our rights, your rights, or the rights of others; and
A corporate transaction that results in a transfer of the assets or line of business that holds your information.
Should any of these events occur, WebMD will attempt to notify you through the email address you provided us, unless doing so would violate a law or court order.
How We Safeguard Your Information
We use reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access and changes. All personal information you provide through the use of the WebMD Services is secured in transmission using encryption and passwords. We also use industry-standard encryption and hash algorithms in storing your personal information within our databases and in back-up files. We use firewalls and monitoring software to provide real-time protection for our servers, which are locked down using standard physical measures. We store identical information on servers at two separate locations to provide continuity of service.
We limit access to your information to help ensure that only you, our authorized personnel, and other authorized third parties can access your information as described in this Privacy Policy. All WebMD personnel are required to complete privacy and security training on a regular and refresher basis and are subject to disciplinary action for violating WebMD's information security policies.
No information system is 100% secure, and we can't guarantee that your information will be protected against all security threats.
Storage of Your Information
The personal information you provide when using the WebMD Services is stored and maintained on servers owned by WebMD in data centers located in the United States.
Your Access and Correction Rights
When you log in to this website, you can view, change, and delete personal information that you have entered on this website.

You can stop this information from being shown on your screen when you log on; but, you can't delete information that your Sponsor gives us.
Also, your rights to view, correct, or change your personal information that are set forth in your health plan's Notice of Privacy Practices may apply to some or all of the information that we collect. Please read that notice so you know your rights and how to act on them.
Your Account Deletion Rights
You may close your WebMD account and remove personal information from your account. To do this, you can either:
Go to the "Account Deletion" tab under "Settings" on this website's home page and follow the on-screen instructions to delete your account; or

privacy@webmd.com
or by submitting a request through the "Feedback" option at the bottom of the log-in page.
If you delete your account and personal information, your Sponsor may decide that you are not eligible for incentives and your account access, gained through your Sponsor, will end immediately.
If You Separate from Your Sponsor or Your Account Is Cancelled
Certain events may cause you to lose access to your WebMD account. For example, you may change jobs or health plans, or the contract between WebMD and your Sponsor may end. When we know that you no longer have access, WebMD will shut down your account and your personal information will be stored and subsequently removed in keeping with our data destruction schedule. You may be able to access your information after your account is shut down if your Sponsor has allowed portable personal health records.

Note to Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK
General Data Protection Regulation
The EU General Data Protection Regulation and UK General Data Protection Regulation (together the "GDPR") require certain information to be provided to data subjects located in the EEA and the UK, and grant them certain rights regarding their personal data. This section applies solely to the processing activities that are governed by the GDPR.
Data Controller and EEA Representative
When you access the WebMD Services, your Sponsor and WebMD are separate controllers of certain processing activities related to your personal data. WebMD has appointed Dentons Europe Consulting B.V. as its representative in the EEA. WebMD's Data Protection Officer can be contacted at privacy@webmd.com. This Privacy Policy describes how WebMD processes your personal data.
Legal Bases for Processing
We may process your personal data in order to perform a contract with you (e.g., to deliver the WebMD Services you have requested) or in order to take certain steps prior to entering into such contract. For example, we may process your personal data in the following instances:
In order to provide you with the WebMD Services, you will need to create an account with WebMD and we will need to verify you as the account owner.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may need to contact you in order to provide you with information about your account or other health management and wellbeing program services.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may provide personalized services and more relevant content to you, based on the information you provide to us and on the information that we collect as part of your use of the WebMD Services.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may provide you with information for general service and transactional purposes, such as answering your questions, administering your account, responding to your complaints, and processing your data subject rights requests.
We may offer health management and wellbeing programs as part of the WebMD Services, and in order for you to participate in these programs, we may receive certain types of data from third-party service providers engaged by us or your Sponsor. These service providers may include entities that offer biometric screenings or flu shot services.
We may also process your personal data based on our legitimate interests or on the legitimate interests of third parties, such as your Sponsor, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal data in order to:
Keep the WebMD Services safe and secure;
Comply with laws and regulations that apply to us;
Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions; and
Understand and improve the WebMD Services.
Finally, we may process your personal data when you have given us your explicit consent to such processing, particularly:
The sensitive/special category personal data you provide to us; and
When you consent to receiving newsletters, marketing materials, and other promotional offers from us.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to decline consent or withdraw your consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object.
Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the EEA and the UK
WebMD, the controller of your personal data, is located in the United States. Accordingly, your personal data is processed by WebMD in the United States.
WebMD may also transfer your personal data to third-party service providers to help us provide the WebMD Services to you. Personal data may be stored and processed in any country where WebMD has engaged service providers. If you are located in the EEA in the UK, please note that your personal data may be transferred to the United States or another country that may not be considered to have the same level of data protection as the countries in the EEA or the UK. However, please note that we have implemented appropriate safeguards by entering into standard contractual clauses with any service provider located outside the EEA and the UK.
Additionally, we participate in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework. To learn more, click
here.
Retention of Personal Data
WebMD will retain your personal data up to ninety (90) days after your account deactivation. Thereafter, the data will be archived in order to comply with applicable law or regulation that you, WebMD, or your Sponsor may be subject to, such as HIPAA, or the data will be fully anonymized.
Your Rights to Your Personal Data
Under the GDPR, and in certain circumstances, you may ask to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or port your personal data, as well as, object to the use of your personal data. To exercise these rights, or if you have any questions or comments regarding your personal data, please contact us at privacy@webmd.com.
When we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent, at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of such processing before your withdrawal. To withdraw your consent, please submit a written request to privacy@webmd.com.
For processing necessary to perform the contract, or based on our legitimate interests, we may be unable to accommodate any requests to cease such processing; or if we do accommodate such requests, you may lose access to the WebMD Services.
If you believe that we have not complied with our obligations under this Privacy Policy or the GDPR, you have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.
Do You Need to Provide Personal Data?
We need to process your personal data in order to provide you with the WebMD Services. If you do not want to provide any personal data, you may not enjoy all or part of the WebMD Services.
Automated Decision-Making
WebMD does not make automated decisions that create legal effects or otherwise significantly affect you.
Our Safeguards and Security Measures
We have implemented technology and security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction, and accidental loss. For more information, please refer to the
How We Safeguard Your Information
section above.
By using the WebMD Services or providing personal information to us, you acknowledge that we may communicate with you electronically about any security, privacy, or administrative issues relating to your use of the WebMD Services. If You have any reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us immediately at privacy@webmd.com.
Your Health Plan's Notice of Privacy Practices
You should know that your health plan has a Notice of Privacy Practices, which includes policies for use and disclosure of your information, including information that you provide to WebMD.
This is managed by your health plan, not by WebMD, so we aren't able to let you know of changes or updates. If you would like to read a copy of your health plan's Notice of Privacy Practices, please ask your Sponsor or your plan for a copy.

We may change parts of this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes take effect at the time they are posted unless otherwise noted.

is needed to:
Authenticate you as a legitimate user of the WebMD Services;
Establish log-in credentials to provide you with secure access to your information;
Provide demographic data required by some WebMD Services; and
Provide your Sponsors with reports for the purposes of plan administration and eligibility for certain rewards (see the
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
section below).
Personal information collected
directly
from you is needed to:
Establish and control access to your WebMD account;
Allow you to track your health information and health-related behavior;
Provide personalized content, advice, and recommendations that are relevant to you and your health needs; for example, we:
Allow you to track your health and behaviors,
Give you personalized health assessments,
Send you health alerts or other health-related messages, and
Send you messages about your account;
Produce the report of statistics and aggregate information mentioned above;
Respond to questions or comments that you send to us;
Allow you to communicate with others in online health topic communities;
Communicate with you as required by law, in connection with our services and as otherwise permitted by you or your Sponsor; and
Find out how our services are being used to help us improve and know which tools users find most helpful.
Personal information collected
indirectly
from you is needed to assess and improve how users of the WebMD Services navigate and utilize the website.
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
We may disclose information about you to your Sponsor or to any third party: (a) as instructed by your Sponsor, (b) as described in the Notice of Privacy Practices that your Sponsor gave you, and (c) in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
We do provide your Sponsor with a number of reports on an aggregate and anonymous basis. Your Sponsor uses these aggregate reports to better understand and assess the health needs and concerns of its employee population, and to consider development of programs to address these needs and concerns. For example, your Sponsor might learn that there is significant interest in stopping smoking amongst employees in a particular geographic region and then introduce smoking cessation programs in those countries.
WebMD may tell your Sponsor if you have registered with WebMD, if you have taken a health assessment, or if you've signed up for WebMD programs offered by your Sponsor. We will do so to help your Sponsor manage incentives and analyze registration rates. WebMD will not share your personal information (such as the answers you give to the health assessment) in a manner that can be used to identify you with your employer; however, as described above, we may share information with your health plan for the purposes of plan administration and rewards eligibility.
Disclosures to Other Third Parties
WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide us services, including coaching services, analytics, security, and marketing. Additionally, at the direction of your Sponsor, WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide services for your Sponsor. For example, if your Sponsor provides an incentive program that is managed by a vendor (e.g., for completing a health assessment), then we may share your name, contact information, and eligibility with the vendor so that you can get your incentive. In any case, these third-party vendors are authorized only to process that information as necessary and as directed by us or your Sponsor, respectively.   We may also disclose your information to our affiliate, Limeade, Inc. (“Limeade”), for the purpose of having Limeade employees provide services to us in order to better serve you.
We may also give your personal information to other third parties under special circumstances such as:
A court order, search warrant, subpoena, or other legal purpose that we deem to be valid;
To protect our rights, your rights, or the rights of others; and
A corporate transaction that results in a transfer of the assets or line of business that holds your information.
Should any of these events occur, WebMD will attempt to notify you through the email address you provided us, unless doing so would violate a law or court order.
How We Safeguard Your Information
We use reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access and changes. All personal information you provide through the use of the WebMD Services is secured in transmission using encryption and passwords. We also use industry-standard encryption and hash algorithms in storing your personal information within our databases and in back-up files. We use firewalls and monitoring software to provide real-time protection for our servers, which are locked down using standard physical measures. We store identical information on servers at two separate locations to provide continuity of service.
We limit access to your information to help ensure that only you, our authorized personnel, and other authorized third parties can access your information as described in this Privacy Policy. All WebMD personnel are required to complete privacy and security training on a regular and refresher basis and are subject to disciplinary action for violating WebMD's information security policies.
No information system is 100% secure, and we can't guarantee that your information will be protected against all security threats.

The personal information you provide when using the WebMD Services is stored and maintained on servers owned by WebMD in data centers located in the United States.

You can stop this information from being shown on your screen when you log on; but, you can't delete information that your Sponsor gives us.
Also, your rights to view, correct, or change your personal information that are set forth in your health plan's Notice of Privacy Practices may apply to some or all of the information that we collect. Please read that notice so you know your rights and how to act on them.

Editorial Integrity
Our mission is to bring you the most objective, trustworthy, and accurate health information. Our daily goal is to ensure that WebMD is your practical and relevant content source for health and medicine.
We are committed to providing information on a wide variety of health topics, and rather than filtering certain types of information that may or may not be applicable to any one individual's personal health, we rely on you, our reader, to choose the information that is most appropriate for you.   However, the original editorial information we provide is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.  Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.  Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the WebMD Site!
The following sections detail our content policies and procedures.
Editorial Selection of Original Content Created by WebMD
WebMD creates original content with reference generally to the following criteria:
Relevance
-- Issues that could affect how you manage your own health and that of your family. Topics include coverage of breaking health news; drug and product launches, recalls, and alerts; health advisories; and expert commentary on managing diseases and conditions and staying healthy.
Clinical Significance
-- The latest medical findings published in peer-reviewed medical journals, such as The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Pediatrics, Diabetes Care, Circulation, and many others.
Trends
-- Seasonal interests, such as "Summer Safety", "Allergy Seasons", and "Cold and Flu"; public health awareness, such as "Breast Cancer Awareness Month" and "Healthy Heart Month"; and emerging health trends, such as the latest in nutrition, fitness, disease prevention, healthy living, alternative approaches, and much more.
Our Content Is Different
It's more reliable. In a medium often accused of providing outdated and inaccurate information, WebMD stands out as a credible, authoritative source of health information.
Our news and feature stories are based on our editors' selections of the most important and relevant health events occurring on a given day. Our news articles are more than a short summary of a study or an event. They often contain interviews with the medical researchers who authored them, plus interviews with objective experts who can put the research into context and tell the reader what it means in today's world.
Editorial Integrity
-- WebMD's journalistic responsibility is to make a clear distinction between news, features, reference, and other editorial information, so that individuals can readily distinguish independent editorial information from advertising.
Editorial Independence
-- In its reporting, WebMD maintains exemplary principles of fairness, accuracy, objectivity, and responsible, independent reporting.  WebMD maintains sole control of its editorial content.
Journalistic Excellence
-- WebMD upholds traditional journalistic principles of excellence in reporting original news for the Internet and in reviewing and corroborating information from other sources. Our content continues to win awards and recognitions in journalistic excellence and you can see our most current list of awards by checking our Awards page.
Health Equity
-- WebMD is dedicated to creating content by and for all people and to helping close health equity gaps.
Editorial Policy for WebMD Editorial Staff
WebMD is the leading provider of health information services, serving consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals. Editorial content created by WebMD is free from influence by advertisers and other sources.
Anyone who serves on the WebMD Editorial staff must fully disclose any potential conflict of interest with any sponsor or vendor.
The WebMD Editorial staff is charged with the responsibility of providing objective, accurate, and balanced accounts of events and issues. WebMD reporters must diligently seek out subjects of stories or qualified experts to provide commentary. They also seek objective commentary or comment from a qualified spokesperson to provide balance.
WebMD journalists strive to provide thorough and honest coverage and share a dedication to the highest professional standards.
Original Content Process
The content that we produce and the news that we feature is determined by our staff of physicians and medical journalists. It contains the latest information from reliable sources including the most important peer-reviewed medical journals, announcements from federal health agencies, and analyses on the latest health trends. Our experienced health reporters talk daily with prominent medical leaders, providing in-depth analyses, updates, and profiles that give our health news and content a perspective found nowhere else. Every original article is reviewed by our staff of full-time, board-certified physician editors.
Third parties may provide funding to WebMD for the creation by WebMD of original editorial content for the WebMD Network. In such cases, the third party may work with WebMD to  identify a mutually agreed upon general topic, but the content will be produced in accordance with our Original Content Process and the third party will have no control over the content. At their request, these third parties may receive the attribution "Supported by [third party's name]" on our editorial content during the period that they fund a program. This attribution is not intended to reflect any change in the editorial nature of the content.
Each completed story to be published is reviewed by a physician editor for accuracy, appropriateness of medical language, and proper characterization of the findings. The story is next reviewed by an Editorial editor who edits it for style, flow, punctuation, and readability. Finally, the story moves from editing to publishing to the site.
Licensed and Third Party Content
When WebMD licenses health and wellness content from third-parties for publication on our site, the WebMD senior Editorial editors and physician editors review the third-party's editorial policies and procedures for consistency with the WebMD Editorial Policies.

Provide demographic data required by some WebMD Services; and
Provide your Sponsors with reports for the purposes of plan administration and eligibility for certain rewards (see the
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
section below).

Establish and control access to your WebMD account;
Allow you to track your health information and health-related behavior;
Provide personalized content, advice, and recommendations that are relevant to you and your health needs; for example, we:
Allow you to track your health and behaviors,

Find out how our services are being used to help us improve and know which tools users find most helpful.
Personal information collected
indirectly
from you is needed to assess and improve how users of the WebMD Services navigate and utilize the website.
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
We may disclose information about you to your Sponsor or to any third party: (a) as instructed by your Sponsor, (b) as described in the Notice of Privacy Practices that your Sponsor gave you, and (c) in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
We do provide your Sponsor with a number of reports on an aggregate and anonymous basis. Your Sponsor uses these aggregate reports to better understand and assess the health needs and concerns of its employee population, and to consider development of programs to address these needs and concerns. For example, your Sponsor might learn that there is significant interest in stopping smoking amongst employees in a particular geographic region and then introduce smoking cessation programs in those countries.
WebMD may tell your Sponsor if you have registered with WebMD, if you have taken a health assessment, or if you've signed up for WebMD programs offered by your Sponsor. We will do so to help your Sponsor manage incentives and analyze registration rates. WebMD will not share your personal information (such as the answers you give to the health assessment) in a manner that can be used to identify you with your employer; however, as described above, we may share information with your health plan for the purposes of plan administration and rewards eligibility.
Disclosures to Other Third Parties
WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide us services, including coaching services, analytics, security, and marketing. Additionally, at the direction of your Sponsor, WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide services for your Sponsor. For example, if your Sponsor provides an incentive program that is managed by a vendor (e.g., for completing a health assessment), then we may share your name, contact information, and eligibility with the vendor so that you can get your incentive. In any case, these third-party vendors are authorized only to process that information as necessary and as directed by us or your Sponsor, respectively.   We may also disclose your information to our affiliate, Limeade, Inc. (“Limeade”), for the purpose of having Limeade employees provide services to us in order to better serve you.
We may also give your personal information to other third parties under special circumstances such as:
A court order, search warrant, subpoena, or other legal purpose that we deem to be valid;
To protect our rights, your rights, or the rights of others; and
A corporate transaction that results in a transfer of the assets or line of business that holds your information.
Should any of these events occur, WebMD will attempt to notify you through the email address you provided us, unless doing so would violate a law or court order.
How We Safeguard Your Information
We use reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access and changes. All personal information you provide through the use of the WebMD Services is secured in transmission using encryption and passwords. We also use industry-standard encryption and hash algorithms in storing your personal information within our databases and in back-up files. We use firewalls and monitoring software to provide real-time protection for our servers, which are locked down using standard physical measures. We store identical information on servers at two separate locations to provide continuity of service.
We limit access to your information to help ensure that only you, our authorized personnel, and other authorized third parties can access your information as described in this Privacy Policy. All WebMD personnel are required to complete privacy and security training on a regular and refresher basis and are subject to disciplinary action for violating WebMD's information security policies.
No information system is 100% secure, and we can't guarantee that your information will be protected against all security threats.

You can stop this information from being shown on your screen when you log on; but, you can't delete information that your Sponsor gives us.

Note to Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK
General Data Protection Regulation
The EU General Data Protection Regulation and UK General Data Protection Regulation (together the "GDPR") require certain information to be provided to data subjects located in the EEA and the UK, and grant them certain rights regarding their personal data. This section applies solely to the processing activities that are governed by the GDPR.
Data Controller and EEA Representative
When you access the WebMD Services, your Sponsor and WebMD are separate controllers of certain processing activities related to your personal data. WebMD has appointed Dentons Europe Consulting B.V. as its representative in the EEA. WebMD's Data Protection Officer can be contacted at privacy@webmd.com. This Privacy Policy describes how WebMD processes your personal data.
Legal Bases for Processing
We may process your personal data in order to perform a contract with you (e.g., to deliver the WebMD Services you have requested) or in order to take certain steps prior to entering into such contract. For example, we may process your personal data in the following instances:
In order to provide you with the WebMD Services, you will need to create an account with WebMD and we will need to verify you as the account owner.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may need to contact you in order to provide you with information about your account or other health management and wellbeing program services.

As part of the WebMD Services, we may provide you with information for general service and transactional purposes, such as answering your questions, administering your account, responding to your complaints, and processing your data subject rights requests.
We may offer health management and wellbeing programs as part of the WebMD Services, and in order for you to participate in these programs, we may receive certain types of data from third-party service providers engaged by us or your Sponsor. These service providers may include entities that offer biometric screenings or flu shot services.

Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the EEA and the UK
WebMD, the controller of your personal data, is located in the United States. Accordingly, your personal data is processed by WebMD in the United States.
WebMD may also transfer your personal data to third-party service providers to help us provide the WebMD Services to you. Personal data may be stored and processed in any country where WebMD has engaged service providers. If you are located in the EEA in the UK, please note that your personal data may be transferred to the United States or another country that may not be considered to have the same level of data protection as the countries in the EEA or the UK. However, please note that we have implemented appropriate safeguards by entering into standard contractual clauses with any service provider located outside the EEA and the UK.

Retention of Personal Data
WebMD will retain your personal data up to ninety (90) days after your account deactivation. Thereafter, the data will be archived in order to comply with applicable law or regulation that you, WebMD, or your Sponsor may be subject to, such as HIPAA, or the data will be fully anonymized.
Your Rights to Your Personal Data
Under the GDPR, and in certain circumstances, you may ask to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or port your personal data, as well as, object to the use of your personal data. To exercise these rights, or if you have any questions or comments regarding your personal data, please contact us at privacy@webmd.com.
When we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent, at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of such processing before your withdrawal. To withdraw your consent, please submit a written request to privacy@webmd.com.
For processing necessary to perform the contract, or based on our legitimate interests, we may be unable to accommodate any requests to cease such processing; or if we do accommodate such requests, you may lose access to the WebMD Services.

Why We Collect and How We Use Your Information
Personal information
provided by your Sponsor
is needed to:
Authenticate you as a legitimate user of the WebMD Services;
Establish log-in credentials to provide you with secure access to your information;
Provide demographic data required by some WebMD Services; and
Provide your Sponsors with reports for the purposes of plan administration and eligibility for certain rewards (see the
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
section below).
Personal information collected
directly
from you is needed to:
Establish and control access to your WebMD account;
Allow you to track your health information and health-related behavior;
Provide personalized content, advice, and recommendations that are relevant to you and your health needs; for example, we:
Allow you to track your health and behaviors,
Give you personalized health assessments,
Send you health alerts or other health-related messages, and
Send you messages about your account;
Produce the report of statistics and aggregate information mentioned above;
Respond to questions or comments that you send to us;
Allow you to communicate with others in online health topic communities;
Communicate with you as required by law, in connection with our services and as otherwise permitted by you or your Sponsor; and
Find out how our services are being used to help us improve and know which tools users find most helpful.
Personal information collected
indirectly
from you is needed to assess and improve how users of the WebMD Services navigate and utilize the website.
Disclosures to Your Sponsor
We may disclose information about you to your Sponsor or to any third party: (a) as instructed by your Sponsor, (b) as described in the Notice of Privacy Practices that your Sponsor gave you, and (c) in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
We do provide your Sponsor with a number of reports on an aggregate and anonymous basis. Your Sponsor uses these aggregate reports to better understand and assess the health needs and concerns of its employee population, and to consider development of programs to address these needs and concerns. For example, your Sponsor might learn that there is significant interest in stopping smoking amongst employees in a particular geographic region and then introduce smoking cessation programs in those countries.
WebMD may tell your Sponsor if you have registered with WebMD, if you have taken a health assessment, or if you've signed up for WebMD programs offered by your Sponsor. We will do so to help your Sponsor manage incentives and analyze registration rates. WebMD will not share your personal information (such as the answers you give to the health assessment) in a manner that can be used to identify you with your employer; however, as described above, we may share information with your health plan for the purposes of plan administration and rewards eligibility.
Disclosures to Other Third Parties
WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide us services, including coaching services, analytics, security, and marketing. Additionally, at the direction of your Sponsor, WebMD may give your personal information to third-party vendors that provide services for your Sponsor. For example, if your Sponsor provides an incentive program that is managed by a vendor (e.g., for completing a health assessment), then we may share your name, contact information, and eligibility with the vendor so that you can get your incentive. In any case, these third-party vendors are authorized only to process that information as necessary and as directed by us or your Sponsor, respectively.   We may also disclose your information to our affiliate, Limeade, Inc. (“Limeade”), for the purpose of having Limeade employees provide services to us in order to better serve you.
We may also give your personal information to other third parties under special circumstances such as:
A court order, search warrant, subpoena, or other legal purpose that we deem to be valid;
To protect our rights, your rights, or the rights of others; and
A corporate transaction that results in a transfer of the assets or line of business that holds your information.
Should any of these events occur, WebMD will attempt to notify you through the email address you provided us, unless doing so would violate a law or court order.
How We Safeguard Your Information
We use reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access and changes.

General Data Protection Regulation
The EU General Data Protection Regulation and UK General Data Protection Regulation (together the "GDPR") require certain information to be provided to data subjects located in the EEA and the UK, and grant them certain rights regarding their personal data. This section applies solely to the processing activities that are governed by the GDPR.

This Privacy Policy describes how WebMD processes your personal data.

WebMD may also transfer your personal data to third-party service providers to help us provide the WebMD Services to you. Personal data may be stored and processed in any country where WebMD has engaged service providers. If you are located in the EEA in the UK, please note that your personal data may be transferred to the United States or another country that may not be considered to have the same level of data protection as the countries in the EEA or the UK.

To exercise these rights, or if you have any questions or comments regarding your personal data, please contact us at privacy@webmd.com.

Editorial Integrity
Our mission is to bring you the most objective, trustworthy, and accurate health information. Our daily goal is to ensure that WebMD is your practical and relevant content source for health and medicine.
We are committed to providing information on a wide variety of health topics, and rather than filtering certain types of information that may or may not be applicable to any one individual's personal health, we rely on you, our reader, to choose the information that is most appropriate for you.   However, the original editorial information we provide is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.  Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.  Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the WebMD Site!
The following sections detail our content policies and procedures.
Editorial Selection of Original Content Created by WebMD
WebMD creates original content with reference generally to the following criteria:
Relevance
-- Issues that could affect how you manage your own health and that of your family. Topics include coverage of breaking health news; drug and product launches, recalls, and alerts; health advisories; and expert commentary on managing diseases and conditions and staying healthy.
Clinical Significance
-- The latest medical findings published in peer-reviewed medical journals, such as The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Pediatrics, Diabetes Care, Circulation, and many others.
Trends
-- Seasonal interests, such as "Summer Safety", "Allergy Seasons", and "Cold and Flu"; public health awareness, such as "Breast Cancer Awareness Month" and "Healthy Heart Month"; and emerging health trends, such as the latest in nutrition, fitness, disease prevention, healthy living, alternative approaches, and much more.
Our Content Is Different
It's more reliable. In a medium often accused of providing outdated and inaccurate information, WebMD stands out as a credible, authoritative source of health information.
Our news and feature stories are based on our editors' selections of the most important and relevant health events occurring on a given day. Our news articles are more than a short summary of a study or an event. They often contain interviews with the medical researchers who authored them, plus interviews with objective experts who can put the research into context and tell the reader what it means in today's world.
Editorial Integrity
-- WebMD's journalistic responsibility is to make a clear distinction between news, features, reference, and other editorial information, so that individuals can readily distinguish independent editorial information from advertising.
Editorial Independence
-- In its reporting, WebMD maintains exemplary principles of fairness, accuracy, objectivity, and responsible, independent reporting.  WebMD maintains sole control of its editorial content.
Journalistic Excellence
-- WebMD upholds traditional journalistic principles of excellence in reporting original news for the Internet and in reviewing and corroborating information from other sources. Our content continues to win awards and recognitions in journalistic excellence and you can see our most current list of awards by checking our Awards page.
Health Equity
-- WebMD is dedicated to creating content by and for all people and to helping close health equity gaps.
Editorial Policy for WebMD Editorial Staff
WebMD is the leading provider of health information services, serving consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals. Editorial content created by WebMD is free from influence by advertisers and other sources.
Anyone who serves on the WebMD Editorial staff must fully disclose any potential conflict of interest with any sponsor or vendor.
The WebMD Editorial staff is charged with the responsibility of providing objective, accurate, and balanced accounts of events and issues. WebMD reporters must diligently seek out subjects of stories or qualified experts to provide commentary. They also seek objective commentary or comment from a qualified spokesperson to provide balance.
WebMD journalists strive to provide thorough and honest coverage and share a dedication to the highest professional standards.
Original Content Process
The content that we produce and the news that we feature is determined by our staff of physicians and medical journalists. It contains the latest information from reliable sources including the most important peer-reviewed medical journals, announcements from federal health agencies, and analyses on the latest health trends. Our experienced health reporters talk daily with prominent medical leaders, providing in-depth analyses, updates, and profiles that give our health news and content a perspective found nowhere else. Every original article is reviewed by our staff of full-time, board-certified physician editors.
Third parties may provide funding to WebMD for the creation by WebMD of original editorial content for the WebMD Network. In such cases, the third party may work with WebMD to  identify a mutually agreed upon general topic, but the content will be produced in accordance with our Original Content Process and the third party will have no control over the content. At their request, these third parties may receive the attribution "Supported by [third party's name]" on our editorial content during the period that they fund a program. This attribution is not intended to reflect any change in the editorial nature of the content.
Each completed story to be published is reviewed by a physician editor for accuracy, appropriateness of medical language, and proper characterization of the findings. The story is next reviewed by an Editorial editor who edits it for style, flow, punctuation, and readability. Finally, the story moves from editing to publishing to the site.
Licensed and Third Party Content
When WebMD licenses health and wellness content from third-parties for publication on our site, the WebMD senior Editorial editors and physician editors review the third-party's editorial policies and procedures for consistency with the WebMD Editorial Policies.

Note to Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK
General Data Protection Regulation
The EU General Data Protection Regulation and UK General Data Protection Regulation (together the "GDPR") require certain information to be provided to data subjects located in the EEA and the UK, and grant them certain rights regarding their personal data. This section applies solely to the processing activities that are governed by the GDPR.
Data Controller and EEA Representative
When you access the WebMD Services, your Sponsor and WebMD are separate controllers of certain processing activities related to your personal data. WebMD has appointed Dentons Europe Consulting B.V. as its representative in the EEA. WebMD's Data Protection Officer can be contacted at privacy@webmd.com. This Privacy Policy describes how WebMD processes your personal data.
Legal Bases for Processing
We may process your personal data in order to perform a contract with you (e.g., to deliver the WebMD Services you have requested) or in order to take certain steps prior to entering into such contract. For example, we may process your personal data in the following instances:
In order to provide you with the WebMD Services, you will need to create an account with WebMD and we will need to verify you as the account owner.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may need to contact you in order to provide you with information about your account or other health management and wellbeing program services.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may provide personalized services and more relevant content to you, based on the information you provide to us and on the information that we collect as part of your use of the WebMD Services.
As part of the WebMD Services, we may provide you with information for general service and transactional purposes, such as answering your questions, administering your account, responding to your complaints, and processing your data subject rights requests.
We may offer health management and wellbeing programs as part of the WebMD Services, and in order for you to participate in these programs, we may receive certain types of data from third-party service providers engaged by us or your Sponsor. These service providers may include entities that offer biometric screenings or flu shot services.
We may also process your personal data based on our legitimate interests or on the legitimate interests of third parties, such as your Sponsor, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal data in order to:
Keep the WebMD Services safe and secure;
Comply with laws and regulations that apply to us;
Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions; and
Understand and improve the WebMD Services.
Finally, we may process your personal data when you have given us your explicit consent to such processing, particularly:
The sensitive/special category personal data you provide to us; and
When you consent to receiving newsletters, marketing materials, and other promotional offers from us.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to decline consent or withdraw your consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object.
Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the EEA and the UK
WebMD, the controller of your personal data, is located in the United States. Accordingly, your personal data is processed by WebMD in the United States.
WebMD may also transfer your personal data to third-party service providers to help us provide the WebMD Services to you. Personal data may be stored and processed in any country where WebMD has engaged service providers. If you are located in the EEA in the UK, please note that your personal data may be transferred to the United States or another country that may not be considered to have the same level of data protection as the countries in the EEA or the UK. However, please note that we have implemented appropriate safeguards by entering into standard contractual clauses with any service provider located outside the EEA and the UK.
Additionally, we participate in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework. To learn more, click
here.
Retention of Personal Data
WebMD will retain your personal data up to ninety (90) days after your account deactivation. Thereafter, the data will be archived in order to comply with applicable law or regulation that you, WebMD, or your Sponsor may be subject to, such as HIPAA, or the data will be fully anonymized.
Your Rights to Your Personal Data
Under the GDPR, and in certain circumstances, you may ask to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or port your personal data, as well as, object to the use of your personal data. To exercise these rights, or if you have any questions or comments regarding your personal data, please contact us at privacy@webmd.com.
When we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent, at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of such processing before your withdrawal. To withdraw your consent, please submit a written request to privacy@webmd.com.
For processing necessary to perform the contract, or based on our legitimate interests, we may be unable to accommodate any requests to cease such processing; or if we do accommodate such requests, you may lose access to the WebMD Services.
If you believe that we have not complied with our obligations under this Privacy Policy or the GDPR, you have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.
Do You Need to Provide Personal Data?
We need to process your personal data in order to provide you with the WebMD Services. If you do not want to provide any personal data, you may not enjoy all or part of the WebMD Services.
Automated Decision-Making
WebMD does not make automated decisions that create legal effects or otherwise significantly affect you.
Our Safeguards and Security Measures
We have implemented technology and security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction, and accidental loss. For more information, please refer to the
How We Safeguard Your Information
section above.
By using the WebMD Services or providing personal information to us, you acknowledge that we may communicate with you electronically about any security, privacy, or administrative issues relating to your use of the WebMD Services. If You have any reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us immediately at privacy@webmd.com.
Your Health Plan's Notice of Privacy Practices
You should know that your health plan has a Notice of Privacy Practices, which includes policies for use and disclosure of your information, including information that you provide to WebMD.
This is managed by your health plan, not by WebMD, so we aren't able to let you know of changes or updates. If you would like to read a copy of your health plan's Notice of Privacy Practices, please ask your Sponsor or your plan for a copy.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may change parts of this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes take effect at the time they are posted unless otherwise noted. You will be required to opt-in to the new policy when they log back in after any material changes. We will update the date at the end of this Privacy Policy if we make any changes.

Information collected from our Services: The information collected from your usage of 
					the Services generally falls under the definition of “protected health information” under 
					HIPAA and is therefore excluded from the definition of “Personal Information” under the Applicable Data
					Privacy Laws.
Under the Applicable Data Privacy Laws, there is a subset of Personal Information 
					known as “Sensitive Personal Information.”  Although not all of the information included 
					in the definition of “Sensitive Personal Information” is collected by us (as mentioned 
					above, the protected health information that we collect is excluded from these definitions), 
					we believe that you should be aware of what is considered Sensitive Personal Information.  
					To that end, Sensitive Personal Information may include: (1) personal information that reveals 
					(a) a social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number, 
					(b) account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with 
					any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account, 
					(c) precise geolocation, (d) racial or ethnic origin, immigration status, religious or 
					philosophical beliefs, or union membership, (e) the contents of mail, email, and text messages 
					except where we are the intended recipient of the communication, (f) genetic data; (2) the 
					processing of biometric or genetic information for the purpose of uniquely identifying a 
					consumer; (3) personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s health or 
					diagnosis; (4) personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s sex life or
					sexual orientation; and (5) personal information collected from a known child.
To the extent that we collect and store certain categories of Sensitive Personal Information, 
					it is used to provide services to you and for short-term, transient use based on your interactions 
					with the Services.

Additional State-granted Privacy Rights
Applicable Data Privacy Laws provide consumers with specific rights regarding
					their Personal Information.  This section describes your consumer rights and 
					explains how to exercise those rights:
You may request, up to two (2) times each year, that we disclose to you,
					once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, the: (1)
					categories and specific pieces of Personal Information that we have
					collected about you; (2) categories of sources from which your Personal
					Information is collected; (3) business or commercial purpose for collecting
					your Personal Information; (4) categories of Personal Information that we
					disclosed for a business purpose; (5) categories of Personal Information
					that we sold about you; (6) categories of third-parties with whom we have
					shared your Personal Information; and (7) business or commercial purpose for

Subject to certain exceptions and up to two (2) times each year, you may

					from you. Once we receive and confirmed your verifiable consumer request for
					deletion, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) such
					Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal 
					Information about you, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information 
					and the purposes of processing your Personal Information. Once we receive and 
					verify your consumer request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to 
					correct (and direct our service providers to correct) your inaccurate Personal 
					Information from our records, unless it is impossible or involves a 
					disproportionate effort.
Right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information. 
					The CCPA defines “sale” and “share” broadly, and it may include our sharing 
					information that we have about you, such as a cookie ID or IP address, with 
					third party advertising partners who may use this information, on our behalf, 
					to help us deliver advertising, including advertising on third party websites.   
					You have the right to opt-out of the sale or share of your Personal Information 
					subject to certain exclusions. Once we receive your request, we will not sell 
					or share your Personal Information, unless an exclusion applies. We may request 
					that you authorize the sale or sharing of your Personal Information after 12
					months following your opt-out.

You will be asked to provide certain identifying information, such as your name,
					email, and residency. While processing your request, we may ask you to provide
					further verifying documentation. We will only use Personal Information provided
					in a request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the
					request. Only you or a person registered with the applicable state
					that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
					related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer
					request on behalf of your minor child. If you are making a request through an
					authorized agent acting on your behalf, such authorized agent must provide proof
					of written authorization to do so, and you must verify your identity directly
					with us, unless such authorized agent provides proof of a power of attorney
					pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the
					Applicable Data Privacy Laws. Accordingly, and unless permitted by the Applicable Data 
					Privacy Laws, we will not: deny you services; charge you different prices or rates 
					for services; provide you a different level of service; or suggest that you may 
					receive a different price or rate for services or a different level for services. 
					We may charge a different price or rate or provide a different level of service if 
					the difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your Personal Information.
