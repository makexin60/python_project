General
We may transfer your personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA which have not received an adequacy decision by the EU Commission (as further set out in Section 7.2(a) below). This means that the laws of such country are not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data. In such cases, we will put in place adequate safeguards (including security measures) to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected.
For information regarding whether we have transferred your personal data to a country outside of the EU/EEA, what countries we have transferred your personal data to as well as what security measures that have been implemented, please contact us by sending a written request to us via the contact information listed in section 14. You can find more information about which countries are deemed to have an “adequate level of protection” on the
European Commission’s website
, and you can read more about the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses
here
.
Safety measures when transferring data outside of the EU/EEA
Countries outside of the EU/EEA may have laws that allow public authorities to request access to personal data stored in the country for the purpose of combating crime or safeguarding national security. Regardless of whether we or any of our providers process your personal data, we will ensure that a high level of protection is guaranteed when transferring that data and that appropriate protection measures have been taken, in accordance with applicable data protection requirements (such as the GDPR). Such appropriate safeguards include, but are not limited to, ensuring:
if the European Commission has decided that the country outside of the EU/EEA to which your personal data are transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the GDPR. This means for example that the personal data is still protected from unauthorized disclosure, and that you may still exercise your rights with regard to your personal data; or
the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses have been entered into between us and the recipient of the personal data outside the EU/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. In these cases, we also assess whether there are laws in the recipient country that affects the protection of your personal data. Where necessary, we take technical and organizational measures so that your data remain protected during the transfer to the relevant country outside the EU/EEA.
Security
Security measures
We store and access personal data in various locations and cloud services. Servers that store information for us are primarily located in Sweden and Europe, although storage may occur in other locations as well. We use reasonable administrative, technical and organizational measures (a) to safeguard personal data against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, and (b) to ensure the integrity of your personal data. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of any user-IDs and passwords, membership numbers, or other identifiers or credentials you may have set up or were provided with in connection with your participation in or use of our products, services, or websites.
Transmissions
As you may be aware, there is no completely secure method of transmitting or storing data. There are risks related to all kinds of transmission (such as loss, fault, monitoring and misuse of transferred data) due to the different ways to transmit are different from each other (e.g. postal mail, text messages, faxes, and transfers via the Internet or wireless networks). If you have reason to believe that any account with us is no longer secure, you must immediately contact us.
We try to strike a balance between the security of your data and your convenience. As a result, we may sometimes use a method of communication that is less secure than a less convenient alternative. For example, we may send you an e-mail or a text message in unencrypted form (i.e. instantly readable) because many of our customers are unable to access encrypted (i.e. coded) e-mail or messages. This means that our message, if misrouted or intercepted, could be read more easily than encrypted messages. Such messages may contain personal data. Please do not include confidential information, such as your credit card number or account passwords, in any e-mail or text you send to us or on any posting you make to a public area of a third-party social network page, especially since any such posting immediately becomes public. For a more secure way to communicate with us over the Internet, please see our contact information in our app.
Access
We restrict access to our employees and providers who need to use it in order to process it on our behalf, and who are contractually by law required to keep your personal data secure and confidential. We aim to choose the option for data processing that best safeguards the integrity of your personal data toward any third party.

Automated decision-making including profiling
Sometimes we use automated decision-making. It can e.g. be an automated rejection of a reservation. Usage of automated decision-making could for instance mean that you do not have the possibility to reserve certain vehicles based on your age or any vehicle based on your credit rating which you have provided or we which have obtained electronically without personal contact. This information is relevant since we made a risk assessment implying that it is not commercially desirable to rent out certain categories of vehicles to people under a certain age or with a low credit rating.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on any form of automated decision-making, including profiling, if the decision may have legal consequences for you or in a significant way affects you in any other way. However, we have the right to use automated decision-making if it is necessary for entering into or performance of an agreement between you and us or if you have given consent to the processing.
We make this kind of automated decisions in the following cases:
When taking decisions regarding if you fulfil our drivers’ licence requirements (see section 2.2).
When checking our age requirements (see section 2.1).
In relation to credit assessments, including credit checks and checks against Biluthyrarna Sverige’s information list (see sections 2.1 and 2.4).
When checking the validity of your credit card (see section 2.4).
When segmenting and sorting our users into different customer segments (see section 2.9 and 2.20).
If you are not approved under the automated decisions described above, you will not have access to our services. We have several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. If you have any concern about the outcome, you can contact us via the contact information provided in section 14 to express your opinion and oppose the decision.

This means that the laws of such country are not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data. In such cases, we will put in place adequate safeguards (including security measures) to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected.
For information regarding whether we have transferred your personal data to a country outside of the EU/EEA, what countries we have transferred your personal data to as well as what security measures that have been implemented, please contact us by sending a written request to us via the contact information listed in section 14. You can find more information about which countries are deemed to have an “adequate level of protection” on the
European Commission’s website
, and you can read more about the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses
here
.
Safety measures when transferring data outside of the EU/EEA
Countries outside of the EU/EEA may have laws that allow public authorities to request access to personal data stored in the country for the purpose of combating crime or safeguarding national security. Regardless of whether we or any of our providers process your personal data, we will ensure that a high level of protection is guaranteed when transferring that data and that appropriate protection measures have been taken, in accordance with applicable data protection requirements (such as the GDPR). Such appropriate safeguards include, but are not limited to, ensuring:
if the European Commission has decided that the country outside of the EU/EEA to which your personal data are transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the GDPR. This means for example that the personal data is still protected from unauthorized disclosure, and that you may still exercise your rights with regard to your personal data; or
the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses have been entered into between us and the recipient of the personal data outside the EU/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. In these cases, we also assess whether there are laws in the recipient country that affects the protection of your personal data. Where necessary, we take technical and organizational measures so that your data remain protected during the transfer to the relevant country outside the EU/EEA.
Security
Security measures
We store and access personal data in various locations and cloud services. Servers that store information for us are primarily located in Sweden and Europe, although storage may occur in other locations as well. We use reasonable administrative, technical and organizational measures (a) to safeguard personal data against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, and (b) to ensure the integrity of your personal data. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of any user-IDs and passwords, membership numbers, or other identifiers or credentials you may have set up or were provided with in connection with your participation in or use of our products, services, or websites.
Transmissions
As you may be aware, there is no completely secure method of transmitting or storing data. There are risks related to all kinds of transmission (such as loss, fault, monitoring and misuse of transferred data) due to the different ways to transmit are different from each other (e.g. postal mail, text messages, faxes, and transfers via the Internet or wireless networks). If you have reason to believe that any account with us is no longer secure, you must immediately contact us.
We try to strike a balance between the security of your data and your convenience. As a result, we may sometimes use a method of communication that is less secure than a less convenient alternative. For example, we may send you an e-mail or a text message in unencrypted form (i.e. instantly readable) because many of our customers are unable to access encrypted (i.e. coded) e-mail or messages. This means that our message, if misrouted or intercepted, could be read more easily than encrypted messages. Such messages may contain personal data. Please do not include confidential information, such as your credit card number or account passwords, in any e-mail or text you send to us or on any posting you make to a public area of a third-party social network page, especially since any such posting immediately becomes public. For a more secure way to communicate with us over the Internet, please see our contact information in our app.
Access
We restrict access to our employees and providers who need to use it in order to process it on our behalf, and who are contractually by law required to keep your personal data secure and confidential. We aim to choose the option for data processing that best safeguards the integrity of your personal data toward any third party.

Third party services and apps
When using our vehicles, you may access applications and other services linked with the vehicle but provided by a third party, which may, for example, require transmission of location data and other vehicle-recorded data to this third party. Neither we nor any of our group companies are responsible for the collection or use of personal data in applications or services provided by a third party, and recommends that you carefully review applicable terms for (and any privacy policy related to) such applications or services before you use them.

Automated decision-making including profiling
Sometimes we use automated decision-making. It can e.g. be an automated rejection of a reservation. Usage of automated decision-making could for instance mean that you do not have the possibility to reserve certain vehicles based on your age or any vehicle based on your credit rating which you have provided or we which have obtained electronically without personal contact. This information is relevant since we made a risk assessment implying that it is not commercially desirable to rent out certain categories of vehicles to people under a certain age or with a low credit rating.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on any form of automated decision-making, including profiling, if the decision may have legal consequences for you or in a significant way affects you in any other way. However, we have the right to use automated decision-making if it is necessary for entering into or performance of an agreement between you and us or if you have given consent to the processing.
We make this kind of automated decisions in the following cases:
When taking decisions regarding if you fulfil our drivers’ licence requirements (see section 2.2).
When checking our age requirements (see section 2.1).
In relation to credit assessments, including credit checks and checks against Biluthyrarna Sverige’s information list (see sections 2.1 and 2.4).
When checking the validity of your credit card (see section 2.4).
When segmenting and sorting our users into different customer segments (see section 2.9 and 2.20).
If you are not approved under the automated decisions described above, you will not have access to our services. We have several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. If you have any concern about the outcome, you can contact us via the contact information provided in section 14 to express your opinion and oppose the decision.

Will we transfer your personal data outside of the EU/EEA?
General
We may transfer your personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA which have not received an adequacy decision by the EU Commission (as further set out in Section 7.2(a) below). This means that the laws of such country are not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data. In such cases, we will put in place adequate safeguards (including security measures) to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected.
For information regarding whether we have transferred your personal data to a country outside of the EU/EEA, what countries we have transferred your personal data to as well as what security measures that have been implemented, please contact us by sending a written request to us via the contact information listed in section 14. You can find more information about which countries are deemed to have an “adequate level of protection” on the
European Commission’s website
, and you can read more about the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses
here
.
Safety measures when transferring data outside of the EU/EEA
Countries outside of the EU/EEA may have laws that allow public authorities to request access to personal data stored in the country for the purpose of combating crime or safeguarding national security. Regardless of whether we or any of our providers process your personal data, we will ensure that a high level of protection is guaranteed when transferring that data and that appropriate protection measures have been taken, in accordance with applicable data protection requirements (such as the GDPR). Such appropriate safeguards include, but are not limited to, ensuring:
if the European Commission has decided that the country outside of the EU/EEA to which your personal data are transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the GDPR. This means for example that the personal data is still protected from unauthorized disclosure, and that you may still exercise your rights with regard to your personal data; or
the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses have been entered into between us and the recipient of the personal data outside the EU/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. In these cases, we also assess whether there are laws in the recipient country that affects the protection of your personal data. Where necessary, we take technical and organizational measures so that your data remain protected during the transfer to the relevant country outside the EU/EEA.
Security
Security measures
We store and access personal data in various locations and cloud services. Servers that store information for us are primarily located in Sweden and Europe, although storage may occur in other locations as well. We use reasonable administrative, technical and organizational measures (a) to safeguard personal data against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, and (b) to ensure the integrity of your personal data. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of any user-IDs and passwords, membership numbers, or other identifiers or credentials you may have set up or were provided with in connection with your participation in or use of our products, services, or websites.
Transmissions
As you may be aware, there is no completely secure method of transmitting or storing data. There are risks related to all kinds of transmission (such as loss, fault, monitoring and misuse of transferred data) due to the different ways to transmit are different from each other (e.g. postal mail, text messages, faxes, and transfers via the Internet or wireless networks). If you have reason to believe that any account with us is no longer secure, you must immediately contact us.
We try to strike a balance between the security of your data and your convenience. As a result, we may sometimes use a method of communication that is less secure than a less convenient alternative. For example, we may send you an e-mail or a text message in unencrypted form (i.e. instantly readable) because many of our customers are unable to access encrypted (i.e. coded) e-mail or messages. This means that our message, if misrouted or intercepted, could be read more easily than encrypted messages. Such messages may contain personal data. Please do not include confidential information, such as your credit card number or account passwords, in any e-mail or text you send to us or on any posting you make to a public area of a third-party social network page, especially since any such posting immediately becomes public. For a more secure way to communicate with us over the Internet, please see our contact information in our app.
Access
We restrict access to our employees and providers who need to use it in order to process it on our behalf, and who are contractually by law required to keep your personal data secure and confidential. We aim to choose the option for data processing that best safeguards the integrity of your personal data toward any third party.
Personal Data Processed by Volvo Car Corporation as Controller
Most of the cars provided through the Service are Volvo cars. When using such a vehicle, our group company Volvo Car Corporation will process certain personal data generated by the vehicle as controller. Information regarding this processing is found in
Volvo Car Corporation’s privacy notice for car generated data
.
Third party services and apps
When using our vehicles, you may access applications and other services linked with the vehicle but provided by a third party, which may, for example, require transmission of location data and other vehicle-recorded data to this third party. Neither we nor any of our group companies are responsible for the collection or use of personal data in applications or services provided by a third party, and recommends that you carefully review applicable terms for (and any privacy policy related to) such applications or services before you use them. If you have questions concerning a certain third party use of your personal data, please contact the third party directly. We also recommend looking for privacy choices and controls in third party applications after downloading.
Cookies
In general, you can visit our websites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. However, to be able to provide you with certain services or offerings, we often need to record certain items of personal data, such as your name and e-mail address. We may also collect (by means of cookies) anonymous information on how you have used our websites prior to such recording. This information will be helpful to us in order to improve our websites or marketing. All our websites open to our customers include information concerning our use of cookies. For certain countries there is also an online procedure for accepting or declining cookies. For more information regarding our use of cookies, please our cookie policy published at https://www.volvocars.com/se/v/legal/cookies.
Our webpages are not directed to individuals below 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from such individuals.

Automated decision-making including profiling
Sometimes we use automated decision-making. It can e.g. be an automated rejection of a reservation. Usage of automated decision-making could for instance mean that you do not have the possibility to reserve certain vehicles based on your age or any vehicle based on your credit rating which you have provided or we which have obtained electronically without personal contact. This information is relevant since we made a risk assessment implying that it is not commercially desirable to rent out certain categories of vehicles to people under a certain age or with a low credit rating.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on any form of automated decision-making, including profiling, if the decision may have legal consequences for you or in a significant way affects you in any other way. However, we have the right to use automated decision-making if it is necessary for entering into or performance of an agreement between you and us or if you have given consent to the processing.
We make this kind of automated decisions in the following cases:
When taking decisions regarding if you fulfil our drivers’ licence requirements (see section 2.2).
When checking our age requirements (see section 2.1).
In relation to credit assessments, including credit checks and checks against Biluthyrarna Sverige’s information list (see sections 2.1 and 2.4).
When checking the validity of your credit card (see section 2.4).
When segmenting and sorting our users into different customer segments (see section 2.9 and 2.20).
If you are not approved under the automated decisions described above, you will not have access to our services. We have several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. If you have any concern about the outcome, you can contact us via the contact information provided in section 14 to express your opinion and oppose the decision.
What rights do you have?
Below is a summary of the rights you have in relation to our processing of your personal data. The exercise of these rights is free of charge and you may exercise the rights by contacting us via the contact information provided in section 14.

Effective from:
2024-12-16
Published at:
2024-12-16
This privacy notice explains how Volvo Cars (as defined below) process data related to vehicles and connected services provided by Volvo Cars.
For an explanation of vehicle features and functions, please check the
owner’s manual
for the relevant model. Please note that if there are any differences between this notice and the owner’s manual related to the processing of personal data, this notice takes precedence.
Since the processing of data depends on the features and functions with which the vehicle is equipped, and on the services which you choose to activate, this document presents the widest extent of possible processing. If you have an older vehicle, or if a new model is not equipped with a certain feature or function, the data processing associated with that feature will not happen.
This privacy notice does not apply to:
Special vehicles (e.g. police cars)
Processing of personal data that does not leave the car (local processing)
Processing of personal data when you interact with one of our retailers (such as when you buy your car)
Your use of software, apps and services provided by third parties. (For further information, please see the individual service providers’ own terms and conditions as well as their privacy policies/notices)
The provision of the internet/connectivity service in your car, which is supplied by a mobile network operator independently from Volvo Cars.

Updates to this notice
1. Who we are
The entity responsible for the processing of personal data referred to below is Volvo Car Corporation, having its registered office at Assar Gabrielssons Väg, SE-405 31 Gothenburg, Sweden, company registration number 556074-3089, hereinafter referred to as “Volvo Cars”, “we”, or “us”. If other entities are processing personal data together with us, so called joint controllers, this will be specified.
2. What personal data we use and why
2.1 Data used for infotainment purposes
2.1.1 Driving Journal
The Driving Journal automatically logs all your trips. This may be useful if, for example, you want to manage your mileage expenses. The Driving Journal must be activated by you, otherwise the data is not collected.
If you enable the Driving Journal, we will collect your identifiers such as first and last name, phone number, E-mail address, your vehicle identification number (VIN), and the vehicle’s location as well as other trip related information such as your routes, time, distance, fuel and/or electric consumption and mileage. Depending on your vehicle model only start and finish position is collected or the full route.
We process this data based on your consent.
As a rule, the Driving Journal’s data is stored for up to 400 days depending on car model. You can disable the Driving Journal at any time, and by doing so the data will stop being collected. This does not trigger the deletion of previously collected information.
2.1.2 Over the air software updates (OTA)
Over the air software updates enable your vehicle to update and maintain the latest software without visiting a workshop. Using the latest software ensures you can fully utilize our updated services. By using the latest software, you are also improving your protection against cybersecurity incidents.
To maintain vehicle software and provide necessary software updates, we process the following data:
Vehicle identification number (VIN)
Vehicle software version
Diagnostic trouble codes
Vehicle manufacturing date
Vehicle specification
Installation status and reports
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is your consent.
We will retain records of the software updates made for the entire vehicle lifetime.
You can agree or disagree to automatic software updates at any time in the privacy settings. If you agree, software updates are downloaded automatically, and you will be notified when the update is ready to install. If you disagree, you will be notified when a new update is available and can be downloaded. If you don’t want to use over the air software updates, you can have updates installed in a workshop with the required connection to our systems.
2.1.3 Connected Safety
Our vehicles are equipped with Connected Safety, a service offered by us, which informs you about current traffic hazards while you drive the vehicle. This information is based on information sent from other vehicles or from public sources where applicable. This information is used to alert you on changing road conditions or potential road hazard early on by displaying appropriate warnings, allowing you to adapt your driving style accordingly. If your own vehicle detects a potential road hazard, such as reduced friction between your tires and the road or if the hazard warning lights are activated, this information is sent to Volvo Cars. The information is aggregated and anonymized before sent to vehicles approaching your own vehicle’s position.
The data that we collect and process to support Connected Safety is:
Vehicle identification number (VIN)
Event such as Slippery road alert activation, Hazard light activation etc.
Time stamp of each alert
Location
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is performance of the contract. You can switch the service on and off at any time.
In addition, the abovementioned data is processed anonymously and transmitted to traffic agencies and companies, in order to avoid and reduce dangers posed by road traffic, but also to improve road safety, to reduce maintenance costs and contribute to a sustainable traffic environment. Volvo Cars and Polestar Performance AB (a Swedish company headquartered in Gothenburg, Assar Gabrielssons Väg 9, SE-405 31, Sweden, hereinafter referred to as “Polestar”) are joint controllers for these purposes. As so-called joint controllers under GDPR, Volvo Cars and Polestar are jointly responsible for this processing. Volvo Cars and Polestar have agreed that Volvo Cars is responsible for providing information to its customers, and that the respective rights afforded by GDPR will be exercised by Volvo customers in relation to Volvo Cars.
We will retain the information for 1 week.
2.1.4 Digital Key
Digital key can fully replace the conventional car key, and allows you to conveniently lock, unlock, or start your vehicle with your smartphone or smart watch. In addition, it is also possible to share your key with additional users through various digital channels.
Digital key only requires network connection during the initial one-time set-up, for sharing of keys, or revoking keys. Once set-up, the key will work via Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), and Ultra-Wideband Technology (UWB). During set-up, your key will be added to your wallet app in your smart device. From your wallet app you can share your key through messaging apps, mail, or via Airdrop
®
. You can also easily revoke keys you have shared, either through the wallet app, or in the vehicle infotainment system.
The following data is processed when using digital key:
Vehicle identification number (VIN)
Vehicle details
Vehicle status
Volvo ID
Key ID
Friendly name
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is performance of the contract.
We will retain your data as long as you have a valid contract.
2.1.5 Real-time Traffic Information (RTTI)
The Real Time Traffic Information service receives information about road traffic information from a 3rd party service provider.
We process the following data from the car:
Vehicle position and speed – these are shared with the 3rd party service provider to calculate congestion and to inform you and other drivers where risks for congestion exist; these data points are anonymous for the 3rd party service provider.
Vehicle Identity Number (VIN) – this is used by Volvo Cars to verify that your vehicle has a subscription for this service.
Car models equipped with sensors that can identify traffic signs in real time as you drive do this through local processing (in the car) only.
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is performance of the contract. You can switch the service on and off at any time.
The data will be stored by Volvo Cars as long as the subscription is active. Once the subscription is inactive, VIN, speed and position are stored for maximum of 90 days, unless a longer time is required under local applicable law.
2.1.6 Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA)
Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA) is a mandatory function in some jurisdictions that uses road sign data to assist cars in keeping the speed limit. In order to know the speed limit on the current road ISA uses the car’s navigation system to fetch road sign data. The navigation system in turn needs the car's position to provide the correct data.
In addition, Volvo Cars is legally required to report aggregated data on your usage of the vehicle, like:
how much time or how long distances you have travelled with the advanced vehicle systems activated or deactivated
how much time or how long distanced you have travelled by observing or overriding the recognized speed limits
the time elapsed between the activation and deactivation of the advanced vehicle systems
To support ISA and the reporting, the following data is processed:
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
Vehicle speed
Vehicle details (model, production year)
Information generated by the vehicle, its sensors and systems (warnings, faults, diagnostics, status and behaviour of the advanced vehicle systems)
Information related to how the vehicle is used and operated (settings, use of the advanced vehicle systems)
Location
The legal basis for us to process the data mentioned above is to fulfil our legal obligations.
We retain the information until it has been aggregated and sent to relevant authorities.
2.1.7 Speech Messaging
Speech Messaging is part of a larger voice command system with which you can control features of your infotainment system, and lets you create and send SMS messages by giving verbal instructions. To initiate a dialogue using voice commands, you first need to activate this function. Voice control will remain activated until you deliberately stop it or until you have not responded to three prompts from the system.
The following data is processed when using Speech Messaging:

Services offered as part of the Call Centre Services are described below:
Roadside Assistance (RSA)
RSA involves supporting you when you experience a technical fault with your vehicle, such as a flat tire or a fault with the engine/motor. In some cases, the agent at the call centre is able to provide guidance on the call to you on how to remedy the issue. In other cases, the repair can be made at the roadside (called a ‘spot repair’) or, where that is not possible, your vehicle will need towing to a workshop to be fixed. The agent will assess what response is appropriate during the call. Where roadside recovery is needed (spot repair or a tow), assistance vehicles can be provided by a third party, such as a roadside vehicle towing and repair company, who then will process the related data.
Stolen Vehicle Tracking (SVT)
SVT is a way to locate your vehicle if stolen. A vehicle may be reported stolen by:
the vehicle itself. This happens when the vehicle detects a trigger of the vehicle alarm, which causes a notification, known as a ‘theft notification’, to be sent to any driver with the Volvo Cars App connected to the vehicle, as well as to the call centre.
the owner of the vehicle, that makes a call to the call centre.
local law enforcement (police). Again, a call is made directly to the call centre.
For the SVT process to be initiated an official police report must be filed and the report case number needs to be submitted to the call centre.
Remote Vehicle Immobilisation/Mobilisation (RVI/RVM)
RVI/RVM can be used to enable or disable the immobiliser in the vehicle. If the immobiliser is enabled, the vehicle will not be able to be started until the immobiliser is disabled. The vehicle can then be remotely mobilised. This service is initiated by the call centre agent.
In order to provide you with the services described above, we will automatically collect the following data when contacting the call centre through the “on call”/assist button in the vehicle or through the Volvo Car App:

Where reasonably practical or as required by applicable law, we will, in connection to collecting or registering your Personal data, provide you with (i) specific information as to the purposes of the Processing of your Personal Data, (ii) the identity of the Controller, (iii) the identities of any third parties to whom the data may be disclosed and (iv) other information that may be necessary to ensure that you are able to safeguard your rights.

Consent
Where reasonably practical or as required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent prior to collecting or using your personal data. The request for your consent will be clear and specific and will provide you with a reasonable basis with which to make your decision. We will never take your consent for granted. Instead, we will make sure that you can consent in a clear and transparent manner. Your consent is voluntary and may always be revoked: for example, by terminating a particular service or contacting Volvo Cars at the address indicated in the "
Information and access
" section below. If you do not give your consent, it may not be possible to use services or parts of services.

When collecting or using vehicle-recorded data for these purposes, and for similar legitimate interests pursued by Volvo Cars, we will generally not seek your consent unless this is deemed necessary in the individual case or required by applicable law.
Third party applications
You may access applications and other services linked with the vehicle but provided by a third party, which may, for example, require transmission of location data and other Vehicle-recorded data to this third party. Volvo Cars is not responsible for the collection or use of Personal Data in applications or services provided by a third party and recommends that you carefully review applicable terms for (and any integrity policy related to) such applications or services before you use them. If you have questions concerning a certain third party's use of your personal data, please contact the third party directly.
International transfers
Volvo Cars may transfer your Personal Data to recipients in countries outside of the European Economic Area which may have differing data protection laws. This includes countries which the EU Commission does not consider to have an adequate level of protection for Personal Data. If this occurs, Volvo Cars will ensure there are legal grounds for the transfer, in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. You will also be informed about the legal grounds, what safeguards were implemented, and where you can obtain a copy of information on these safeguards.
Data use
For most Processing acts, you are able to terminate our use of your Personal Data by updating your preferences, terminating a particular service, revoking your consent to the processing by contacting Volvo Cars at the address indicated in the "
Information and Access
" section below, or as otherwise instructed by us. However, and unless otherwise provided in applicable law, you may generally not opt out of the processing of your personal data:
In relation to certain acts of collection and further processing of your vehicle-recorded data relating to safety, quality, and product improvement;
When we perform such processing in order to send you important notices, such as changes to our terms and conditions and policies or in case of product recalls; and
When we perform it in order to comply with our legal obligations.

We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or the purposes of which you have otherwise been informed. This means that when you have consented to our processing of your personal data, we will maintain the data for as long as the customer relationship lasts (and where applicable, until the expiration of the warranty period) or until you withdraw your consent. If you decide to end your customer relationship, we will retain the data for a period of five (5) years after which your data will be deleted. If we have not received your consent for Processing, the data will only be retained to the extent we are permitted to do so by law.
