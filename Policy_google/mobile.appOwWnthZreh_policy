Cookies and other technologies
What are cookies?
Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer’s hard drive. These are usually small text files. They help us personalize content for you on our pages and provide programs like e-coupons. You can set your browser to accept or reject cookies. Instructions for resetting the browser are in the Help section of most browsers.
How we use cookies.
Like many other websites and online services, we collect traffic and usage patterns. We use cookies, Web server logs and similar technologies to do this.
We use this information for various purposes:
To ensure that the Online Services function properly
To help with navigation (or how you find your way around the site)
To personalize your experience
To understand use of the Online Services
To diagnose problems
To measure the success of our marketing campaigns and targeted ads
To otherwise administer the Online Services
We also use cookies to collect and receive certain information about a website user, such as the type of web browser used, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, device platform, device version, and/or other device characteristics including your choice of settings such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Global Positioning System ("GPS"), CPU ID and type, build, model, manufacturer, operating system version, screen size, screen resolution, mobile network status, device locale, and carrier ID. We review our web server logs and our customers’ use of our site. This helps us to gather statistics on how many people are using our site and why.
Internet providers assign your device an IP address number. We may identify and log your IP address automatically in our Web server log files when you use our Online Services. We may also collect the time of your visit and the pages you look at. We use IP addresses to do things like gauge usage levels of the Online Services, help find server problems, and administer the Commercial Services.
Our Online Services use tracking technologies to collect and record your activities and movements across our websites throughout your browsing session, including page hits, mouse movements, scrolling, typing, out-of-the-box errors and events, and API calls (“Session Data”).

Interest based advertising
Like many companies, CVS participates in interest-based advertising. We may use or partner with third-party companies, including social media and third-party advertising companies tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online. Doing so helps us to measure services and display targeted ads when you access and use the Online Services.
These are ads about goods and services we feel may interest you based on your access to and your use of our Commercial Services and other online services. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These third parties may also use pixel tags, web beacons and other storage technologies to collect or receive information about your online activities over time and across our website and elsewhere on the Internet.
We may also use analytics providers that use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other similar technologies. They may collect or receive data about your use of our Commercial Services and other websites or online services. These analytics services (like Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics) provide services that analyze information regarding visits to our Online Services.

5.  Third-party service and features
The services may contain links to, or make available, third-party websites, services, features or other resources not run by us or on our behalf (the “Third-Party Services.”) We make these Third-Party Services available as a convenience to you and are not affiliated with, endorsing or sponsoring the Third-Party Services.
Any information you give to such third parties is not subject to the terms of this Workforce Privacy Policy.
We are not responsible for the privacy or security of the information you give to Third-Party Services or how they handle your information.

6.  Security
We use reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security. You should take steps to ensure your personal information is protected like using passwords that would be difficult to guess, not using the same password for multiple accounts and periodically changing your password.
7.  Cookies and other technologies
What are cookies?
Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer’s hard drive. These are usually small text files. You can set your browser to accept or reject cookies. Instructions for resetting the browser are in the “help” section of most browsers.
How we use cookies.
Like many other websites and online services, we collect traffic and usage patterns. We use cookies, web server logs and similar technologies to do this.
We use this information for various purposes:
To ensure that the services function properly
To help with navigation (or how you find your way around the site)
To understand use of the services
To diagnose problems
To measure the success of our talent campaigns
To otherwise administer the services
We also use cookies to collect and receive certain information about a website user, such as the type of web browser used, internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, device platform, device version and/or other device characteristics including your choice of settings such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Global Positioning System ("GPS"), CPU ID and type, build, model, manufacturer, operating system version, screen size, screen resolution, mobile network status, device locale and carrier ID.

Internet providers assign your device an IP address number. We may identify and log your IP address automatically in our web server log files when you use our services. We may also collect the time of your visit and the pages you look at. We use IP addresses to do things like gauge usage levels of the services, help find server problems, and administer services.
Our services use tracking technologies to collect and record your activities and movements across our websites throughout your browsing session, including page hits, mouse movements, scrolling, typing, out-of-the-box errors and events and API calls (“Session Data”).  We use this information to (1) remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it, (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the services, (3) perform analytics, (4) measure the usability of the services and the effectiveness of our communications; and (5) improve our products, services and your experience.  Such tracking may also include recorded sessions, which we may play back for these purposes.  We may share session data with our vendors (which may change over time) for these purposes.
