Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
​
We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site, App or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our service providers may do so on our behalf).
Cookies
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, App and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site, App and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.
Session Cookies.
Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site, App and Services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site, App and Services.
Persistent Cookies.
Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.
Disabling Cookies
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site and Services who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.
​
Clear GIFs, pixel tags, Local Storage Objects (LSO) and other technologies
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web and app pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site, App and Services to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors and App users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site and App usage. We and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded. In addition, we use local storage solutions to store web content such as log-information, in order to make your log-in process more efficient. We also use programs that leverage IndexedDB to permit you to use our Services offline on your mobile device.
Analytics
We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site and App. We use these tools to help us improve our Site’s and App’s performance and user experiences. The entities operating these tools may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at

Cross-Device Use
We and our service providers, including Google, may use the information that we collect about you (whether directly from our Site, App, through your device(s), or from another entity) to help us and our service providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer). We, and our service providers also may use the cross-device use and other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your devices and to send you emails. To opt-out of cross-device advertising, you may follow the instructions set forth in the Ad Networks section below. Please note: if you opt-out of these targeted advertising cookies, your opt-out will be specific to the web browser, app, or device from which you accessed the opt-out. If you use multiple devices or web browsers, you will need to opt-out each browser or device that you use.
​
Do-Not-Track
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the “Ad Networks” section below.
​
Ad Networks
​
We use other companies, such as ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services (“Advertisers”) to serve advertisements on our Site, App, and on other companies’ websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these Advertisers to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Advertisers may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to collect, receive and process information in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These cookies and other technologies are governed by Advertisers’ specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these Advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.
Links
​
Our Site, App and Services may contain links to other companies’ websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such websites.

Security of My Personal Information
​
We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security.
