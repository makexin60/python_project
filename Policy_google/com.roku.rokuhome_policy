Roku Privacy Policy
Roku respects and values the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy describes the information that Roku, Inc. and our affiliated companies other than TOH Intermediate Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (
“Roku,” “we,” or “us”
) collect about consumers (
“you”
and
“your household”
) and how we use and disclose that information.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Roku through the
“Roku Services”
, which includes:  Roku's websites (
“Roku Sites”
), Roku’s products and certain other products utilizing Roku’s streaming platform or operating systems (including Roku players, Roku TV models, Roku Smart Home devices, speakers and other audio-enabled products) (collectively,
“Roku Devices”
), Roku’s mobile apps (including the Roku Mobile App and Roku Smart Home App), Roku branded apps like the Roku Media Player and The Roku Channel (
“Roku’s Channels”
), Roku’s advertising services, Roku emails and newsletters, and Roku’s accounts on third-party social networking sites.
Using our products and services, you can access apps provided by other companies (
“Third-Party Channels”
), including hybrid broadcast broadband (
“hbbtv”
) channels that may be available in your region. When you install, access or stream one of these apps, you are also interacting with that app directly, and the app provider and its analytics and advertising partners may collect information from your Roku Device, including your device identifier and how you use their services. In addition, Roku’s Channels may also be available on platforms operated by other companies, including smart TVs, set top boxes, streaming devices, gaming devices, mobile devices or other internet connected devices. This Privacy Policy does not cover the actions and privacy practices of these app providers, platform operators or their partners. For more information about how these companies use your data, please see their privacy policies.
Part I. Information Collection
Information is collected from or about you from various sources, as described below.
A. Information You Provide
1. Registration Information
When you sign up for a Roku account, we ask for information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, birth date, tax ID (for users in certain countries), gender and other demographic information. We also may collect similar contact information if you register to use or receive other products or services offered through Roku, such as when you register to receive copies of blog posts.
When you subscribe to a streaming service from another provider through the Roku Services (e.g., when you subscribe to a streaming service on Roku Sites or within The Roku Channel, or to a Third-Party Channel on a Roku Device), your Roku account registration information may need to be collected by the provider to create an account with that service.  For more information about how these providers will use your data, please see their respective privacy policies.
2. Purchase, Payment and Shipping Information
When you add a credit card or payment method to your account or place an order with us, we will also collect your payment information and billing address, and if you make a product purchase, other information that may be needed to complete your purchase, such as your shipping address, tax ID or other verification information.
We connect you with merchants who partner with us to offer goods and services for sale on the Roku Services, through features such as shoppable ads. If you interact with a shoppable ad or if you choose to make a purchase on the Roku Services from these participating merchants, they and their partners will also collect information about you or information you provide, including your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, phone number, and payment information, to process the transaction, fulfill and ship your order, and for other purposes.  You should review the privacy policies of the companies with whom you choose to transact with to understand how your data will be used by them. Roku will also collect your purchase information.
3. Other Contact Information
If you use product features with text messaging or email, Roku will also collect the phone number, email address, and any other contact information you provide to communicate with you in accordance with your account preferences and device or service settings. You may modify your Roku communication preferences and settings at any time by updating this information in your Roku account, in the relevant Roku mobile app, or certain device settings. Please consult the relevant online support documentation
here
for more information.
4. Communications
If you contact us directly, we will receive additional information you provide, such as your name, email address and phone number, and the contents of any message or attachments that you send to us. You may also provide us with information if you subscribe to marketing communications from us or to obtain content such as product information, whitepapers and reports. If you message other users on the Roku Services like Roku Community, we will receive the contents of those messages.
5. Information You Provide About Others
We also collect the personal information of other people. For example, if you invite or refer our products or services to families and friends by providing their names or email addresses, or if you provide the postal addresses and other contact information of recipients for gift purchases. Personal information about other people may be collected and used when you use Roku Smart Home devices and services. For instance, your Smart Home Devices may capture videos, images or voice content of other individuals.
We rely on you to obtain any required permissions in advance to allow us to collect their personal information.
6. Uploaded Files
Roku collects and may review (for example, for content moderation purposes) any files, including photos, videos or audio files, that you choose to upload or make accessible to the Roku Services.
7. Comments, Reviews and Feedback
You can provide comments, reviews and feedback on Roku Sites (e.g., Roku’s developer forums, blogs, message boards, community pages), and accounts on third-party social networking sites. Information posted in these venues may be available to the public.  Please be mindful of your own privacy needs and those of others as you choose what to disclose and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public.
B. Information Collected Automatically Through the Roku Services
1. Device Information
We may receive information about the browsers and devices you use to access the Internet, including our services, such as device types and models, unique identifiers including advertising identifiers (e.g., for Roku Devices, the Advertising Identifier associated with that device), MAC address, IP address, operating system type and version, browser type and language, Wi-Fi network name and connection data, and information about other devices connected to the same network. We may also gather the WiFi MAC addresses, country code, and broadcast signal strengths of your router and other Wi-Fi routers in your area. For Roku Devices, we may also collect the name of the retailer to whom your Roku Device was shipped, various quality measures, error logs, software version numbers, and device status (including the status of battery-powered accessories). When you enable Bluetooth while using Roku Services, we may collect your Bluetooth usage, such as connection quality, the name of the device connected to your Roku Device, and the start and stop time of your connection.
We may infer your general location information and internet service provider from the device information we collect (for example, IP address and MAC address may be used to infer your geographic area). You may also choose to provide your location to enhance the functionality of your Smart Home Devices.
2. Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies
We and our business partners, such as analytics and advertising partners, collect information about your online activities over time and across different online services. For example, we use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, SDK, device identifiers or similar technologies to recognize you when you use Roku Services, and to collect information such as the number of visits, which features and pages are popular, and to measure your browsing activities. These technologies allow us to optimize the operation of our services, including by allowing us to ensure our services are functioning properly, improve and personalize the services, and to provide, personalize, and measure advertisements.
Similarly, we and our third-party service providers use e-mail tracking technologies to monitor the success of e-mail campaigns (for example, to track whether an email was opened and record how many e-mails in a campaign were opened).
3. Activity, Location, and Usage Information on Roku Services
We receive information about your interactions with the Roku Services, such as your browsing history, search history, search results, audio information when you use voice-enabled features, interactions with content and ads, interactions with other features of our platform, and settings and preferences. When you access streaming services on a Roku device or Roku’s Channels on other devices, we may collect information about your activities, like the apps you install or access (including usage statistics such as what apps you access, the time you access them, and how long you interact with them), and information about the videos and other content you select and stream within these streaming services.
When you use a smart TV with our operating system (e.g., a Roku TV model) with the Smart TV Experience enabled, we use Automatic Content Recognition (
“ACR”
) technology to collect information about what you watch or access (e.g., the programs, video games, ads and channels you viewed or accessed, and the date, time and duration of the viewing or access) via your TV’s antenna, cable box, game console, media player or other devices connected to your TV, and we may also collect additional information about the videos and other content you stream. The data collected while the Smart TV Experience is enabled may vary depending on your TV’s model and when you enabled the Smart TV Experience. For information specific to your TV, please see the
Privacy
>
Smart TV Experience
section of your TV’s settings menu. If you disable this setting on your TV, Roku will not use ACR on that TV, but Roku still receives information about your interactions and streaming activities on that TV through other methods.
If you use the Roku Media Player to view your video or photo files or listen to your music files, Roku will collect data about the files viewed within the Roku Media Player, such as codecs, and other metadata of the local files you play through the Roku Media Player.
If you use Roku’s mobile app as a remote control or to otherwise interact with another device, we will collect the device identifier of the device with which the mobile app interacts.
Roku's Advertising Services
Through Roku’s advertising services, we receive information about when, where and how an ad was displayed, and other contextual information about when the ad was served, and your clicks and any other information you provide when you interact with the ad (such as your phone number in order to receive a coupon code, your zip code to find an advertiser’s closest locations or information related to the purchases you make through our shoppable ads). For example, when Roku provides advertising services in Third-Party Channels, Roku receives information related to the ad.
When you visit websites, apps, streaming services, and connected devices (including Smart TVs and mobile devices) to which Roku provides advertising or measurement and analytics services, we may receive information about your activities, including information related to content you view, the date and time of your visits, how you interact with these websites, apps and devices, and how you interact and respond to ads. If our advertising partners choose to disclose this information to us, we will also receive other information connected to your interactions with these ads or advertisers, such as your name, email address, phone number, postal address, IP address, user agent and other online identifiers (such as any subscription ID or advertising IDs) that the advertiser has associated with you. For more information about how these advertisers use your data, please review their privacy policies.
4. Information We Receive from Third Parties
We collect information about you from other sources for the purposes described in Part II of this Privacy Policy, including to provide you a tailored user experience and advertising that may be of interest to you. For example, we may collect information from the following sources:
Third parties who distribute Roku’s Channels on their devices
. For example, if you access Roku’s Channels on media streaming devices or mobile devices from other companies, they may provide us IP addresses, device IDs or other unique identifiers, and user actions that relate to Roku.
Third parties whose services are available through the Roku Services
.  For example, Third Party Channels may provide us IP addresses, device IDs or other unique identifiers, account status, services. If you add a third-party payment service to your Roku account, we will receive payment and billing information about you (e.g., your payment method) from that service.
Linked Account Providers
. If you link a third-party account (such as Alexa, Google Home, or Google Photos) to your Roku account, Roku will receive data from that provider such as voice command transcriptions (in the case of voice assistant accounts), and photo album metadata (in the case of photo storage accounts).
Data providers, ad networks and other advertising partners
. These business partners may provide IP addresses, device IDs, other unique identifiers, and information about you, such as information about your online activities, interests, household information, demographics, health, and wellness information.
Advertisers
.  Advertisers that show ads through Roku’s advertising services may also provide data about individuals to us to personalize and measure ads through Roku’s advertising services, and for other purposes described in Part II.
Service providers
. We outsource some of our operations to our service providers and vendors. For example, payment service providers that provide us payment or balance information, and ad fraud vendors that provide IP addresses to help us identify potentially suspicious activities.
Sweepstakes and Contests
. If you enter one of our sweepstakes or contests hosted on a third-party platform, we will receive information about you and the information you provide to enter.
We may also receive your personal information from other individuals if they have referred you as described under Part I, Section A(5), above.
5. Information Collected by Streaming Service Providers
If you install, access or use a streaming service through us (such as a Third-Party Channel or third-party streaming service within The Roku Channel), or if you conduct a voice search in one of these services, or when you access these apps through any available hbbtv features on your Roku TV model's remote, you may also be interacting with that provider directly, and the provider and its advertising partners may collect information about your Roku Devices (including unique identifiers, IP addresses, and device settings like language and time zone) and your usage of their service (e.g., videos, ads and other content you search, select and stream within their service, and audio information when you use some of the voice-enabled features). These streaming services may collect some of the information described in this section when their app is installed but not actively streaming.
These streaming services may also receive your Roku account registration information (if you choose to subscribe to their service), and information about your interactions with the Roku Services, as further described in Part III, B below. You should review the privacy policy for the streaming service you want to install or stream to understand how your data is used by that provider.
6. Information Collected by Providers of Linked Accounts
If you link your Roku Device or Roku account to a non-Roku service (e.g., Google Photos, Alexa and Google Assistant), you are choosing to have the provider of that service collect information about you and your Roku Device, which may include device type and name, device identifiers, its state (e.g., whether the device is powered on, whether the device is playing video), names of installed streaming service apps, and the names of your device HDMI ports. If you direct a virtual assistant to display content (such as the feed of your Roku home security camera), you are authorizing Roku to provide that information to the virtual assistant provider to carry out your request. For information about how these providers use this data, please review their privacy policies.
7. Information Collected by Third-Party Platforms and Devices You Use to Access the Roku Services
If you access our services, such as Roku’s Channels, on platforms and devices operated by other companies, including third-party smart TVs, streaming devices or mobile phones, these companies may also collect information about you. You should review the privacy policy for these companies to understand how your data is used by them and their partners.
Part II. Information Usage
We may combine the information we collect about you and use it to derive other information and inferences about you. We use the information we collect and derive for the following purposes:
Support, Maintenance and Fulfillment
. We use your information to provide and maintain the Roku Services, and to process and fulfill your requests or orders;
Improvement of Products and Services
. We use your information to understand and analyze our user base and how you use the Roku Services, to improve and enhance the Roku Services (including building correlations for use in Roku’s advertising services in order to better serve our advertisers), and to develop new products, services, features and functionalities;

We use your information to create online identifiers, measure and understand the reach, viewership, and effectiveness of advertising, and to provide advertising analytics and reporting. We also help advertisers and advertising partners reach the desired audience and understand, measure and improve their ad campaigns. We associate the browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, streaming players, connected TVs, and computers) used by the same individual or household for purposes of advertising to that individual or household on different browsers or devices. This allows, for example, ads you see on your tablet to be based on activities you engaged in on your Roku TV.

Part III. Our Disclosure of Information

Part IV. Information Access and Choices
A. General Requests
If you have a Roku account, you may view and update certain contact and billing information we have about you by logging into your account on
Roku.com
. If you otherwise wish to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any of your personal information held by us, please click
here
. However, we may decline requests that are unreasonable, prohibited by law, or are not required to be honored by applicable law.
B. Email Marketing Choices
Our marketing emails tell you how to opt out of receiving further marketing emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails, such as emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you, and, as allowed by applicable law, requests for your participation in surveys. You may also opt out of receiving marketing emails from us by unchecking the box
here
.
C. Personalized Advertising Choices
If you are logged in to your Roku account, you can manage your preference for personalized ads from Roku by adjusting the “Personalized Ads” setting in your account. You can access this setting in the Privacy section of the Settings menu of your Roku players and Roku TV models, or on our website
here
. When you disable this setting, we will not personalize your ads while you are accessing our services using your Roku account. You will still see ads, but they will be less relevant to you. Ads you see can still be “contextual” – for example, they can be based on the subject matter of what you are viewing or the time of day. If you are streaming a Third-Party Channel on a Roku player or Roku TV model, that app may not respond to this setting. It may offer its own settings to address ad personalization and you should review the privacy policy provided by the Third-Party Channel to understand your choices. You can also reset the Advertising Identifier of your Roku player or Roku TV model by choosing “Reset Advertising Identifier” in the device settings.
If you use Roku’s services without logging into your Roku account, or if you access other websites, apps, or devices where Roku provides advertising services, you can exercise your choices below.  Each of these opt-out mechanisms below opts you out of Roku’s personalizing of ads only for that specific device or browser and will not affect activities or personalized advertising on other browsers or different devices.
on websites by accessing the opt-out
here
;
on mobile apps by using any limit ad tracking settings offered by your mobile operating system; and
on Smart TVs, set top boxes, media streaming devices and other OTT platforms from other companies by using any limit ad tracking (or similar) settings offered by that platform, if one is available.
You can opt out of personalized ads from third parties on the Roku Sites through our opt-out tool included in Roku’s cookie policy
here
. This tool opts you out of personalized advertising only for the specific browser from which you opt out and will not affect activities or targeted advertising on other browsers or different devices.
D. Choices Regarding “Smart TV Experience” and Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) on Roku TV Models
If you would like to disable the Smart TV Experience on your Roku TV model, please visit your Roku TV model’s Settings menu (
Settings > Privacy > Smart TV Experience
) and de-select “Automatic Content Recognition (ACR)”.
E. Voice Feature Choices

Settings > Privacy > Voice)
for controls regarding apps’ access to the microphone on your remote control or mobile device. You can also disable Roku’s retention of voice recordings captured on your remote control or mobile device by logging into your account on
Roku.com
and visiting the Voice Settings page.  For Roku remotes with a hands-free voice feature, you can disable that feature.  Please refer to the product information accompanying these remotes or our support website for further instructions.
F. Smart Home Device Data
If you own a Roku Smart Home device, you can manage device settings and the retention and transfer of device content from the Roku Smart Home Mobile App and/or the Roku Smart Home webpage. You may be asked to provide video and audio recordings to help Roku and its partners improve their products and services but are not required to provide consent.
Part V:  Data Storage, Transfers and Security
A. Security:
We use industry-standard methods of securing electronic databases of personal information. However, you should know that no company, including Roku, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.

While such information is outside of your country of residence, it is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country. We will protect all personal information we obtain in accordance with this Privacy Policy and take reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated lawfully.
C. Retention:
Personal information we collect may be retained for as long as needed to fulfill legitimate business purposes, including the purposes outlined in “Information Usage” under Part II, or for a time period specifically required or allowed by applicable regulations or laws.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

Your Privacy Choices
Do not share or sell my personal information
We disclose personal information as described in our
privacy policy
for different purposes, including to bring you more relevant ads, help you discover content and provide a more tailored experience to you on our services. Some of these disclosures may be considered a "sharing" of personal information for "cross-context behavioral advertising" or "targeted advertising", or a "sale" of personal information under relevant law. Based on where you live, you may have the right to opt out of these disclosures by us, as well as our use of your personal information for targeted advertising, by enabling this setting.
"Cross-context behavioral advertising" and "targeted advertising" generally mean using your online activities across non-affiliated websites or services to decide what ads you might be interested in seeing. For example, if you frequented the websites of car manufacturers, then we may show you an ad for a car. Therefore, opting out of these disclosures means that you will still see ads, but they will be less relevant to you, and you may see the same ads more frequently.

Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
