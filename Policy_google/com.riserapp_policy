Children’s Privacy
Cardo is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities. Cardo does not intentionally target its website to children under the age of 16 years (“Minors”). Accordingly, we do not intend to collect personal information from anyone we know to be a Minor.

We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website before submitting personal information.
Profile
You choose your handle and what information you enter into the Cardo Website. Entering information that others can see makes it available to them.
