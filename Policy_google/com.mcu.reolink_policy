Reolink Innovation Limited (“we” or “Reolink”) values and protects user privacy. We are highly aware of the importance of your personal information and are committed to protecting such information in a secure and controlled manner by strictly complying with legal and regulatory requirements and referring to proven industry security standards. For this purpose, we have developed the Reolink Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to help you understand in detail how we collect, use, process, share, store, and protect your personal information during your use of our products and/or services and the rights you have in such process.
Before you start using our products and/or services, it is important that you read this Policy carefully (especially the highlighted terms), and fully understand and agree to the content herein. You have the right to refuse this Policy, but if you do so, we will not be able to provide you with our products and/or services as it serves as an important part of the
Reolink User Service Agreement
. When you choose to (re)use our products and/or services, you will be deemed to have accepted and acknowledged this Policy as it is an essential prerequisite for the rendering of our products and/or services.
Your agreement to the Policy indicates that you understand that we will collect certain personal information from you in specific service scenarios, but it does not mean that we will collect and process all of the personal information covered herein once you agree to this Policy and use our products and/or services. When it comes to additional business functions that require the processing of your non-essential personal information, we will ask for your consent separately. Some of the concepts might seem a little technical, and we've tried our best to explain them in a simple and clear way. Please read and understand this Policy before use. If you have any questions, please
contact us.
I. Scope of Application
(1) This Policy applies to the official website (
https://reolink.com/
) and all its subsites (collectively, “Website”), products, mobile applications (Reolink App), computer applications, cloud storage services, technical support, and other services provided by Reolink (collectively, “products and/or services”).
(2) This Policy does not apply to any third-party websites and their services linked to or from the Website. Please read the relevant privacy policy carefully when using the aforementioned services.
(3) “Personal information” herein refers to information recorded electronically or by other means, which can be used to identify or relate to a natural person, excluding the de-identified data. The type and scope of personal information we collect vary with the products and/or services you use and how you interact with us. Please refer to the specific product or service functions. You have the right not to provide us with this information, but in some scenarios, if you choose not to, we will not be able to provide you with the corresponding products or services or respond to and resolve your problems.
(4) Some services may require you to enable the corresponding permissions on your device. You may refer to “(IV) Reolink App and Client Services” under “II. How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information” in this Policy to learn about the specific permissions involved with Reolink App. You can also go to “Settings > Application Permissions” on your device to enable or disable the permissions at any time through as needed. In particular, even if we have obtained your access permissions, we will only collect your information when it is necessary for the rendering of relevant functions or services.
(5) For better user experience, we are constantly improving our technology. As a result, we may from time to time introduce new or optimized functions and hence may need to collect and use other personal information or change the purposes or methods of data use. In this regard, we will separately explain to you the scope, purposes, and methods of collection and use of the corresponding information by Policy updates, pop-up windows, page prompts, etc. You will have the right to agree or disagree with such changes, and we will only collect or use your information after obtaining your express consent. During this process, if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, you can contact us through the contact information provided herein. We will reply to you as soon as possible.
II. How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information
According to
Reolink User Service Agreement
signed between you and us, in order to provide you with the corresponding functions of our products and/or services, we promise to follow the data minimization principle when collecting and using your personal information and not to use your personal information beyond the purposes of the Reolink User Services Agreement and this Policy unless for the purpose of rendering the abovementioned functions. You will be required to voluntarily submit to us or authorize us to collect and use your personal information as follows.
(I) Registration, Account Log-In and Verification
When you register and log in to your Reolink account, you need to provide your email address, password, and in some scenarios, a verification code. If you refuse to provide them, you will not be able to register successfully. Additionally:
(1) When submitting community posts, making product reviews, and sharing videos, you may choose to fill in your nickname, profile picture, and name as needed. Refusal to provide such information will not affect your access to these functions or services.
(2) You may choose to fill in the country according to your own needs in order to use our personalized services (such as displaying local prices for products). Refusal to provide such information will not affect your use of the basic functions of your account, unless otherwise stated.

email address
and
country
registered for your third-party account, for the purpose of binding it to your Reolink account. For personal information that we need but the third-party cannot provide, we will inform you and ask you to provide it through system prompts, etc.

(3) When making a payment, you can choose the payment service provided by our partner third-party payment institutions (including PayPal and other payment channels).

serial number of the product
. The product serial number is the unique basic product information and is the basic information that must be collected to bind the product and further provide you with Reolink Cloud storage service.
(2) When video recordings are uploaded from your device to your Reolink Cloud, you are the controller and Reolink is the data processor of your cloud videos. Only those who have access to your Reolink account (you and those authorized by you) may log in to your Reolink Cloud account anytime to view, download, and/or delete such videos. Based on the contract, the system will automatically delete the expired cloud videos.

In addition, we may, from time to time, push surveys to you or ask for your review after you have used a product or service. We will record the contact information, problems or suggestions you submit while using these functions to improve our products and/or services and enhance your experience.
Please note that the comments, reviews or other contents you post on Reolink are publicly visible. To avoid or minimize potential risks, we therefore recommend that you be careful when disclosing your personal information in your posts.

When personal data is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA), we take special safeguards to ensure that the protection travels with the data, including having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA.
The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country. And we may not provide the same level of protection as those in your country.
