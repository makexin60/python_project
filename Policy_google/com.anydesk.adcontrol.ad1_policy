If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our data protection officer at

Potsdamer Straße 3

dpo@anydesk.com
.
Legal basis
AnyDesk processes your data in accordance with the data  protection regulations of the German
Federal Data    Protection Act
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - "BDSG") in the  version valid as of May 25, 2018 and the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation  - "GDPR").
The relevant legal basis for the processing is stated in the  information on the individual categories of data.
Categories of data
AnyDesk processes different categories of personal data. In  the following sections, the data is presented according to the  group of data subjects, the respective purpose, and the relevant  legal basis.
Customers and business partners
Insofar as we are in a contractual, quasi-contractual or  pre-contractual business relationship with you, i.e. if you are  already a customer, business partner or are interested in such a  legal relationship ("contractual partner"), we process the  following data as necessary:
Personal data (e.g. names, addresses, gender, company, location)
Payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history)
Contract data (e.g. subject matter of the contract, type of license, term, customer category, customer ID, login    information)
Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content,    access times, time and duration of the respective remote data    connection (session), data volume transferred, online status of    the client)
Meta-/communication data (e.g. device information, device ID, IP and MAC addresses)
Content of communication directed at us (e.g. product or contract inquiries, error messages, responses to our    surveys)
We will inform you in a transparent manner before or during  data collection as to extent od data that is required for this  purpose. We process the data:
to be able to address you in communication,
to answer your questions,
to establish and fulfill our contractual obligations,
to protect our rights,
to protect against unauthorized use and misuse of our offers,
for related administrative tasks, and
for the purposes of business organization.
Your data is processed, in particular, to allow you to select,  acquire or order the selected products (licenses to use our  software and any associated services), as well as to enable  payment and processing. During the registration process required  to acquire a license, we will create an account for you on in our  systems ("customer account" or "user account"). During  registration, we will point out which of the above-mentioned  details are required for this purpose, in particular to verify  registration or the respective use of our login functions and the  use of the user account, and to prevent any possible misuse of  the customer account. The customer account (my.anydesk.com) gives  you access to your connection data, the contract/license  information, information about the AnyDesk clients that are  linked to the license, your master data as a customer, invoices,  and any settings for payment methods. AnyDesk customer accounts  are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. We may  use email or in-app messaging to inform users about processes  relevant to their user account (such as technical changes) or to  invite them to participate in surveys.
The legal basis for the processing is therefore:
For contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries -    Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR
With regard to legal obligation - Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR
Otherwise, with regard to our legitimate interests - Art. 6    (1) (f) GDPR
We do not store any content of the respective remote data  connection (session data) beyond the required scope of data  transfer. The customer can create a chat log or a session  recording, which is then only stored locally on the customer's  computer. AnyDesk does not access these session data.
Users of our website
Log files
When users visit our website, we (or our web hosting provider)  collect user access data (so-called server log files). The server  log files can include the following data:
The address and name of the websites and files accessed
Date and time of access
Data volumes transferred
Notification of successful access
Browser type and version
User's operating system
Referrer URL (the previously visited page)
IP address
This processing takes place to ensure problem-free connection  to and smooth use of our website, and to ensure system security  and stability. In particular, we do not use your data to draw  conclusions about your person. Information of this kind may be  statistically evaluated by us in order to optimize our website  and the technology behind it. This processing takes place in  accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR on the basis of our  legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality  of our website and preventing the misuse of our services.
Cookies
In addition, we use so-called cookies, i.e. text files that  are stored on a user's computer by a browser and contain  information about this user during or after his visit to a  website, which may be processed by us. This information includes,  for example, the login status, pages or media accessed,  pseudonymous online identification ("user" or "AnyDesk IDs"), the  content of a shopping cart, the licensed product selected, or the  user-specific settings on our websites.
Please note that there are different types of cookies with  different purposes:
First-party cookies are set by us.
Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers    (so-called third parties) to process user information.
Temporary cookies (also: session cookies) are deleted at the    latest after a user has left a website and closed his    browser.
Permanent cookies remain stored on the user's computer even    after the browser is closed. This allows, for example, saving the    login status or displaying the user-preferred content again    directly when the user visits the website later. User interests    used for audience measurement or marketing purposes may also be    stored in such a cookie.
Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies    are absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to    store logins or other user entries, or for security reasons).
Statistical, online marketing and personalization cookies,    on the other hand, are used to measure audience and to display    content to users that matches their potential interests according    to the stored data about access to certain content (so-called    tracking). If we use these types of cookies or tracking    technologies, we will inform you of this beforehand as part of    the process of obtaining your consent.
Depending on the type of cookies, we use them to process your  personal data either on the basis of a previously given consent  in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR, on the basis of our  legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (e.g.  to support the operation of our website and its improvement), or  because the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our  contractual obligations in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (b)  GDPR.
Before we process your data or have them processed in the  context of the use of cookies, when you access the page, we will  inform you about which cookies we use and will ask for your  consent, which can be revoked at any time (cookie opt-in tool or  banner). Before the consent is given, only cookies which are  absolutely necessary for the operation of our website may be  used.
In addition to the option of revoking your consent at any  time, you can also view our website without cookies. Please note  that Internet browsers are regularly set to accept cookies. In  general, you can disable the use of cookies at any time via your  browser settings. Please use the help functions of your Internet  browser to find out how you can change these settings (individual  functions of our website, such as registration and use of the  customer portal, may not work if you have disabled the use of  cookies). With regard to tracking, you can also object to the use  of cookies via a variety of services, e.g. via the websites
https://optout.aboutads.info
and
https://www.youronlinechoices.com/
(
"opt-out").
Registration and use of customer account
In the context of the registrations and use of the customer  accounts, we store the IP addresses of the customers together  with the access times in order to be able to verify the  registration and to prevent possible misuse of the customer  account. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1)  (f) GDPR.
Contact forms
When you visit the AnyDesk website, you can use a form to  contact us, in particular to request technical support. In  addition to the technical details listed in there, you must  provide your first and last name, email address, customer ID, the  text and the factual context of the inquiry. The personal data  transferred to us in this context will only be used to process  the respective inquiries. The legal basis for the data processing  is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
Surveys
We rely on the voluntary feedback from our customers and  website users in order to continuously improve our services and  products. For this reason, we also use technical services and  form functions of third-party providers, which we integrate into  our website, in order to establish contact and to design specific  surveys. In doing so, we collect the requested data, which you  enter in the form, as well as meta and communication data (e.g.  IP address), which we can assign to your customer and contract  data.
The legal basis for the use of these functions is our  legitimate interest in the target group-oriented and flexibly  adaptable presentation of contact forms on specific topics in  order to be able to efficiently analyze the review of our  services by our customers and to improve these services (Art. 6  (1) (f) GDPR). With regard to the collection of your voluntary  provided information when using these survey functions, the legal  basis is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.  Participating in the surveys is purely voluntary and is not  required for our performance of the contract.
Newsletters (email marketing)
You have the option of subscribing to a newsletter, i.e.  receiving emails from us, via our website. The specific content  of the newsletter is based on the description provided during  subscription (e.g. special offers, products and events);  otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services  and our company.
In order to subscribe, you just need to provide your email  address. It will only be used to send you the newsletter you have  subscribed to by email. After subscribing, you will receive an  email to this email address, in which you will be asked to  confirm your subscription in order to prevent someone from  subscribing with a different email address ("double-opt-in  procedure"). We record all newsletter subscriptions in order to  prove the legal conformity of the subscription process. This  includes storing the time of registration and confirmation as  well as the IP address.
Newsletters are sent on the basis of the recipient's consent,  which can be withdrawn at any time (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR), or, if  such consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate  interests in direct marketing (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR), if and to  the extent that this is permitted by law (e.g. in the case of  advertising to existing customers). The subscription process is  recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose  of proving that it has been conducted properly (Art. 6 (1) (f)  GDPR). If we commission a service provider to send emails, this  is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient  and secure mailing system (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
Please note:
The newsletters may contain a so-called  web beacon (also called tracking pixel), i.e. a pixel-sized file  that is retrieved from our server or from the server of a mailing  service provider commissioned by us when the newsletter is  opened. As part of this retrieval, we collect technical  information, such as information about the browser and your  system, as well as your IP address and the time of retrieval.
On the one hand, this information is used to improve our  newsletters on the basis of the technical data or to determine  target groups and their reading behavior on the basis of their  retrieval locations (which can be determined using the IP  address) or access times.
On the other hand, this analysis includes determining whether  or not the newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and  which links are clicked on. For technical reasons, this  information can be assigned to the individual email addresses of  the newsletter recipients. However, neither we nor the mailing  service provider commissioned by us will make such an assignment;  the data is evaluated exclusively to adapt our contents to the  reading habits of our users. This evaluation takes place, subject  to the express consent of the user to receive the newsletter, on  the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of using a  user-friendly and secure newsletter system which both serves our  business interests and meets the expectations of the users (Art.  6 (1) (f) GDPR).
You can unsubscribe from our newsletters at any time, i.e.  revoke your consent or object to further receipt of newsletters.  A link to unsubscribe from our newsletters can also be found at  the end of each newsletter.
Plugins, embedded functions and content
We integrate various functions and content from third-party  providers (e.g. graphics, videos or social media buttons and  posts) in our website in order to make relevant information about  our company and our services easily accessible to you as a user  of our website. For this purpose, the third-party providers  process the IP addresses of the users, since without the IP  address they would not be able to send the content to their  browsers.
Social media buttons
When you click on one of our social media buttons, the data is  transferred to the corresponding social network via the so-called  "Shariff" application. Instead of your browser, a connection with  the server of the respective social network platform is  established by the server on which our website is located, i.e.  initially no personal data of the user is passed on to the social  network provider. A "Shariff" button establishes direct contact  between the social network and you as a user only when you  actively click on the "Share" button. You can recognize the  respective provider of the plugin by the marking on the box or in  the circle above its respective first letter or the logo. More  information about the "Shariff project" can be obtained from the  developers of the ct magazine:
https://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html
.
Pixel tags
In addition, third-party providers may use so-called pixel  tags (also known as web beacons) in order to evaluate visitor  flows. This exclusively pseudonymous information may also be  stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain technical  information about the browser and operating system, websites to  be referred to, the time of visit, and other details on the use  of our website, and may also be linked to such information from  other sources. With regard to the legal basis and the individual  opt-out options, please refer to the information on the use of  cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Video integration
We integrate videos from the YouTube platform on our website,  in particular via a plugin, in order to provide you with visually  rich information about our products and technical processes. In  doing so, we use the YouTube "No Cookies" function, i.e. we have  enabled the "
privacy-enhanced"
function. Therefore,  videos are accessed via
youtube-nocookie.com
instead of
youtube.com
. When the relevant pages are accessed,  however, the IP address and other data mentioned under "Log  files" are transferred and thus, in particular, information is  provided as to which of our Internet pages you have visited.  However, this information cannot be associated with you if you  are permanently signed in to YouTube or another Google service  when you access the page. When you start playing such an  integrated video by clicking on it, the YouTube privacy-enhanced  mode on your device only stores cookies that do not contain any  personally identifiable information, unless you are currently  signed in to a Google service. These cookies can be blocked via  certain browser settings and extensions. With regard to the legal  basis, please also refer to the information on the use of cookies  in this Privacy Policy.
Interactive maps
Furthermore, we integrate Google Maps on our website in order  to include an interactive map directly on the website to  determine our company location and to allow you to conveniently  use the map function for better navigation. In certain versions,  the integration means that when the user accesses the website,  Google may set cookies with which a connection to the Google  network is established. The legal basis for the integration of  Google Maps and the associated data transfer to Google is your  consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Please refer to the information on  the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
eRecruiting
We also integrate a plugin for the "Prescreen" eRecruiting  system on our website. This allows us to place job advertisements  under the ".jobbase.io" domain and receive and manage  applications. Cookies may be used on our website to record users  of application forms. The legal basis for this is your consent  (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Please refer to the information on the use  of cookies in this Privacy Policy. When you go to our application  page under
https://anydesk.com/en/career/jobs
and  click the "Apply Now" button, the IP address as well as the  information listed under "Log files" will be transferred to the  server of the third-party provider and you will be forwarded to  our current job offers on their server. The legal basis for this  is § 26 BDSG in conjunction with Art. 88 GDPR, as well as (for  the implementation of pre-contractual measures) Art. 6 (1) (b)  GDPR. For more information, please refer to "Job offers and  application process".
Protection of the website
We use the "Wordfence Security" service to protect our website  from viruses and malware and to fend off attacks by computer  criminals. IP addresses are stored on the third-party servers, in  particular, to protect against so-called brute-force and DDoS  attacks. IP addresses classified as harmless are placed on a  white list. The protection of our website and its users  constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6  (1) (f) GDPR. In addition, the plugin uses cookies to recognize  whether the visitor of our website is a human or a robot. In this  respect, please refer to the information on the use of cookies in  this Privacy Policy. The Live Traffic View option of the plugin  is disabled as it is not mandatory.
Multilingual design
We also use the multilingual WPML plugin in order to offer you  our website in different languages. The design of our website  that is comprehensible for as many users as possible constitutes  a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.  For this purpose, when you visit our website, WPML sets a cookie  in order to store the language setting you have selected. In this  respect, please refer to the information on the use of cookies in  this Privacy Policy.
SEO
We use the YOAST SEO plugin to support the search engine  optimization of our website. This plugin ensures the technical  optimization of our website for search engines while supporting  us in the development of content on our website. This is done to  make sure that customer groups interested in our offers can  easier find us on the Internet, which is a legitimate interest  within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The plugin uses  cookies. In this respect, please refer to the information on the  use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Web analysis
For the evaluation of visitor flows on our website, we may  record the behavior, interests or demographic information of the  users of our website as pseudonymous values. Based on this  audience analysis, we can, for example, identify under which IP  address, at what time and from where certain contents of our  website or its functions are most frequently accessed, or invite  the user to use them again. This also allows us to better  understand which functions or content of our website require  optimization (because they are not accessed as often or not at  all). For this purpose, we create and store user profiles in a  file (a so-called cookie), or we may use similar procedures with  the same purpose.
On the one hand, to protect the users, we use a so-called IP  masking procedure (pseudonymization by shortening the IP address)  when storing the users' IP addresses. On the other hand, in the  context of web analysis and optimization, no real user ID data is  stored (i.e. neither email addresses nor names), but strictly  pseudonyms. Therefore, we do not know the actual identity of the  users. We use the stored data exclusively for the aforementioned  purposes in their pseudonymous user profiles. With regard to the  legal basis and the individual opt-out options, please refer to  the information on the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Online marketing
User profiles can be created and stored in a file (cookie) to  display advertising content or to market advertising space  (online marketing). These data can be used to determine the  users' potential interests and to measure the effectiveness of  online marketing. The stored data may include content accessed,  websites visited, online networks used, as well as communication  partners and technical information, such as the IP address, the  browser used, the computer system used, and information on usage  times. If users have consented to their location data being  collected, this data may also be processed.
The following shall also apply in the case of online  marketing: We use a so-called IP masking procedure  (pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) when storing IP  addresses. In the context of web analysis and optimization, no  real user ID data is stored (i.e. neither email addresses nor  names), but strictly pseudonyms.
Therefore, we do not know the actual identity of the users. We  use these stored data exclusively for the aforementioned purposes  in their pseudonymous user profiles. In exceptional cases, real  ID data may be assigned to the user profiles if the respective  user is a member of a social network whose online marketing  process we use and with whose providers the users have entered  into agreements (e.g. by giving consent during registration),  according to which the network may link the user profiles with  the aforementioned data.
Otherwise, we only have access to summarized information about  the success of our advertisements, i.e. we can measure which of  our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion  (i.e. to an inquiry or a contract with us).
In general, the data stored in the cookies (or using  comparable processes) may also be read on other websites (which  use the same online marketing process) and, in turn, may be  analyzed for the purpose of displaying content, supplemented with  further data if necessary, and stored on the server of the online  marketing process provider.
With regard to the legal basis for online marketing processes  and the individual opt-out options, please refer to the  information on the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Review procedures and widgets
We use the so-called review widgets on the AnyDesk website to  allow our customers to review providers and products, and for our  own quality management. In the process, a reference to the  results of the review of our products by customers offered by a  service provider named in there is integrated via a linked page  or image element. When the image element is called up, the  service provider's web server automatically saves the IP address  and the information listed under "Log files". Further personal  data may be transferred to the respective service provider if you  have decided to review our products according to their terms and  conditions.
This data processing takes place on the basis of Art. 6 (1)  (f) GDPR and is necessary to safeguard our legitimate interest in  transparent review management and to ensure that we only publish  reviews by users who can actually report on their own experiences  as our customers and users of our products.
Customer Relationship Management
We use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to  maintain our customer relationships as part of our online  presence. They help us to effectively systematize, manage and  document product-relevant information offers and communication  with our customers. This is done using software solutions which  integrate the following aspects when using our website:
Contact management
Email marketing
Social media publishing
Web analysis
Online marketing
Registration services (our user account my.anydesk.com)
Customer review management
With regard to the legal basis and the individual opt-out  options, please refer to the information on the aforementioned  topics and the services used in this Privacy Policy.
In the case that you are already a registered customer of  AnyDesk, the Web Analysis and Online Marketing services may  contain specific information about your customer, contact and  contract information that shall be linked with your account. The  legal basis for the use of this personal data is our legitimate  interests in improving our website to make it easier for the  customers to use it and to provide additional information and  offers pertaining to our services (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
Content Delivery Network
In order to deliver the content of our website, i.e. also large  media files (such as graphics, videos or program scripts) to you  faster and more securely, we use regionally distributed servers  of a so-called Content Delivery Network (CDN), which are  connected via the Internet. In doing so, we establish a  connection to the server of the CDN service provider and transfer  your IP address there. If you are signed in with an existing user  account with this service provider while visiting our website,  this service provider can also associate your visit to our  website with your user behavior. The legal basis for the use of a  CDN and the associated data transfer are our legitimate interests  in improving our website to make it easier for the customers to  use it (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
In addition, the service provider can send further cookies to  your browser. In this respect, please refer to the information on  the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.

We may also contact you via in-app messages, in compliance  with the legal requirements, if the communication is necessary  for the purposes of administration or use of the application, or  to inform you about changes or improvements to our products or  completely new products, to invite you to participate in surveys,  or to give you tips on how to get the most out of our products.  For this purpose, we will process the above-mentioned usage data  as well as
your customer ID
. In the course of  deciding whether and how we should contact and inform you, we  will also process the type of license you have, the language and  version of the product you are using and/or your country, and we  may also use data that we have collected through web  analysis.
The data processing necessary for the verification of the  usage authorization and the provision of the functionalities of  the application itself serves to fulfill contractual obligations  (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR). In addition, we process data if this is  required to secure the application or protect our legitimate  business interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR; e.g. collection of data  for the purpose of optimizing the application, or for security  purposes). Otherwise, data will only be processed to the extent  to which you as the user have expressly given your consent (Art.  6 (1) (a) GDPR).
Please note that the opt-out or revocation of the respective  authorizations may affect the functionality of our  application.
Google Speech-to-Text
In our app you will find the Google Speech-to-Text function. This is operated by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereinafter "Google").
This function is used to compose voice messages and send them to the Google Cloud for conversion into character strings.
The Google Speech-to-Text function is provided as an option.
Data is therefore only transmitted to Google when you press the microphone icon. This activates the microphone you are using and you now have the option of converting the spoken language into text.
Purpose
The purpose is to enable a more comfortable and user-friendly use of our app.
By converting the spoken words and sentences into text through Google Speech-to-Text, the processes are accelerated and simplified.
Legal basis
The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) f) DSGVO.
Our legitimate interest is to improve the functionality and usability of our app.
Recipients of the data
If you activate the microphone icon and make a voice input, Google receives the spoken sentence in order to convert it into text.
Google does not make the audio sent to the Speech-to-Text API available to anyone except as necessary to provide the Speech-to-Text API service. For example, it may be necessary to engage a third-party provider to provide some aspects of Google's services, such as data storage or transmission. In these cases, that provider is subject to contractual obligations of security and confidentiality. Google does not share your audio content with other parties for any other purpose.
Storage period
AnyDesk does not store your data as part of the Speech-to-Text function. Your data is passed directly to Google for conversion.
By default, Google does not log a customer's audio data or transcripts.
Google uses customer data to optimise and improve the speech recognition service, only if you sign up for the data logging program.
AnyDesk has chosen not to enroll in the data logging program in order to protect your personal data.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Google may retain audio files.
Provision mandatory or required
The provision of your personal data is voluntary and is not required by law or contract. However, without the data transfer to Google-Speech-to-Text, a conversion of your spoken language into text is not possible.
Objection
Please read the information about your right to object according to Art. 21 DSGVO below.
You can find more detailed information about data processing by Google in the Google Privacy Notice:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
and more detailed information about the Google Speech-to-Text function here:
https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text?hl=en
Telemetry-Data
Nature and purpose of processing
We collect and aggregate user telemetry data in connection with the provision of our services for the following purposes:
Evaluating interactions:
From the analysis on the use of the program interface and functions, insights can be gained into the acceptance of AnyDesk's graphical components and functionalities, so that areas with potential for optimization can be better identified in the context of further product development and the user experience can be improved.
Licenses and scamming
When using the free version of AnyDesk, usage data is reviewed to determine whether the user's behaviour patterns are in accordance with our “AnyDesk Free” Supplementary Terms and Conditions, see the section entitled "Automatic Decision Making (License Audit)".
Usage data is analysed to detect potential scamming cases at an early stage.
Evaluation of system data
Which hardware is used when AnyDesk software is in use provides us with important information for support purposes, for example, in the event of client-side performance problems. In addition, this information is used for further product development with regard to system modifications.
Type of data
Version of client, client ID, IP address, operating system, zone of relay (continent, later country), license, license name, network ID, first login, last login, user_identifier (user) hashed, information about interactions: Timestamp of interaction, message counter,
Category of interaction: click, drag, drop, etc.
Identifier for interaction: login, frontend, click events, undraggable, auto-update, etc., which window e.g. settings or window for file transfer (within the software).
Legal basis
The processing of telemetry data is based on the user's consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.
Storage period
The data will only be processed as long as your consent is given or for 2 years.
Provision mandatory or required
This consent is voluntary. If it is not given, you will not have any disadvantages. This consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
Revocation of consent
The revocation of consent is possible at any time with effect for the future and can be done by using the deactivation button.
Automated decision making
see paragraph -
"Automated decision making (license audit)"
.
Automatic decision making (license audit)
We offer personal users of our licensed products (i.e.  exclusively for uses that cannot be attributed to commercial or  self-employed professional activity) the option of a free  version, which can be used without setting up a user account  after simply downloading the application. In this case, we may  analyze your usage data (see above under "Applications") in line  with our "AnyDesk Free" Supplementary Terms and Conditions in  order to be able to assess whether your behavior pattern aligns  with the contractual purpose of use and thus to the selected  license type (license audit).
If, based on the results of this analysis, a fee-based license  is required, we reserve the right to restrict or even block your  access to our server services and we will ask you to purchase a  fee-based license. This takes place in an automated  decision-making process according to our system settings. You can  contact our Support at any time to ask us to reassess your user  behavior. We will inform you beforehand which information you  will need to provide.
The automated decision-making process as part of the license  audit and the use of automated mechanisms based on it (such as  the restriction or blocking of non-contractual uses) is essential  for the effective control of compliance and, if necessary, the  enforcement of our license terms with regard to the considerable  number of users of the free version of our application. Since the  use of the free version can only be financed through paid usage  relationships, this automated decision-making process is  necessary to fulfill our contractual services for private users,  as it must be effectively ensured that all users use our  application within the contractually agreed license scope. The  legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR in conjunction with  Art. 22 (2) (a) GDPR.
Social networks
Our company maintains an online presence within various social  networks (social media). We process data of active users of these  social networks in order to communicate with them there or to  offer information about AnyDesk. This processing takes place on  the basis of our legitimate interests in effective information  for users and communication with users under the applicable  framework conditions of the respective social medium in  accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. If you, as a user of the  respective social medium, are asked to give your consent to data  processing (e.g. by ticking a check box), the legal basis for  processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.
If it is technically possible for us to influence the  processing operations relevant to the data protection regulations  of the respective social media you have accessed, we will do so  in the sense of data minimization within the meaning of Art. 5  (1) (c) GDPR. However, please note that your use of the  respective social networks is subject to their terms and  conditions and data processing guidelines. Therefore, it cannot  be ruled out that your data may also be processed outside the  European Union. On the one hand, this could make it more  difficult to enforce your rights. On the other hand, the data  collected when using the functionalities of the social networks  may also be analyzed and processed for market research and  advertising purposes. This is done by storing your usage behavior  and the resulting interests and preferences as usage profiles in  cookies and by placing advertisements based on these profiles  inside and outside the social networks that presumably match your  interests (online marketing). If you as a user are also a member  of the respective social networks and are signed in to them, the  usage profiles may also store data that are independent of those  of the end devices you are using.
Information and notes on the respective forms of processing  and the opt-out options can be found in the privacy policies and  details of the operators of the respective networks. Since only  the respective operators of the social networks have access to  the data processed by them, you would also need to make requests  for information in this regard and assert your rights as a data  subject with them. We will be more than happy to help you if you  need our support in this regard.

Job offers and application process
As part of our application process, it is necessary for  applicants to provide us with the data required for their  professional assessment and selection. Which data this is in the  individual case can be seen from the respective job advertisement  or from the information provided in the relevant online forms.  When you apply for a job offer, we usually process the following  categories of personal data:
Contact information:
First and last name (title, if applicable)
Address
Phone number
Email address
Qualification-related information, in particular:
Academic achievements and other information contained in the    curriculum vitae, including information on prices and    scholarships and extracurricular achievements, information on    dissertation projects, information on education and professional    experience
Copies of diplomas and certificates
Photos attached to an application, if applicable
Information on (possibly only planned or hoped for) further    education and other career steps as well as professional focuses    and interests, if applicable
We collect these data directly from you and only process them  to the extent necessary for the application process. The legal  basis for this processing is § 26 BDSG in conjunction with Art.  88 GDPR, as well as (for the implementation of pre-contractual  measures with regard to freelancers) Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. The  data will be encrypted and transferred to us in accordance with  the latest state of the art. Please note that we may use  third-party services for the purpose of searching for and  selecting applicants (e.g. applicant management or recruitment  software and platforms). The legal basis for this is our  legitimate interest in an efficient and transparent job  advertisement (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR; please also refer to the  information in "Data recipients").
During the application process, special categories of personal  data within the meaning of Art. 9 (1) GDPR (e.g. health data,  such as severe impairment or ethnic origin) are processed only  for the purpose of exercising the obligations or rights arising  to us or the data subject from labor law and social security and  social protection law (Art. 9 (2) (b) GDPR), and otherwise to  protect the vital interests of applicants or other persons  according to Art. 9 (2) (c) GDPR or for health care or  occupational medicine purposes, for assessing the employee's  ability to work, for medical diagnostics, for care or treatment  in the health or social sector, or for the administration of  systems and services in the health or social sector in accordance  with Art. 9 (2) (h) GDPR. In the case of a notification of the  special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their  processing is based on Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR.
Duration of storage
Personal data is stored as long as processing is necessary  for the purposes described under "Categories of data" unless you  have expressly given us your consent for a longer storage period  (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR), or unless statutory provisions prescribe a  longer storage period (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR). As far as the data  subject to the statutory retention periods, we store this data in  our systems until the statutory retention periods have expired  (these are generally 6 or 10 years for reasons of proper  bookkeeping and tax law requirements).
We will inform you if we use the services of third-party  providers or platforms to provide our services, since the  relationship between you as a user of these services and the  respective providers will then be governed by their terms and  conditions and privacy policies (and thus possibly different  storage periods). It is the responsibility of the contractual  partner to secure their data when the storage period expires  (e.g. if the customer account is terminated).
With regard to email addresses provided by you to receive  newsletters, the following shall apply as well: We store deleted  email addresses for up to three years on the basis of our  legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to  prove a previously given consent (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). The  processing of this data is limited to the purpose of possible  defense against claims. An individual request for deletion may be  made at any time provided that the previous existence of consent  is confirmed at the same time. In the event of obligations to  take due account of objections, we reserve the right to store the  email address in a blacklist (so-called "blocklist") for this  purpose alone.
In addition, the following shall apply with regard to the  application process:
Unless the application has led to the commencement of  employment with us, the personal data collected via our job  portal or by other means for the purposes of the application  process will be further processed for a maximum of three years  after the process has been completed (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) for  evidence preservation purposes, after which they will be deleted  or anonymized. The application process itself is considered  completed no later than three months after receipt of your  application.
Upon termination of the contractual relationship with customer  data, all information relating to the user account will be  deleted, subject to a statutory retention period. It is the  responsibility of the users to back up their data before the end  of the contract. We are entitled to irretrievably delete all user data stored during the term of the contract.
Data recipients
We will only pass on your data to third parties in compliance  with the statutory provisions to the extent that this
a. is necessary for the purposes described under "Categories  of data",
b. is necessary to fulfill legal obligations, or
c. takes place with your consent as a data subject.
If the transfer or disclosure of the data takes place on our  behalf for the execution of data processing processes that are  earmarked for a specific purpose or subject to consent according  to (a) above, we will enter into suitable contracts or agreements  with the recipients of the data (processors) which serve to  protect your data (
Art.    28    GDPR
).
Recipients of this data can be:
Telecommunications companies
(Technical and organizational) auxiliary service    providers
Subcontractors
Banks
Tax and legal advisers
Web hosting providers
IT service providers
Providers of product review procedures
Payment service providers
Providers of online application tools
Providers of web analysis, online marketing or CRM    services
Providers of survey tools
Cloud services
Tax authorities
We may transfer personal data to affiliated companies of our  group of companies or grant them access to this data. If this  transfer takes place for administrative purposes, the transfer of  the data is based on our legitimate business and commercial  interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or takes place if it is necessary  to fulfill our contractual obligations (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR), or  if the consent of the data subject (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or legal  permission (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR) has been obtained.
Subject to your express consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or a  transfer required by contract (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR) or by law  (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR), your personal data will only be processed  in third countries (i.e. outside the European Union or the  European Economic Area) with a recognized level of data  protection, a contractual obligation through so-called standard  protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the presence of  certifications or binding internal data protection regulations,  by us or on our behalf (Art. 44 to 49 GDPR).
Please also refer to the information page of the EU  Commission:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de
).

Where personal data concerning you are processed for the      purpose of direct mail advertising, you have the right to      object at any time to the processing of personal data      concerning you for the purpose of such advertising; this also      applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such      direct mail advertising.

AnyDesk processes your data in accordance with the data  protection regulations of the German
Federal Data    Protection Act
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - "BDSG") in the  version valid as of May 25, 2018 and the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation  - "GDPR").
The relevant legal basis for the processing is stated in the  information on the individual categories of data.
Categories of data
AnyDesk processes different categories of personal data. In  the following sections, the data is presented according to the  group of data subjects, the respective purpose, and the relevant  legal basis.
Customers and business partners
Insofar as we are in a contractual, quasi-contractual or  pre-contractual business relationship with you, i.e. if you are  already a customer, business partner or are interested in such a  legal relationship ("contractual partner"), we process the  following data as necessary:
Personal data (e.g. names, addresses, gender, company, location)
Payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history)
Contract data (e.g. subject matter of the contract, type of license, term, customer category, customer ID, login    information)
Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content,    access times, time and duration of the respective remote data    connection (session), data volume transferred, online status of    the client)
Meta-/communication data (e.g. device information, device ID, IP and MAC addresses)
Content of communication directed at us (e.g. product or contract inquiries, error messages, responses to our    surveys)
We will inform you in a transparent manner before or during  data collection as to extent od data that is required for this  purpose. We process the data:
to be able to address you in communication,
to answer your questions,
to establish and fulfill our contractual obligations,
to protect our rights,
to protect against unauthorized use and misuse of our offers,
for related administrative tasks, and
for the purposes of business organization.
Your data is processed, in particular, to allow you to select,  acquire or order the selected products (licenses to use our  software and any associated services), as well as to enable  payment and processing. During the registration process required  to acquire a license, we will create an account for you on in our  systems ("customer account" or "user account"). During  registration, we will point out which of the above-mentioned  details are required for this purpose, in particular to verify  registration or the respective use of our login functions and the  use of the user account, and to prevent any possible misuse of  the customer account. The customer account (my.anydesk.com) gives  you access to your connection data, the contract/license  information, information about the AnyDesk clients that are  linked to the license, your master data as a customer, invoices,  and any settings for payment methods. AnyDesk customer accounts  are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. We may  use email or in-app messaging to inform users about processes  relevant to their user account (such as technical changes) or to  invite them to participate in surveys.
The legal basis for the processing is therefore:
For contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries -    Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR
With regard to legal obligation - Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR
Otherwise, with regard to our legitimate interests - Art. 6    (1) (f) GDPR
We do not store any content of the respective remote data  connection (session data) beyond the required scope of data  transfer. The customer can create a chat log or a session  recording, which is then only stored locally on the customer's  computer. AnyDesk does not access these session data.
Users of our website
Log files
When users visit our website, we (or our web hosting provider)  collect user access data (so-called server log files). The server  log files can include the following data:
The address and name of the websites and files accessed
Date and time of access
Data volumes transferred
Notification of successful access
Browser type and version
User's operating system
Referrer URL (the previously visited page)
IP address
This processing takes place to ensure problem-free connection  to and smooth use of our website, and to ensure system security  and stability. In particular, we do not use your data to draw  conclusions about your person. Information of this kind may be  statistically evaluated by us in order to optimize our website  and the technology behind it. This processing takes place in  accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR on the basis of our  legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality  of our website and preventing the misuse of our services.
Cookies
In addition, we use so-called cookies, i.e. text files that  are stored on a user's computer by a browser and contain  information about this user during or after his visit to a  website, which may be processed by us. This information includes,  for example, the login status, pages or media accessed,  pseudonymous online identification ("user" or "AnyDesk IDs"), the  content of a shopping cart, the licensed product selected, or the  user-specific settings on our websites.
Please note that there are different types of cookies with  different purposes:
First-party cookies are set by us.
Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers    (so-called third parties) to process user information.
Temporary cookies (also: session cookies) are deleted at the    latest after a user has left a website and closed his    browser.
Permanent cookies remain stored on the user's computer even    after the browser is closed. This allows, for example, saving the    login status or displaying the user-preferred content again    directly when the user visits the website later. User interests    used for audience measurement or marketing purposes may also be    stored in such a cookie.
Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies    are absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to    store logins or other user entries, or for security reasons).
Statistical, online marketing and personalization cookies,    on the other hand, are used to measure audience and to display    content to users that matches their potential interests according    to the stored data about access to certain content (so-called    tracking). If we use these types of cookies or tracking    technologies, we will inform you of this beforehand as part of    the process of obtaining your consent.
Depending on the type of cookies, we use them to process your  personal data either on the basis of a previously given consent  in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR, on the basis of our  legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (e.g.  to support the operation of our website and its improvement), or  because the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our  contractual obligations in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (b)  GDPR.
Before we process your data or have them processed in the  context of the use of cookies, when you access the page, we will  inform you about which cookies we use and will ask for your  consent, which can be revoked at any time (cookie opt-in tool or  banner). Before the consent is given, only cookies which are  absolutely necessary for the operation of our website may be  used.
In addition to the option of revoking your consent at any  time, you can also view our website without cookies. Please note  that Internet browsers are regularly set to accept cookies. In  general, you can disable the use of cookies at any time via your  browser settings. Please use the help functions of your Internet  browser to find out how you can change these settings (individual  functions of our website, such as registration and use of the  customer portal, may not work if you have disabled the use of  cookies). With regard to tracking, you can also object to the use  of cookies via a variety of services, e.g. via the websites
https://optout.aboutads.info
and
https://www.youronlinechoices.com/
(
"opt-out").
Registration and use of customer account
In the context of the registrations and use of the customer  accounts, we store the IP addresses of the customers together  with the access times in order to be able to verify the  registration and to prevent possible misuse of the customer  account. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1)  (f) GDPR.
Contact forms
When you visit the AnyDesk website, you can use a form to  contact us, in particular to request technical support. In  addition to the technical details listed in there, you must  provide your first and last name, email address, customer ID, the  text and the factual context of the inquiry. The personal data  transferred to us in this context will only be used to process  the respective inquiries. The legal basis for the data processing  is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
Surveys
We rely on the voluntary feedback from our customers and  website users in order to continuously improve our services and  products. For this reason, we also use technical services and  form functions of third-party providers, which we integrate into  our website, in order to establish contact and to design specific  surveys. In doing so, we collect the requested data, which you  enter in the form, as well as meta and communication data (e.g.  IP address), which we can assign to your customer and contract  data.
The legal basis for the use of these functions is our  legitimate interest in the target group-oriented and flexibly  adaptable presentation of contact forms on specific topics in  order to be able to efficiently analyze the review of our  services by our customers and to improve these services (Art. 6  (1) (f) GDPR). With regard to the collection of your voluntary  provided information when using these survey functions, the legal  basis is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.  Participating in the surveys is purely voluntary and is not  required for our performance of the contract.
Newsletters (email marketing)
You have the option of subscribing to a newsletter, i.e.  receiving emails from us, via our website. The specific content  of the newsletter is based on the description provided during  subscription (e.g. special offers, products and events);  otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services  and our company.
In order to subscribe, you just need to provide your email  address. It will only be used to send you the newsletter you have  subscribed to by email. After subscribing, you will receive an  email to this email address, in which you will be asked to  confirm your subscription in order to prevent someone from  subscribing with a different email address ("double-opt-in  procedure"). We record all newsletter subscriptions in order to  prove the legal conformity of the subscription process. This  includes storing the time of registration and confirmation as  well as the IP address.
Newsletters are sent on the basis of the recipient's consent,  which can be withdrawn at any time (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR), or, if  such consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate  interests in direct marketing (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR), if and to  the extent that this is permitted by law (e.g. in the case of  advertising to existing customers). The subscription process is  recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose  of proving that it has been conducted properly (Art. 6 (1) (f)  GDPR). If we commission a service provider to send emails, this  is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient  and secure mailing system (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
Please note:
The newsletters may contain a so-called  web beacon (also called tracking pixel), i.e. a pixel-sized file  that is retrieved from our server or from the server of a mailing  service provider commissioned by us when the newsletter is  opened. As part of this retrieval, we collect technical  information, such as information about the browser and your  system, as well as your IP address and the time of retrieval.
On the one hand, this information is used to improve our  newsletters on the basis of the technical data or to determine  target groups and their reading behavior on the basis of their  retrieval locations (which can be determined using the IP  address) or access times.
On the other hand, this analysis includes determining whether  or not the newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and  which links are clicked on. For technical reasons, this  information can be assigned to the individual email addresses of  the newsletter recipients. However, neither we nor the mailing  service provider commissioned by us will make such an assignment;  the data is evaluated exclusively to adapt our contents to the  reading habits of our users. This evaluation takes place, subject  to the express consent of the user to receive the newsletter, on  the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of using a  user-friendly and secure newsletter system which both serves our  business interests and meets the expectations of the users (Art.  6 (1) (f) GDPR).
You can unsubscribe from our newsletters at any time, i.e.  revoke your consent or object to further receipt of newsletters.  A link to unsubscribe from our newsletters can also be found at  the end of each newsletter.
Plugins, embedded functions and content
We integrate various functions and content from third-party  providers (e.g. graphics, videos or social media buttons and  posts) in our website in order to make relevant information about  our company and our services easily accessible to you as a user  of our website. For this purpose, the third-party providers  process the IP addresses of the users, since without the IP  address they would not be able to send the content to their  browsers.
Social media buttons
When you click on one of our social media buttons, the data is  transferred to the corresponding social network via the so-called  "Shariff" application. Instead of your browser, a connection with  the server of the respective social network platform is  established by the server on which our website is located, i.e.  initially no personal data of the user is passed on to the social  network provider. A "Shariff" button establishes direct contact  between the social network and you as a user only when you  actively click on the "Share" button. You can recognize the  respective provider of the plugin by the marking on the box or in  the circle above its respective first letter or the logo. More  information about the "Shariff project" can be obtained from the  developers of the ct magazine:
https://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html
.
Pixel tags
In addition, third-party providers may use so-called pixel  tags (also known as web beacons) in order to evaluate visitor  flows. This exclusively pseudonymous information may also be  stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain technical  information about the browser and operating system, websites to  be referred to, the time of visit, and other details on the use  of our website, and may also be linked to such information from  other sources. With regard to the legal basis and the individual  opt-out options, please refer to the information on the use of  cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Video integration
We integrate videos from the YouTube platform on our website,  in particular via a plugin, in order to provide you with visually  rich information about our products and technical processes. In  doing so, we use the YouTube "No Cookies" function, i.e. we have  enabled the "
privacy-enhanced"
function. Therefore,  videos are accessed via
youtube-nocookie.com
instead of
youtube.com
. When the relevant pages are accessed,  however, the IP address and other data mentioned under "Log  files" are transferred and thus, in particular, information is  provided as to which of our Internet pages you have visited.  However, this information cannot be associated with you if you  are permanently signed in to YouTube or another Google service  when you access the page. When you start playing such an  integrated video by clicking on it, the YouTube privacy-enhanced  mode on your device only stores cookies that do not contain any  personally identifiable information, unless you are currently  signed in to a Google service. These cookies can be blocked via  certain browser settings and extensions. With regard to the legal  basis, please also refer to the information on the use of cookies  in this Privacy Policy.
Interactive maps
Furthermore, we integrate Google Maps on our website in order  to include an interactive map directly on the website to  determine our company location and to allow you to conveniently  use the map function for better navigation. In certain versions,  the integration means that when the user accesses the website,  Google may set cookies with which a connection to the Google  network is established. The legal basis for the integration of  Google Maps and the associated data transfer to Google is your  consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Please refer to the information on  the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
eRecruiting
We also integrate a plugin for the "Prescreen" eRecruiting  system on our website. This allows us to place job advertisements  under the ".jobbase.io" domain and receive and manage  applications. Cookies may be used on our website to record users  of application forms. The legal basis for this is your consent  (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Please refer to the information on the use  of cookies in this Privacy Policy. When you go to our application  page under
https://anydesk.com/en/career/jobs
and  click the "Apply Now" button, the IP address as well as the  information listed under "Log files" will be transferred to the  server of the third-party provider and you will be forwarded to  our current job offers on their server. The legal basis for this  is § 26 BDSG in conjunction with Art. 88 GDPR, as well as (for  the implementation of pre-contractual measures) Art. 6 (1) (b)  GDPR. For more information, please refer to "Job offers and  application process".
Protection of the website
We use the "Wordfence Security" service to protect our website  from viruses and malware and to fend off attacks by computer  criminals. IP addresses are stored on the third-party servers, in  particular, to protect against so-called brute-force and DDoS  attacks. IP addresses classified as harmless are placed on a  white list. The protection of our website and its users  constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6  (1) (f) GDPR. In addition, the plugin uses cookies to recognize  whether the visitor of our website is a human or a robot. In this  respect, please refer to the information on the use of cookies in  this Privacy Policy. The Live Traffic View option of the plugin  is disabled as it is not mandatory.
Multilingual design
We also use the multilingual WPML plugin in order to offer you  our website in different languages. The design of our website  that is comprehensible for as many users as possible constitutes  a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.  For this purpose, when you visit our website, WPML sets a cookie  in order to store the language setting you have selected. In this  respect, please refer to the information on the use of cookies in  this Privacy Policy.
SEO
We use the YOAST SEO plugin to support the search engine  optimization of our website. This plugin ensures the technical  optimization of our website for search engines while supporting  us in the development of content on our website. This is done to  make sure that customer groups interested in our offers can  easier find us on the Internet, which is a legitimate interest  within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The plugin uses  cookies. In this respect, please refer to the information on the  use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Web analysis
For the evaluation of visitor flows on our website, we may  record the behavior, interests or demographic information of the  users of our website as pseudonymous values. Based on this  audience analysis, we can, for example, identify under which IP  address, at what time and from where certain contents of our  website or its functions are most frequently accessed, or invite  the user to use them again. This also allows us to better  understand which functions or content of our website require  optimization (because they are not accessed as often or not at  all). For this purpose, we create and store user profiles in a  file (a so-called cookie), or we may use similar procedures with  the same purpose.
On the one hand, to protect the users, we use a so-called IP  masking procedure (pseudonymization by shortening the IP address)  when storing the users' IP addresses. On the other hand, in the  context of web analysis and optimization, no real user ID data is  stored (i.e. neither email addresses nor names), but strictly  pseudonyms. Therefore, we do not know the actual identity of the  users. We use the stored data exclusively for the aforementioned  purposes in their pseudonymous user profiles. With regard to the  legal basis and the individual opt-out options, please refer to  the information on the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Online marketing
User profiles can be created and stored in a file (cookie) to  display advertising content or to market advertising space  (online marketing). These data can be used to determine the  users' potential interests and to measure the effectiveness of  online marketing. The stored data may include content accessed,  websites visited, online networks used, as well as communication  partners and technical information, such as the IP address, the  browser used, the computer system used, and information on usage  times. If users have consented to their location data being  collected, this data may also be processed.
The following shall also apply in the case of online  marketing: We use a so-called IP masking procedure  (pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) when storing IP  addresses. In the context of web analysis and optimization, no  real user ID data is stored (i.e. neither email addresses nor  names), but strictly pseudonyms.
Therefore, we do not know the actual identity of the users. We  use these stored data exclusively for the aforementioned purposes  in their pseudonymous user profiles. In exceptional cases, real  ID data may be assigned to the user profiles if the respective  user is a member of a social network whose online marketing  process we use and with whose providers the users have entered  into agreements (e.g. by giving consent during registration),  according to which the network may link the user profiles with  the aforementioned data.
Otherwise, we only have access to summarized information about  the success of our advertisements, i.e. we can measure which of  our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion  (i.e. to an inquiry or a contract with us).
In general, the data stored in the cookies (or using  comparable processes) may also be read on other websites (which  use the same online marketing process) and, in turn, may be  analyzed for the purpose of displaying content, supplemented with  further data if necessary, and stored on the server of the online  marketing process provider.
With regard to the legal basis for online marketing processes  and the individual opt-out options, please refer to the  information on the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Review procedures and widgets
We use the so-called review widgets on the AnyDesk website to  allow our customers to review providers and products, and for our  own quality management. In the process, a reference to the  results of the review of our products by customers offered by a  service provider named in there is integrated via a linked page  or image element. When the image element is called up, the  service provider's web server automatically saves the IP address  and the information listed under "Log files". Further personal  data may be transferred to the respective service provider if you  have decided to review our products according to their terms and  conditions.
This data processing takes place on the basis of Art. 6 (1)  (f) GDPR and is necessary to safeguard our legitimate interest in  transparent review management and to ensure that we only publish  reviews by users who can actually report on their own experiences  as our customers and users of our products.
Customer Relationship Management
We use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to  maintain our customer relationships as part of our online  presence. They help us to effectively systematize, manage and  document product-relevant information offers and communication  with our customers. This is done using software solutions which  integrate the following aspects when using our website:
Contact management
Email marketing
Social media publishing
Web analysis
Online marketing
Registration services (our user account my.anydesk.com)
Customer review management
With regard to the legal basis and the individual opt-out  options, please refer to the information on the aforementioned  topics and the services used in this Privacy Policy.
In the case that you are already a registered customer of  AnyDesk, the Web Analysis and Online Marketing services may  contain specific information about your customer, contact and  contract information that shall be linked with your account. The  legal basis for the use of this personal data is our legitimate  interests in improving our website to make it easier for the  customers to use it and to provide additional information and  offers pertaining to our services (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
Content Delivery Network
In order to deliver the content of our website, i.e. also large  media files (such as graphics, videos or program scripts) to you  faster and more securely, we use regionally distributed servers  of a so-called Content Delivery Network (CDN), which are  connected via the Internet. In doing so, we establish a  connection to the server of the CDN service provider and transfer  your IP address there. If you are signed in with an existing user  account with this service provider while visiting our website,  this service provider can also associate your visit to our  website with your user behavior. The legal basis for the use of a  CDN and the associated data transfer are our legitimate interests  in improving our website to make it easier for the customers to  use it (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
In addition, the service provider can send further cookies to  your browser. In this respect, please refer to the information on  the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.

Parts of these data are also processed in order to analyze  whether and on which connection path your device is available for  connection to other devices.
When the remote data connection takes place between the  connection partners, the session data are transferred to the  software client of the other connection partner via our master  server and (taking into account, in particular, the locations and  the current load) certain routing servers. AnyDesk itself does  not access these session data. We store the following usage data  for the purposes also mentioned in here (existing data will be  overwritten):

We may also contact you via in-app messages, in compliance  with the legal requirements, if the communication is necessary  for the purposes of administration or use of the application, or  to inform you about changes or improvements to our products or  completely new products, to invite you to participate in surveys,  or to give you tips on how to get the most out of our products.  For this purpose, we will process the above-mentioned usage data  as well as
your customer ID
. In the course of  deciding whether and how we should contact and inform you, we  will also process the type of license you have, the language and  version of the product you are using and/or your country, and we  may also use data that we have collected through web  analysis.
The data processing necessary for the verification of the  usage authorization and the provision of the functionalities of  the application itself serves to fulfill contractual obligations  (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR). In addition, we process data if this is  required to secure the application or protect our legitimate  business interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR; e.g. collection of data  for the purpose of optimizing the application, or for security  purposes). Otherwise, data will only be processed to the extent  to which you as the user have expressly given your consent (Art.  6 (1) (a) GDPR).
Please note that the opt-out or revocation of the respective  authorizations may affect the functionality of our  application.
Google Speech-to-Text
In our app you will find the Google Speech-to-Text function. This is operated by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereinafter "Google").
This function is used to compose voice messages and send them to the Google Cloud for conversion into character strings.
The Google Speech-to-Text function is provided as an option.
Data is therefore only transmitted to Google when you press the microphone icon. This activates the microphone you are using and you now have the option of converting the spoken language into text.
Purpose
The purpose is to enable a more comfortable and user-friendly use of our app.
By converting the spoken words and sentences into text through Google Speech-to-Text, the processes are accelerated and simplified.
Legal basis
The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) f) DSGVO.
Our legitimate interest is to improve the functionality and usability of our app.
Recipients of the data
If you activate the microphone icon and make a voice input, Google receives the spoken sentence in order to convert it into text.
Google does not make the audio sent to the Speech-to-Text API available to anyone except as necessary to provide the Speech-to-Text API service. For example, it may be necessary to engage a third-party provider to provide some aspects of Google's services, such as data storage or transmission. In these cases, that provider is subject to contractual obligations of security and confidentiality. Google does not share your audio content with other parties for any other purpose.
Storage period
AnyDesk does not store your data as part of the Speech-to-Text function. Your data is passed directly to Google for conversion.
By default, Google does not log a customer's audio data or transcripts.
Google uses customer data to optimise and improve the speech recognition service, only if you sign up for the data logging program.
AnyDesk has chosen not to enroll in the data logging program in order to protect your personal data.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Google may retain audio files.
Provision mandatory or required
The provision of your personal data is voluntary and is not required by law or contract. However, without the data transfer to Google-Speech-to-Text, a conversion of your spoken language into text is not possible.
Objection
Please read the information about your right to object according to Art. 21 DSGVO below.
You can find more detailed information about data processing by Google in the Google Privacy Notice:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
and more detailed information about the Google Speech-to-Text function here:
https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text?hl=en
Telemetry-Data
Nature and purpose of processing
We collect and aggregate user telemetry data in connection with the provision of our services for the following purposes:
Evaluating interactions:
From the analysis on the use of the program interface and functions, insights can be gained into the acceptance of AnyDesk's graphical components and functionalities, so that areas with potential for optimization can be better identified in the context of further product development and the user experience can be improved.
Licenses and scamming
When using the free version of AnyDesk, usage data is reviewed to determine whether the user's behaviour patterns are in accordance with our “AnyDesk Free” Supplementary Terms and Conditions, see the section entitled "Automatic Decision Making (License Audit)".
Usage data is analysed to detect potential scamming cases at an early stage.
Evaluation of system data
Which hardware is used when AnyDesk software is in use provides us with important information for support purposes, for example, in the event of client-side performance problems. In addition, this information is used for further product development with regard to system modifications.
Type of data
Version of client, client ID, IP address, operating system, zone of relay (continent, later country), license, license name, network ID, first login, last login, user_identifier (user) hashed, information about interactions: Timestamp of interaction, message counter,
Category of interaction: click, drag, drop, etc.
Identifier for interaction: login, frontend, click events, undraggable, auto-update, etc., which window e.g. settings or window for file transfer (within the software).
Legal basis
The processing of telemetry data is based on the user's consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.
Storage period
The data will only be processed as long as your consent is given or for 2 years.
Provision mandatory or required
This consent is voluntary. If it is not given, you will not have any disadvantages. This consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
Revocation of consent
The revocation of consent is possible at any time with effect for the future and can be done by using the deactivation button.
Automated decision making
see paragraph -
"Automated decision making (license audit)"
.
Automatic decision making (license audit)
We offer personal users of our licensed products (i.e.  exclusively for uses that cannot be attributed to commercial or  self-employed professional activity) the option of a free  version, which can be used without setting up a user account  after simply downloading the application. In this case, we may  analyze your usage data (see above under "Applications") in line  with our "AnyDesk Free" Supplementary Terms and Conditions in  order to be able to assess whether your behavior pattern aligns  with the contractual purpose of use and thus to the selected  license type (license audit).
If, based on the results of this analysis, a fee-based license  is required, we reserve the right to restrict or even block your  access to our server services and we will ask you to purchase a  fee-based license. This takes place in an automated  decision-making process according to our system settings. You can  contact our Support at any time to ask us to reassess your user  behavior. We will inform you beforehand which information you  will need to provide.
The automated decision-making process as part of the license  audit and the use of automated mechanisms based on it (such as  the restriction or blocking of non-contractual uses) is essential  for the effective control of compliance and, if necessary, the  enforcement of our license terms with regard to the considerable  number of users of the free version of our application. Since the  use of the free version can only be financed through paid usage  relationships, this automated decision-making process is  necessary to fulfill our contractual services for private users,  as it must be effectively ensured that all users use our  application within the contractually agreed license scope. The  legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR in conjunction with  Art. 22 (2) (a) GDPR.
Social networks
Our company maintains an online presence within various social  networks (social media). We process data of active users of these  social networks in order to communicate with them there or to  offer information about AnyDesk. This processing takes place on  the basis of our legitimate interests in effective information  for users and communication with users under the applicable  framework conditions of the respective social medium in  accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. If you, as a user of the  respective social medium, are asked to give your consent to data  processing (e.g. by ticking a check box), the legal basis for  processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.
If it is technically possible for us to influence the  processing operations relevant to the data protection regulations  of the respective social media you have accessed, we will do so  in the sense of data minimization within the meaning of Art. 5  (1) (c) GDPR. However, please note that your use of the  respective social networks is subject to their terms and  conditions and data processing guidelines. Therefore, it cannot  be ruled out that your data may also be processed outside the  European Union. On the one hand, this could make it more  difficult to enforce your rights. On the other hand, the data  collected when using the functionalities of the social networks  may also be analyzed and processed for market research and  advertising purposes. This is done by storing your usage behavior  and the resulting interests and preferences as usage profiles in  cookies and by placing advertisements based on these profiles  inside and outside the social networks that presumably match your  interests (online marketing). If you as a user are also a member  of the respective social networks and are signed in to them, the  usage profiles may also store data that are independent of those  of the end devices you are using.
Information and notes on the respective forms of processing  and the opt-out options can be found in the privacy policies and  details of the operators of the respective networks. Since only  the respective operators of the social networks have access to  the data processed by them, you would also need to make requests  for information in this regard and assert your rights as a data  subject with them. We will be more than happy to help you if you  need our support in this regard.

Job offers and application process
As part of our application process, it is necessary for  applicants to provide us with the data required for their  professional assessment and selection. Which data this is in the  individual case can be seen from the respective job advertisement  or from the information provided in the relevant online forms.  When you apply for a job offer, we usually process the following  categories of personal data:
Contact information:
First and last name (title, if applicable)
Address
Phone number
Email address
Qualification-related information, in particular:
Academic achievements and other information contained in the    curriculum vitae, including information on prices and    scholarships and extracurricular achievements, information on    dissertation projects, information on education and professional    experience
Copies of diplomas and certificates
Photos attached to an application, if applicable
Information on (possibly only planned or hoped for) further    education and other career steps as well as professional focuses    and interests, if applicable
We collect these data directly from you and only process them  to the extent necessary for the application process. The legal  basis for this processing is § 26 BDSG in conjunction with Art.  88 GDPR, as well as (for the implementation of pre-contractual  measures with regard to freelancers) Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. The  data will be encrypted and transferred to us in accordance with  the latest state of the art. Please note that we may use  third-party services for the purpose of searching for and  selecting applicants (e.g. applicant management or recruitment  software and platforms). The legal basis for this is our  legitimate interest in an efficient and transparent job  advertisement (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR; please also refer to the  information in "Data recipients").
During the application process, special categories of personal  data within the meaning of Art. 9 (1) GDPR (e.g. health data,  such as severe impairment or ethnic origin) are processed only  for the purpose of exercising the obligations or rights arising  to us or the data subject from labor law and social security and  social protection law (Art. 9 (2) (b) GDPR), and otherwise to  protect the vital interests of applicants or other persons  according to Art. 9 (2) (c) GDPR or for health care or  occupational medicine purposes, for assessing the employee's  ability to work, for medical diagnostics, for care or treatment  in the health or social sector, or for the administration of  systems and services in the health or social sector in accordance  with Art. 9 (2) (h) GDPR. In the case of a notification of the  special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their  processing is based on Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR.
Duration of storage
Personal data is stored as long as processing is necessary  for the purposes described under "Categories of data" unless you  have expressly given us your consent for a longer storage period  (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR), or unless statutory provisions prescribe a  longer storage period (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR). As far as the data  subject to the statutory retention periods, we store this data in  our systems until the statutory retention periods have expired  (these are generally 6 or 10 years for reasons of proper  bookkeeping and tax law requirements).
We will inform you if we use the services of third-party  providers or platforms to provide our services, since the  relationship between you as a user of these services and the  respective providers will then be governed by their terms and  conditions and privacy policies (and thus possibly different  storage periods). It is the responsibility of the contractual  partner to secure their data when the storage period expires  (e.g. if the customer account is terminated).
With regard to email addresses provided by you to receive  newsletters, the following shall apply as well: We store deleted  email addresses for up to three years on the basis of our  legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to  prove a previously given consent (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). The  processing of this data is limited to the purpose of possible  defense against claims. An individual request for deletion may be  made at any time provided that the previous existence of consent  is confirmed at the same time. In the event of obligations to  take due account of objections, we reserve the right to store the  email address in a blacklist (so-called "blocklist") for this  purpose alone.
In addition, the following shall apply with regard to the  application process:
Unless the application has led to the commencement of  employment with us, the personal data collected via our job  portal or by other means for the purposes of the application  process will be further processed for a maximum of three years  after the process has been completed (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) for  evidence preservation purposes, after which they will be deleted  or anonymized. The application process itself is considered  completed no later than three months after receipt of your  application.
Upon termination of the contractual relationship with customer  data, all information relating to the user account will be  deleted, subject to a statutory retention period. It is the  responsibility of the users to back up their data before the end  of the contract. We are entitled to irretrievably delete all user data stored during the term of the contract.
Data recipients
We will only pass on your data to third parties in compliance  with the statutory provisions to the extent that this
a. is necessary for the purposes described under "Categories  of data",
b. is necessary to fulfill legal obligations, or
c. takes place with your consent as a data subject.
If the transfer or disclosure of the data takes place on our  behalf for the execution of data processing processes that are  earmarked for a specific purpose or subject to consent according  to (a) above, we will enter into suitable contracts or agreements  with the recipients of the data (processors) which serve to  protect your data (
Art.    28    GDPR
).
Recipients of this data can be:
Telecommunications companies
(Technical and organizational) auxiliary service    providers
Subcontractors
Banks
Tax and legal advisers
Web hosting providers
IT service providers
Providers of product review procedures
Payment service providers
Providers of online application tools
Providers of web analysis, online marketing or CRM    services
Providers of survey tools
Cloud services
Tax authorities
We may transfer personal data to affiliated companies of our  group of companies or grant them access to this data. If this  transfer takes place for administrative purposes, the transfer of  the data is based on our legitimate business and commercial  interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or takes place if it is necessary  to fulfill our contractual obligations (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR), or  if the consent of the data subject (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or legal  permission (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR) has been obtained.
Subject to your express consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or a  transfer required by contract (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR) or by law  (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR), your personal data will only be processed  in third countries (i.e. outside the European Union or the  European Economic Area) with a recognized level of data  protection, a contractual obligation through so-called standard  protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the presence of  certifications or binding internal data protection regulations,  by us or on our behalf (Art. 44 to 49 GDPR).
Please also refer to the information page of the EU  Commission:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de
).

WHO WE ARE
Albacross Nordic AB (hereinafter “
Albacross
”, “
we
”, “
us
”, or “
our
”) is a business intelligence company who is a business intelligence company providing tools and services to help businesses (“Customers,” “Users,” or “you”) optimize marketing and sales efforts. Our platform leverages data analytics and AI-driven technologies to help identify potential prospects, monitor buying intent, and analyze trends across various industries. These insights support more targeted audience segmentation and engagement strategies. Albacross’ services, as described on our website, are collectively referred to as the “Services.”
We offer our Services as processors to our customers, but as we improve our Services, we process personal data as controllers. This, and our other activities as controllers, are described in this Privacy Policy.
We process personal data under this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679/EU (the “
GDPR
”) and other applicable national data protection laws in Sweden. Our objective is to maintain a high level of protection for personal privacy. All terms used in this Privacy Policy that are not otherwise defined herein should be understood and interpreted in accordance with the GDPR.
1. WHY AND HOW DO WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA
ALBACROSS’ SERVICES
When we offer our Services, our customers are data controllers and responsible for any personal data processing involved in the provision of these Services. We process personal data on the customer’s behalf and upon their instructions. Please, see our customer’s own privacy policies regarding the personal data processed by our customers.
As we continuously improve the functionality of our Services, we are the controller for the processing of personal data in relation to the improvement of our Services.
The data processed
is the IP-address from which you visited our customer´s website, and technical information that enables us to tell different visitors apart that are originating from the same IP-address (cookies). In some cases, the IP-address and the company it is matched with may constitute personal data – for instance when it comes to sole traders – as it would allow for the identification of the visitor. Your contact and account details, along with technical data regarding your account, if applicable.
Our purpose
for processing Personal Data is that it enables us to improve our Services by adding data to our database, to help with Services and customer support you request, troubleshoot problems, and at times resolve disputes and collect fees.
The legal ground
for this is to pursue our legitimate interest to improve our Services. You may at any time contact us for more information regarding this legal ground and the balancing of interest that we have done.
PROVIDING THE SERVICE, AND THERETO CONNECTED FUNCTIONS
Google user data
Albacross provides the ability to integrate with your Gmail account to let our Service help you send e-mails via the Gmail API.
To provide the automated service of sending, processing and monitoring messages created by the user and approved to be sent through Albacross’s service, we need to read, compose, and modify Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings.
To minimize the amount of Personal Data collected and to request the API scope(s) as narrow as possible, but still to provide accurate functioning and statistics from the Service, we will only read specific parts of an incoming email by singling out key words suitable to administrate, identify and query the messages assignable to our Service. We do not read the entire content of any specific message unless expressly agreed to by the Client. Reasons for such approval would be for necessary security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law or for quality improvements in internal operations. Operations for quality improvements will be set forth only when the data is aggregated and anonymized.
The only information we store is your e-mail address of the Gmail account connected to the Service, the authentication tokens, and identifiers for messages and conversations sent through the Service. We only use this information to provide the following services:
Creating and sending e-mail through Albacross’s services on behalf of the Client
Tracking of replies to messages sent through our services
We do not store incoming e-mails from your Gmail account. We will not use Gmail data for serving our own or any third-party advertisements. Any of your Gmail data collected or processed by us will not be shared with any third parties other than stated in section 4. You can always revoke Albacross’s access to your Gmail account by contacting us at support@albacross.com or here. If you decide to do so, Albacross will lose access to your Gmail account and will no longer be able to provide you campaign sending services through the Gmail API. We delete all data collected from your Gmail account upon request. Google Workspace APIs are not used to develop, improve, or train generalized AI and/or ML models. The following scopes are used with our Service:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.metadata
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly (optional opt-in by Customer)
Outlook user data
Albacross integrates with Outlook (Office 365 and Microsoft Exchange) similarly as to how Albacross integrates with Gmail, but by connecting with the Microsoft Graph API instead of the Gmail API. It is optional for the user to opt-in to the Outlook integration and Microsoft Graph API. The scopes used with the Microsoft Graph API are the following:
email, offline_access, openid, profile
User.Read
Mail.ReadWrite
Mail.Send
LinkedIn user data
Installing the Albacross Chrome Extension allows Albacross to receive access to your session cookie to perform actions on linkedin.com such as profile visits, connection requests and messaging access on LinkedIn.
WEBSITE
When you are visiting our Website, we gather non-personal data such as browser version, operating system version, IP-address (if there is not a match with a company IP-address, it is deleted), cookie information, time stamps (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page), and clickstream information (for example, which pages have been viewed and for how long). Albacross automatically receives and records such information on our server logs from your browser. We use this information to verify information and to enhance and optimize personalized offers to our customers and users.
CONTACT VIA THE WEBSITE
In certain sections of our Website, Albacross may invite you to contact us to pose questions, request information, or complete a registration form. We may ask you to supply Personal Data in order to register before allowing you access certain parts of our Website. We may also collect Personal Data when you use certain Services, through the use of our Website, or when you enter promotions or contests offered by Albacross.
The personal data processed
is your work email, first and last name, company, and role. Also, the email address to guests you invite to demonstrations are processed.
Our purpose
with processing the personal data is to provide you with services you have requested, such as e-book downloads, scheduling demonstrations of our services, setting up trial accounts, or subscriptions to our knowledge resources.
The legal ground
for our processing of personal data as per the above purpose is to either fulfill a contract with you (e.g. to provide you with an e-book) or to take steps at your request to enter into a contract (e.g. when you request a trial account).
The personal data collected via the Website may also be processed as described below, under marketing.
MARKETING
We do not sell nor rent the personal information from use of our Website to third parties for their marketing purposes. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies (such as demographic data) to improve and personalize the services provided to you.
Furthermore, in addition to using the information provided directly to us via our Website, we may collect Lead Contact Data (as defined below) regarding representatives of companies which have visited our Website, in order to contact such representatives to introduce Albacross and our services. If we have collected professional contact details about you, we may notify you of this when we contact you.
The personal data processed
is the name, employer, title/position, professional email address and job telephone number, of individuals employed by prospective customers (“
Lead Contact Data
”).
Our Purpose
for processing Lead Contact Data is to contact representatives of companies which Albacross deems as potential customers to Albacross, to inform them of Albacross’ services and offer trials, demonstrations, discounts, and similar.
The legal ground
for this is Albacross’ legitimate interest to market its services and gain new customers.
Our assessment is that the processing of Lead Contact Data for the purposes and legitimate interests above can be exercised without being overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of our website visitors. Please contact us if you would like to know more about our assessment.
OUR RIGHTS
We may also process personal data as required to help detect and prevent prohibited or illegal acts, respond to legal matters or requests from authorities, enforce our policies or to protect individual rights, property, or safety. Such processing is based on our legitimate interest to safeguard our company, or if applicable, our obligation to comply with mandatory laws. We may also process personal data when it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
2. RETENTION
We will process and store your personal data as long as necessary in relation to the purposes for which the information was collected. The personal data will be processed and stored as follows:
The Lead Contact Data is used to contact the representative as soon as possible (in no case longer than five (5) business days after obtaining the Lead Contact Data pertaining to the representative), upon which the representative is notified of the processing. If the representative is not interested in Albacross’ services, the Lead Contact Data is deleted. If the representative does not respond, the Lead Contact Data is deleted within thirty (30) days of its collection.
Other contact details used to manage a customer relationship will be deleted upon customer’s request after the customer’s subscription to our Services has ended. Albacross may be required to some information in order to comply with applicable laws, such as but not limited to laws on bookkeeping.
Our database is regularly checked for data relating to sole proprietors and similar actors which can be identified with the data in the database. If such data is found, it is deleted as it is encountered.
In case of disputes or matters with courts or authorities, we will store the data for the duration of the matter at hand, and then for a period of ten years after that.
3. COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS
We employ cookies on our Website in order for our server to recognize a returning visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files that your browser stores on your hard disk that allow us to remember you; cookies cannot access, read, or modify any other data on a computer. The cookies we place are readable only by us. All web browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie. If you refuse Albacross cookies, you may need to re-enter certain information each time you visit our Website and we may not be able to customize our Website’s features according to your preferences. You may also delete cookies manually from your hard drive.
The cookies we place contain identifiers that may be linked to certain non-personal data described in this Privacy Policy, as well as certain non-personal data advertising IDs from third parties.
We also use the Tracking Script on our Website, which utilizes cookies and web beacons, such as invisible tracking pixels, to help us better serve you and to provide targeted advertising we place on third party.
We store personal data regarding cookies for twenty-four (24) months.
4. OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
Albacross transfers the Personal Data to its systems for managing sales processes, which are provided by third parties processing personal data on behalf of Albacross. Such services providers may be based outside of the EU or EEA in countries which does not provide the same level of protection for personal data as provided by the GDPR. In such cases, the transfer of personal data is subject to appropriate safeguards as set out in the GDPR.
We may also disclose your information:
as required to respond to legal matters, enforce our policies or protect individual rights, property, or safety;
to employees and agents of Albacross in order to help detect and prevent prohibited or illegal acts;
to service providers under contract who help with our business operations;
to other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information;
to those serving apparently valid subpoenas; and
to other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by, that business entity.
Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information except when we believe in good faith, that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
5. SECURITY
Your information is stored on servers located in Ireland. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use certain tools (including, but not limited to, encryption, passwords and physical security) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we take reasonable steps to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
ACCOUNT PROTECTION
Your password is the key to your account. We recommend the use of unique numbers, letters, and special characters in combination and that you do not disclose your Albacross password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password.
For increased security, we recommend that you activate two factor authentication in your Account Settings.
PHISHING
In order to protect yourself from third parties unlawfully seeking your personal information through email that appears to be from Albacross, you should never provide any personal information directly in response to an email you believe you have received from us. Rather, you should always close any such email, open your browser, log directly into the Albacross Website and change, update, or modify any such personal information only using our Website. In the event that you believe that you have received a request for personal information in an email message that is made to appear that it was sent by us, please inform us immediately at
support@albacross.com
.
6. YOUR RIGHTS
Your rights according to the GDPR are the right to information about the processing; the right to access personal data relating to you; the right to have such data rectified, erased or restricted from processing; the right to object to our processing of personal data; as well as the right to not be subject to automatic decisions and the right to data portability. To exercise your rights, please contact us via support@albacross.com and provide us with your IP-address and company name.

Your rights
Our partners
CCPA Privacy Policy
Welcome! This is where you can learn about Criteo, the technologies and services we offer to our partners, and our data collection and privacy policies.
Disable Criteo services
Our activity
Criteo helps brands, e-commerce sites and other advertisers (“Advertisers”) promote their products and services. We do that by enabling Advertisers to tailor their campaigns and/or offers to audiences that they want to reach with content that they wish to promote, which in turns means that you may receive advertising that may be of interest to you on the websites, mobile applications and other platforms of our partners (the “Publishers” or “Partners”).
How do our services work?
Criteo does not use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc.
When you browse an Advertiser’s website or mobile application that uses our technologies, that technology allows us to collect a limited amount of data relating to your browsing, such as the products you have viewed, put in your shopping cart and purchased.
Find out more about the type of data collected by Criteo
. This navigation data is linked to a unique identifier, namely an identification cookie or any other similar technology (such as mobile advertising identifiers and non-cookie technologies) depending on your navigation environment.
When you browse a Publisher’s website or mobile application that also uses our technologies, the Publisher notifies us, either directly or through an advertiser exchange, that an advertising space is available to offer you personalized advertising. The Criteo technology, working with our Advertisers, then may decide to purchase that advertising space.
The advertising you see from our partners when using our technology is based on our recommendation algorithms.
Practical example
Here is one way our technology allows us to provide you with ads that may be of interest to you:
When users visit an Advertiser website using our technologies, data relating to their browsing events are collected.
Example of data collected by Criteo:
The user with the cookie identifier 123f94d8-a745-4f8b-a1d0-bf6fbbd60058 (let’s name it “Criteo ID 123” for convenience) viewed product A on 01/01/2018 at 13:37 while browsing www.example-advertiser.com.
Our technologies compare these data with the aggregated data available on the Advertiser’s website.
Example of aggregated data available:
In general, users who purchased Product A on www.example-advertiser.com also purchased Product B on this website
In general, Product C is popular on this website
When users browse a Publisher website, we are informed of the availability of advertising spaces.
Example of data collected by Criteo:
An advertising space with the following characteristics (size, visibility, etc.) is available on www.example-publisher.com that the Criteo ID 123 is about to browse
Then our algorithms determine the relevance for buying the advertising space and displaying a personalized ad on it.
Example of decision that would be taken by Criteo: Buy the advertising space available on www.example-publisher.com and display an ad featuring the following products:
Product A, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 showed interest in it during a recent session
Product B, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 is likely to be interested in this product since he/she has viewed product A during a recent session

Please note that the use of our technologies on our partners’ websites and mobile applications is governed by their privacy policies, which can be accessed directly from their websites and/or mobile applications. We require them to provide you with complete and appropriate information and, to the extent required by law, to obtain your consent before any of your personal information is available to us.
Our technologies are able to work in a similar fashion:
on a webpage by relying on cookies, which are supported by most web browsers;
on a mobile application by relying on the mobile advertising ID provided by mobile operating system vendors (e. g. Google and Apple);
on an browser which default settings limit the use of third-party cookies and inter-site tracking, such as Safari, if you provide consent for our services to co-exist with these default settings;
and in a transversal way between the different environments listed above. Find out more about
how our services work from one environment to another (“cross-device linking”)
.
In order to provide you with ads that are better tailored to your interests, we may receive and process audience and segments information derived from the data you accepted to share with trusted third party partners. These partners may send us information regarding your shopping habits (e.g. interested in clothing, furniture or electronics), the points of interest that are near you based on non-precise geolocation information (e.g. stores that are geographically close to you) or the products you have been purchasing in a brick and mortar store of the advertisers that are using our services to manage their online marketing campaigns. In such case, Criteo will only process geolocation information and identifiers (such as cookie IDs and Mobile Advertising IDs) that do not allow us to know who you are.
We believe that the personalization of ads is beneficial to you and the Internet ecosystem in that it contributes to the promotion of a free and open Internet by allowing Publishers to monetize the content they create, while allowing you to benefit from ads that may be more interesting to you than non-personalized ads that would be displayed to you.
Our privacy pillars
We have developed our services and technologies taking great care to respect your privacy.
Data minimisation
We undertake never to use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc. Without ever being able to identify you personally, our technologies are able to recognize your devices and/or browsers on the basis of an identifier consisting of a series of characters (identifier contained in a cookie or other). However, these data are qualified as personal data by European regulations and personal information by Californian law. As such, they are the subject of our greatest vigilance in terms of security and respect for your privacy.
Privacy by design
Our product teams develop every feature with privacy in mind; it’s the cornerstone of Privacy by Design, Criteo’s long-standing practice and commitment to ensuring industry-leading privacy, security and safety for consumers and marketers.
Key elements include:
As required by the GDPR, we have had a designated Data Privacy Officer since 2013 along with a team of privacy experts.
These experts sit within the Product and R&D organization. They perform ongoing Privacy Impact Assessments to monitor potential risks during the product lifecycle and proactively mitigate those risks.
The Data Privacy team delivers company-wide privacy training, enforces codes of conduct, and is integral to ensuring that we build best-in-class products and services.
We regularly review and document our internal policies, amend existing privacy policies as necessary, and enforce these policies with our partners and vendors.
Criteo's commitments
Our ads do not require:
To collect data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, your postal address, or your email address in plain text.
To collect sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health or sexual orientation …) to create segments or target ads to users. For the sole purpose of serving ads on a Publisher’s properties that could possibly reveal sensitive information (eg. a medical website), we may collect the URL of the website or the name of the mobile application.
To collect irrevocable identifiers, such as the hardware identifiers of the devices you use (UDID or MAC address, etc.).
To collect data related to your precise geolocation in real time.

Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you

Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Your privacy & Hotjar
From day one, Hotjar was designed and built with privacy in mind. We wanted to help our customers improve their websites and create better user experiences, while keeping privacy at the core of our software—and we’ve been doing it since 2014.
Today, Hotjar is used on over 900,000 websites in 180+ countries. We believe we have a responsibility to set the example and protect not just the privacy of our customers, but also that of the people who visit their websites—in other words: you.

Your privacy & Hotjar
From day one, Hotjar was designed and built with privacy in mind. We wanted to help our customers improve their websites and create better user experiences, while keeping privacy at the core of our software—and we’ve been doing it since 2014.
Today, Hotjar is used on over 900,000 websites in 180+ countries. We believe we have a responsibility to set the example and protect not just the privacy of our customers, but also that of the people who visit their websites—in other words: you.
Improving websites, for you.
Online businesses use Hotjar to create better website experiences.
Nobody wants to waste their time on a website that is confusing and hard to navigate.
You know it, we know it, and website owners know it too—which is why they turn to Hotjar.
Website owners use Hotjar to better understand user behavior: what actions people take on a website, what elements of a page they click or ignore, what they enjoy, where they struggle. With this insight, website owners can then make changes that improve the overall experience for all website users. And that includes you.
Show more
We record interactions, not your sensitive data.
Hotjar is designed for websites to get insights. And respect your privacy.
When you browse a website that has Hotjar installed, we collect data about your interactions (e.g. where you click, scroll your mouse, move in between pages) and use it to create visual representations of the experience. Website owners get these insights without tracking IP/MAC addresses-- the stuff that relates to the device you use.
Some Hotjar tools, like session recordings, reconstruct the individual actions you took during a website visit; others, like heatmaps, aggregate data points from you and hundreds of other visitors in one report.
But in all cases, by default, sensitive data that you might enter on the site (your credit card details or phone numbers) will never reach our servers: we cannot see it, and neither can the website owner. Hotjar customers viewing a session recording will only see asterisks (‘***’ ) instead of numbers.
For more information, head over to our
Privacy FAQs.

We will never share or sell your data.
Not to advertisers. Not to third-party services. Not to anyone.
Nobody here at Hotjar likes the idea of tools following us around different websites or companies sharing and selling our data without our permission. We are committed to making sure this doesn’t happen to you, either.
Hotjar is designed to help make websites easier to use, and the data we track about your website visit (for example, what and where you click) is only used for this purpose. We don’t follow you around the Internet: website owners who use Hotjar cannot see or find out about your activity on sites they don’t own. Likewise, we don’t harvest personal data or sell it to anyone, ever, for any reason. Nor do we mine it for profiling or advertising purposes.
To learn more about data privacy, head over to our
Privacy FAQs.
Show more
Request and access your data, anytime.
Your data is stored securely, and you can ask to see it whenever you want.
As a website visitor, you have the right to request access to the personal identifiable information a website owner collected and stored about you. You also have the right to request that this information is deleted.
At any time, you can request a website owner who uses Hotjar to give you access to your data. They can run a search for personal data from inside the Hotjar dashboard; the system will then generate and email you a report that lets you view, and delete, any data connected with you.
To learn more about data privacy and accessing your data, head over to our
Privacy FAQs.

Tracking: we'll always give you options.
If you prefer websites not to track data about your visit, we can help.
If you prefer websites not to track data about your visit, we can help.
If you want to stop a website using Hotjar from collecting data about your visit, you should know that the website owner is responsible for getting your consent to collect and process data about your visit (and must allow you to withdraw that consent as well).
But we understand that you might want Hotjar (and other tools) to not process data about you regardless of whether a site owner asks for permission or not, so we want to give you an extra option. If you put a ‘Do Not Track’ flag on your browser, Hotjar will look for it before we collect any data about your site visit. Not everybody does that, but we do.
For more information about this take a look at our
guide on how ‘Do Not Track’ in your browser works

Compliance commitment: GDPR, CCPA, and more.
Our customers can use Hotjar in a compliant manner, for you.
We have followed a ‘privacy by design’ approach since our very first day, back in 2014, so we’re big supporters of privacy acts and regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) that enhance your privacy rights and protection as a consumer.
We have built the necessary controls around anonymity and consent to make sure website owners who use Hotjar can do it in a compliant manner. Plus, our legal team is fully committed to keeping up-to-date with any changes in the law and making sure they are reflected in our product.
You can read more about GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, and our other commitments over in our
Compliance resources.

We will solely process this Personal Data to provide Our Platform in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.

We temporarily store IP addresses of Customers, Users and Testers of Our Platform for associated performance metrics (i.e. data related to how well Our Platform performs) and to monitor and track application errors. We will never access these IP addresses without any operational or security need. We automatically delete these IP addresses within thirty (30) calendar days.The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. We may use technical data (such as keypresses, timestamps, etc.) collected through the Platform to analyze, develop, improve or optimize the use, function and performance of Our Site, or to make sure we are reaching out to the right audience.

A Customer
may delete their Hotjar account
at any time. Users and Testers may delete their respective accounts through their account settings. After account deletion, We may retain Personal Data (in part or in whole) associated with the Customer, User or Tester to meet any regulatory and reporting requirements for the timeframes stipulated by law and to be able to address customer service issues. Any other Personal Data We were processing relating to Our Customer, Tester and/or Users of that Hotjar account will be deleted permanently within thirty (30) calendar days. This does not apply to any Personal Data collected as part of Customer research within the Engage Product. To maintian the quality of the research data, any research-related Personal Data may need to be kept for a reasonably required time.
We may use Personal Data and other Data about Our Customers, Users and/or Testers (including but not limited to demographic information, location information, information about the computer or device from which they access Our Platform) to create, wherever possible, anonymized and aggregated information and analytics. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
The information We collect from Our Customers, Users and/or Testers is disclosed only in accordance with the Agreement and the Applicable Law.
Personal Data collected from Engage Product Testers
THIS SECTION APPLIES ONLY TO THE REGISTERED TESTERS OF OUR ENGAGE PRODUCT
When a Tester signs up to the Engage Product, we will ask them to share some Personal Data with Us to create a Tester profile. The Tester profile information will be revealed to Hotjar and Our Customers, who may invite you to usability study interviews ("
Interviews
"). The Engage Product has been built to connect Testers with the best-matched Customers for their Interviews. Better matches means happier Customers and more payouts for Testers. We analyse the data Testers provide Us with, along with the information about the Tester’s use of Our Platform, to suggest a good Interview match.
We collect and process Tester Personal Data to allow Testers to participate in Customer research, as well as for database management, managing contacts and sending messages, analytics, managing Our hosting and backend infrastructure, paying Testers for their service, Tester registration and authentication and displaying content from external platforms.
The data categories we will ask Testers to provide in order to build the Tester profile may include but are not limited to, name, age, country of residence, educational background, profession, marital status, phone number and other registration information. This information allows us to effectively match Testers with the right Customers. Testers may also optionally upload an avatar or enter their gender, but can remove this at any time. If a Tester deletes their account, their profile data will be removed too. Depending on the context, the legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
We will also collect information that relates to how Testers use Our Platform. The categories of Personal Data relating to this include but are not limited to timezone, broad location (town or district), web browser, operating system and the device used, referral sources, email engagement data, data on how you use the Engage Product (including last login date and frequency) and account signup date. This information allows Us to personalize the Engage Product to Testers’ needs and to improve Our Engage Product. We do not collect precise, real-time information about the location of a Tester’s device. We delete (or anonymize) such Tester Personal Data as soon as you cancel your account. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
On an entirely voluntary basis, Testers may choose to connect their social media account with their Tester profile. This will grant Us read-only access to their social media account and we will store their social media account ID, along with a secure 'access key' that these social media companies provide to Us. If Tester grants Us access, we may also process their email address that is associated with the social media account, name, profile picture, gender and age range, which we may use to enhance Tester profile data on the Engage Product. We use social media account data as a 'quality signal' to confirm that the Engage Product account belongs to a real person and therefore, sharing of social account data may affect the number of Interview invitations a Tester receives. We will never post content to a Tester’s social profile without their permission and we will never request or access their private messages on these accounts. Testers can choose to disconnect their social media accounts at any time, which will prevent Us from being able to access them. Social media account data will also be deleted if you choose to delete your Hotjar account. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
In order to be able to remunerate Our Testers we will process payment related information that Testers share with Us such as PayPal email address, residential address, etc.. We may also need to keep a history of payments made to Testers. This is needed to comply with accounting and legal rules. This data may be kept up to seven (7) years. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.
Hotjar’s use of Personal Data
Access and Disclosure to Third Parties
We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain technical data analysis, processing and/or storage offerings (e.g., IT and related services). These Third Party service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection and security standards. We only share data with them that is required for the services offered and We contractually bind them to keep any information We share with them as confidential and to process Personal Data only according to Our instructions. The legal basis for such processing would be Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
In addition to services providers, other categories of Third Parties may include:
Vendors/public institutions.
To the extent that this is necessary in order to make use of certain services requiring special expertise (such as legal, accounting or auditing services) We may share Personal Data with vendors of such services or public institutions that offer them (e.g. courts). The legal basis of this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.
If We are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then Data may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract. The legal basis for such processing would be Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Other than the cases mentioned above, We will only transfer Personal Data to Third Parties without express consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR or if We are obliged to do so by statutory law or by instruction from a public authority or court as outlined in Our
Terms of Service
.
Communication Purposes
We may occasionally send notification emails about updates to Our product, legal documents, customer support or for marketing purposes. To the extent required by Applicable Law, We will only send such messages if We have obtained consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. In all other cases, the legal basis of this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Except for cases where We are required to do so by law (e.g. notification of a data breach, providing you with important information about your account, updating our legal documents, etc.), recipients of Our communication shall have the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving these messages free of charge. We process requests to be placed on do-not-contact lists as required by Applicable Law.
Marketing Purposes
We use Personal Data given to Us by Hotjar’s Customers, Users, Testers and/or visitors to Our Site to target advertisements to:
Hotjar’s Customers, Users, Testers and/or visitors to Our Site to keep them informed about Hotjar and any product changes we make; and
Potential new Customers or Testers that appear to have shared interests or similar demographics.
The legal basis of this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
We do this by sharing Personal Data with Third Party marketing platforms that have high privacy and confidentiality standards and which have gone through a legal and security review by Hotjar. This ensures that these Third Parties cannot do anything with the Personal Data We provide them other than use it for the express purpose of providing Us with the marketing services We contract them for.
This Personal Data is only shared with these Third Parties through secure and encrypted means. If you wish to opt out of this processing activity, please contact Us at
dpo@hotjar.com
with the subject line “Opt-Out of Marketing”.
Compliance and Protection
We may use Personal Data to (legal basis for the respective processing in parentheses):
protect Our, Our Customers’/Users’, Testers’, visitors’ to Our Site or Third Parties’ rights, privacy, safety or property including by making and defending legal claims (Article 6(1)(b), (c) or (f) GDPR);
audit Our internal processes for compliance with legal and contractual requirements and internal policies (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR);
enforce Our
Terms of Service
(Article 6(1)(b) or (f) GDPR);
protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity, including cyberattacks and identity theft (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR); and
comply with the Applicable Law, lawful requests and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities (Article 6(1)(c) or (f) GDPR).
Benchmarking
Hotjar reserves the right to use and retain Data in a de-identified and/or aggregated form to improve Our Site and/or Platform and for statistical and benchmarking purposes, including enabling comparisons within the same industry to enhance the insights collected through Our Site and Platform. Benchmarks look at all collected metrics and compare them to others of the same nature. These de-identified and/or aggregated benchmarks may be published and shared publicly within Our Platform or in the form of other content We publish which may show a summary of results for a certain category or question type.
No Data which can individually identify Our Customers, or their end-users, Our Users or Our Testers will ever be shown in this statistical or benchmark data.
The legal basis for aggregating/anonymizing this Personal Data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Intra-group sharing of User and visitor Data
Hotjar is part of the Content Square SAS group (“
Contentsquare
”) which is headquartered in Paris, France. In the course of our normal operations, Hotjar may share Data (e.g. name and contact details, etc.) of Users of Hotjar accounts, Testers, and visitors of Our Site (hotjar.com) with Contentsquare.
The purpose of sharing this Data is to pursue synergies in sales and marketing, which is in both Hotjar’s and Contentsquare’s legitimate commercial interests. The legal basis of this Data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Hotjar and Contentsquare are jointly responsible for these processing activities (so-called joint controllership). If you would like more information in this regard or would like to exercise your rights as described in this Privacy Policy, please contact Us at dpo@hotjar.com.
Other Purposes with Your Consent
In some cases, We may ask you for consent to collect, use or share Personal Data for other purposes. For example, We may ask you for consent to send marketing emails where required by law or to post testimonials or endorsements. In such cases, there will always be the ability to deny or revoke consent if desired. The legal basis for the data processing is under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
Duration of Processing
Unless a different timeframe has been specifically stated in this Privacy Policy or in
Our Pricing Page,
Personal Data will be retained for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which We originally collected it or to provide Our Platform, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, and enforce Our Agreement. We may also retain information as required by Applicable Law.
International Transfers of Personal Data
In most cases, Personal Data We collect is stored in the EU. However, in some limited cases, customer information may be accessed from, or other Personal Data (e.g., email, etc.) may be transferred outside of the EU. These countries may have different data protection laws. Hotjar endeavors to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place requiring that Personal Data will remain protected. Hotjar has concluded Standard Contractual Clauses with entities who We share Personal Data with outside of the EU. Further details about this can be found in Our article on
Data Storage
.
Children’s Information
Hotjar’s Platform is not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children. If you learn that your child has provided Us with Personal Data without your consent, you may contact Us at dpo@hotjar.com. If We learn that We have collected a child’s Personal Data in violation of Applicable Law, We will promptly take steps to investigate this, delete such information and, if applicable, terminate the child’s account. We will also make sure to have preventive measures in place for this not to happen again in the future.

When you have provided consent, you may withdraw it at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out prior to withdrawing it. Whenever you withdraw consent, you acknowledge and accept that this may have a negative influence on the quality of Our Site and/or Platform.

In addition, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your respective data protection authority.
To protect your privacy, We take steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.

Stand: 4. Februar 2025
Dieser Vertrag wird lediglich als Gefälligkeit zur Verfügung gestellt. Es gilt ausschließlich die englische Fassung dieses Vertrags, und in keinem Fall darf die deutsche Sprachfassung dieses Vertrags dahingehend ausgelegt werden, dass sie die englische Fassung dieses Vertrags ändert oder auf andere Weise die Beziehung der Vertragspartner untereinander regelt.
HubSpot verpflichtet sich, Ihre Privatsphäre zu schützen. Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt für die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir im Rahmen unserer Geschäftstätigkeit erheben und verarbeiten. HubSpot geht bei der Datenverarbeitung unterschiedlich vor:
(i) HubSpot fungiert als Verantwortlicher für Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, wenn Sie sich für unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen anmelden, unsere Websites besuchen oder über andere Kanäle (z. B. bei persönlichen Events) mit uns interagieren. Wir verwenden diese Daten für verschiedene Zwecke, unter anderem, um Ihnen unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung zu stellen, Sie bezüglich relevanter Inhalte zu kontaktieren und unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verbessern und zu bewerben.
(ii) HubSpot fungiert als Auftragsverarbeiter, wenn unsere Kunden unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen nutzen, um personenbezogene Daten im Zusammenhang mit ihren Vertriebs-, Marketing- und anderen Geschäftsaktivitäten zu erheben und zu verarbeiten. In diesem Fall handeln wir als Auftragsverarbeiter (oder Dienstanbieter) im Auftrag unserer Kunden (die für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten verantwortlich sind) gemäß der
Vereinbarung zur Datenverarbeitung von HubSpot
, die in den
HubSpot-Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
enthalten ist.
(iii) HubSpot fungiert auch als Verantwortlicher, wenn wir personenbezogene Daten über Personen in ihrer beruflichen Eigenschaft erheben und verarbeiten und diese Informationen Kunden für ihre eigenen Vertriebs-, Marketing- und sonstigen Geschäftsaktivitäten zur Verfügung stellen. Dies umfasst personenbezogene Daten, die wir indirekt über Sie erheben, z. B. aus öffentlich zugänglichen Quellen, von unseren Kunden oder von anderen Dritten. Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Abschnitt „Von uns erfasste und verarbeitete Informationen“.
Für die Zwecke dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie steht „personenbezogene Daten“ für jegliche Art von Informationen zu einer identifizierten oder identifizierbaren Person. Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie beschreibt Ihre Wahlmöglichkeiten und Rechte betreffend Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, einschließlich Ihrer Rechte hinsichtlich der Korrektur und des Zugriffs.
(i) Informationen darüber, wie Sie Ihre Datenschutzrechte ausüben können, wenn HubSpot als Verantwortlicher für personenbezogene Daten fungiert, finden Sie im Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“.
(ii) Um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten aus unserem kommerziellen Datensatz von Fachleuten zu löschen, füllen Sie bitte dieses Formular aus.
(iii) Wenn Sie Ihre Datenschutzrechte in Bezug auf personenbezogene Daten, die wir im Auftrag eines Kunden verarbeiten, ausüben möchten, lesen Sie bitte die Kundenrichtlinien und wenden Sie sich direkt an den Kunden.
Wir aktualisieren diese Datenschutzrichtlinie von Zeit zu Zeit und empfehlen Ihnen, sie regelmäßig durchzulesen. Wir werden alle Änderungen der Datenschutzrichtlinien auf dieser Seite veröffentlichen und Sie, falls die Änderungen wesentlich sind, direkt benachrichtigen (z. B. indem wir Ihnen eine E-Mail-Benachrichtigung senden). Alle Begriffe, sofern in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie nicht anders definiert, haben die in den

1.1 Daten, die Sie HubSpot zur Verfügung stellen.
Wenn Sie mit uns über unsere Websites oder Websites und Dienstleistungen, die einen Link zu dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie enthalten (wie zum Beispiel HubSpot.com oder TheHustle.co), interagieren oder den Abonnementdienst nutzen, können wir personenbezogene Daten und andere Informationen von Ihnen erfassen, was nachfolgend näher beschrieben wird.
1.1.1 Beim Besuch unserer Websites. Wir erfassen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, wenn Sie Webformulare übermitteln oder mit unserer Website interagieren, z. B. wenn Sie einen HubSpot-Blog abonnieren, sich für ein Webinar anmelden, eine unserer Dienstleistungen abonnieren oder den Kundenservice um Unterstützung bitten. Wir können Sie nach Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse, Ihrem Vor- und Nachnamen, Ihrer Berufsbezeichnung und anderen ähnlichen geschäftlichen Informationen fragen. Es steht Ihnen frei, manche unserer Websites zu besuchen, ohne dabei personenbezogene Daten mit uns zu teilen.
1.1.2 Daten in Zusammenhang mit der INBOUND-Konferenz und anderen Events. Wenn Sie sich für
INBOUND
oder ein HubSpot-Event anmelden, erfassen wir Daten wie Ihren Namen, Ihre Adresse, Telefonnummer und E-Mail-Adresse.

Darüber hinaus können wir Ihre Registrierungsdaten an Dienstleister von INBOUND weitergeben, um Eventinformationen bereitzustellen und Ihr Erlebnis während der INBOUND-Konferenz oder zukünftigen HubSpot-Events zu verbessern.
1.1.3 Account- und Benutzerdaten. Wir erfassen personenbezogene Daten, wenn Sie einen HubSpot-Account eröffnen, Benutzerdaten erstellen oder ändern, Präferenzen festlegen oder andere damit zusammenhängende Informationen bereitstellen, um auf unseren Abonnementdienst zuzugreifen oder ihn zu nutzen.
1.1.4 Zahlungsdaten. Wir erfassen Zahlungs- und Rechnungsdaten, wenn Sie sich für kostenpflichtige Produkte oder Dienstleistungen registrieren oder diese erwerben. Wir können Sie zum Beispiel bitten, eine Rechnungsadresse oder einen Rechnungskontakt für Ihren HubSpot-Account anzugeben. Wenn Sie uns Zahlungsdaten zur Verfügung stellen, verwenden wir diese ausschließlich, wie von Ihnen in Übereinstimmung mit dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie autorisiert. Wir setzen sichere Drittanbieter für die Zahlungsabwicklung ein, die über einen sicheren Zahlungsprozess eingezogen wird.
1.1.5 Testimonials. Wir veröffentlichen Testimonials und Kommentare auf unseren Websites, welche personenbezogene Daten enthalten können.
1.2 Daten, die wir im Namen von Kunden verarbeiten, wenn diese den Abonnementdienst nutzen.
Mit unserem Produkt (bzw. dem Abonnementdienst) können unsere Benutzer Inhalte für Marketing, Vertrieb und den Kundendienst erstellen und teilen. Im Rahmen ihrer Nutzung unseres Produktes können unsere Kunden personenbezogene Daten wie Vor- und Nachnamen, E-Mail-Adressen, Postadressen oder Telefonnummern verarbeiten. Die Informationen, die unsere Kunden über das Produkt übermitteln oder erheben, bezeichnen wir gemäß unseren
Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
als „Kundendaten“.
In der Regel speichern und verarbeiten wir Informationen über und im Namen unserer Kunden auf unseren Servern als Auftragsverarbeiter (oder Dienstanbieter) auf der Grundlage der Anweisungen eines Kunden und in Übereinstimmung mit unseren
HubSpot-Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
.  Jeder Kunde kontrolliert und ist verantwortlich für die Informationen, die er mit einem Abonnementdienst verarbeitet, sowie für die Einhaltung von Vorschriften oder Gesetzen, die eine Benachrichtigung, Offenlegung und/oder Einholung der Zustimmung vor der Übermittlung der personenbezogenen Daten an HubSpot zu Verarbeitungszwecken vorschreiben.
Wenn Sie Fragen zu den personenbezogenen Daten haben, die wir im Auftrag eines Kunden verarbeiten, wenden Sie sich bitte direkt an den Kunden und lesen Sie dessen Richtlinien.
1.3 Daten, die wir sammeln und verarbeiten, wenn Sie den Abonnementdienst nutzen.
1.3.1 Nutzungsdaten. Wir erfassen Nutzungsdaten, wenn Sie oder Ihre Benutzer über Ihren HubSpot-Account mit dem Abonnementdienst interagieren. Zu den Nutzungsdaten gehören Kennzahlen und Informationen über Ihre Nutzung und Interaktion mit dem Abonnementdienst, z. B. welche Produktfunktionen Sie am häufigsten nutzen, wann ein Objekt (z. B. ein Ticket) geöffnet und geschlossen wird und wie oft bestimmte Funktionen (z. B. Workflows) in Ihrem Account ausgelöst werden.
Wir beauftragen Drittanbieter mit der Erhebung von Nutzungsdaten. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie wir Ihre Daten im Rahmen der Zusammenarbeit mit diesen Dienstleistern schützen, finden Sie im Abschnitt „Wie wir personenbezogene Daten teilen“.
1.3.2 Mobilgeräte. Wenn Sie über unsere mobilen Apps auf den Abonnementdienst zugreifen, erfassen wir automatisch Daten wie Modell, Version und IDs Ihres Geräts sowie die Version des Betriebssystems.
1.3.3 Protokolldateien. Wie die meisten Websites und Technologiedienste, die über das Internet bereitgestellt werden, erfassen und speichern wir automatisch Informationen über Ihre Computerhardware und -software, wenn Sie unsere Websites besuchen, unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen nutzen oder andere Websites oder Dienstleistungen aufrufen, die einen Link zu dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie enthalten. Diese Daten können Ihre IP-Adresse umfassen, den Browsertyp, Domain-Namen, den Internet-Service-Provider (ISP) und die auf unserer Website angesehenen Dateien (z. B. HTML-Seiten und Grafiken), die auf den Websites unserer Kunden angesehenen Dateien (falls diese Websites über HubSpot gehostet werden, z. B. HTML-Seiten und Grafiken etc.), Ihr Betriebssystem, Zugriffszeiten und Adressen von Websites, über die Sie auf unsere Website gelangt sind.
Wenn Sie den Abonnementdienst nutzen, erfassen und speichern wir in den folgenden Fällen und vorbehaltlich der Implementierungseinstellungen des Kunden die oben aufgeführten Arten von Informationen in Protokollen:
(i) wenn sich ein HubSpot-Benutzer bei seinem Account anmeldet und auf Tools auf der Plattform von HubSpot zugreift;
(ii) wenn eine Person die Website eines Kunden besucht, sofern die Website über unser Produkt oder unsere Dienste gehostet wird; oder
(iii) wenn eine Person die Website eines Kunden besucht, sofern die Website des Kunden selbstgehostet ist, wenn der Kunde unsere Plug-ins verwendet und wenn der Kunde HubSpot-Skripte und -Content (wie eingebettete Formulare) nutzt; oder
(iv) Funktionen und Inhalte von Drittanbietern und anderen Unternehmen.
Unsere Websites können Funktionen und Widgets enthalten (z. B. die Schaltfläche zum Teilen und für „Gefällt mir“-Angaben oder interaktive Miniprogramme), die auf unseren Websites ausgeführt werden. Diese Funktionen können Ihre IP-Adresse und die von Ihnen auf unseren Websites besuchten Seiten erfassen und sie können ein Cookie setzen, um die korrekte Ausführung der Funktion zu ermöglichen. Derartige Funktionen und Widgets werden entweder von Dritten oder direkt auf unseren Websites gehostet.
1.3.4 Integrationen mit Dritten.
Sie können Ihren HubSpot-Account mit Integrationen von Dritten verbinden, die möglicherweise bestimmte Berechtigungen für den Zugriff auf Daten oder das Senden von Daten an Ihren HubSpot-Account verlangen. Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, alle von Ihnen genehmigten Integrationen von Dritten zu überprüfen. Wir können Informationen darüber sammeln, welche Integrationen Sie in Ihrem HubSpot-Account nutzen.
Die von Ihnen erteilte(n) Genehmigung(en) gewährt/gewähren diesen Dritten Zugriff auf Ihre Daten, was unter anderem bedeuten kann, dass Drittanbieteranwendungen Zugriff auf die Daten Ihres HubSpot-Accounts erhalten, diese speichern und ändern können.  Wir sind nicht für die Praktiken von Drittanbieterintegrationen verantwortlich. Bitte prüfen Sie daher sorgfältig die Berechtigungen, die Sie Anwendungen von Drittanbietern gewähren.
Tipp zu HubSpots Vertragsbedingungen: Weitere Informationen über Integrationen mit Drittanbietern finden Sie in folgendem Artikel der Wissensdatenbank:
Apps mit HubSpot verknüpfen
.
1.4 Von uns erfasste Daten aus anderen Quellen.
1.4.1 HubSpot-Partner. Wir können Daten über Sie oder andere Benutzer Ihres HubSpot-Accounts (falls zutreffend) von unserem globalen Partnernetzwerk erhalten. Wir können diese Daten auf verschiedene Weise erhalten, u. a. durch unsere Geschäfts- und Lead-Registrierungsprozesse.
Wir können auch Daten über Sie über unsere Co-Marketing-Vereinbarungen mit Partnern einholen. Sie könnten sich zum Beispiel für ein Webinar anmelden oder ein von HubSpot und einem seiner Co-Marketing-Partner veröffentlichtes Whitepaper herunterladen. Weitere Informationen zu unserem Co-Marketing-Programm finden Sie unter https://www.hubspot.com/co-marketing-request-form. Weitere Informationen über die Weitergabe von Daten an unsere Partner finden Sie im Unterabschnitt „Partner“ des Punkts „Wie wir personenbezogene Daten teilen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie.
1.4.2 Drittanbieter. Wir können Daten von Drittanbietern, von verbundenen Unternehmen und von unseren Geschäfts- und Solutions Partnern erhalten.
1.4.3 Personenbezogene Daten aus anderen Quellen. Wir können personenbezogene Daten über Sie aus anderen Quellen sammeln, z. B. von Drittanbietern und öffentlich zugänglichen Quellen (wie Social-Media-Plattformen). Dazu gehören Postadressen, Jobbezeichnungen, E-Mail-Adressen, Telefonnummern, IP-Adressen und Social-Media-Profile. Dies hilft uns, unsere Produkte, Dienstleistungen und Aufzeichnungen zu aktualisieren und zu verbessern, neue Kunden zu identifizieren, personalisierte Werbung zu erstellen, Produkte und Dienstleistungen vorzuschlagen, die Sie interessieren könnten, personalisierte Mitteilungen zu versenden und Events zu bewerben.
1.4.4 Andere HubSpot-Unternehmen und Affiliate-Partner. Wir können Daten über Sie von anderen Unternehmen erhalten, die sich im Besitz von HubSpot befinden oder von HubSpot betrieben werden.
1.5 Daten, die wir in Verbindung mit unseren Anreicherungsprodukten sammeln und verarbeiten. HubSpot sammelt Geschäftskontaktdaten und ähnliche berufliche Daten aus verschiedenen Quellen, einschließlich öffentlich zugänglicher Quellen, Drittanbietern und Kunden, die unsere Anreicherungsprodukte verwenden. Diese Informationen bilden die Grundlage für unseren kommerziellen Datensatz. Wir stellen Informationen aus unserem kommerziellen Datensatz Kunden zur Verfügung, die sich für die Nutzung von Anreicherungsprodukten innerhalb der Abonnementdienste als Teil ihrer Verkaufs-, Marketing- und anderen Geschäftsaktivitäten entscheiden.
Wenn Sie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten aus unserem kommerziellen Datensatz entfernen möchten, füllen Sie
dieses Formular
aus und senden Sie es ab. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie Sie Ihre Datenschutzrechte und Wahlmöglichkeiten wahrnehmen können, finden Sie im Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“.

HubSpot verwendet die durch den Tracking-Code gesammelten Daten, wie IP-Adressen und Online-Kennungen, um unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verbessern, einschließlich unseres kommerziellen Datensatzes.

. WIE WIR PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN VERWENDEN
2.1 Um mit Ihnen über das Produkt und die Dienstleistungen zu kommunizieren. Wir verwenden die Accountdaten, die Sie HubSpot bei der Anmeldung für unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung stellen, um Ihnen Transaktions-E-Mails oder In-App-Benachrichtigungen über die Rechnungsstellung, die Accountverwaltung und andere administrative Angelegenheiten zu senden.
Wir verwenden Ihre Daten auch, um Ihnen neue Produkte und Services zu empfehlen und für den Kundenservice, z. B. zur Lösung von technischen Problemen und zur Analyse von Produktausfällen oder Fehlern.
Wenn Sie die Mobile-Apps von HubSpot verwenden, können wir Ihnen gelegentlich Push-Benachrichtigungen senden, um Sie über aktuelle Ereignisse oder Promotions zu informieren. Wenn Sie diese Mitteilungen nicht mehr erhalten möchten, können Sie diese auf Ihrem Gerät deaktivieren.
2.2 Zur Bereitstellung des Abonnementdienstes. Wir verwenden Ihre Account- und Kundendaten, um Ihnen das Produkt und die Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung zu stellen. Zum Beispiel verwenden wir die E-Mail-Adresse, die Sie bei der Registrierung angeben, um Ihren Account zu erstellen, und wir verwenden Ihre Zahlungsinformationen, um Zahlungen für die kostenpflichtige Nutzung des Abonnementdienstes zu verarbeiten. Wir nutzen diese Informationen auch, um Sie bei der Anmeldung zu authentifizieren, und für den Kundenservice.
2.3 Um unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verbessern und weiterzuentwickeln. Wir verwenden Berufsdaten, Protokolldateien und Nutzungsdaten darüber, wie Sie oder Ihre Benutzer mit unseren Produkten und Dienstleistungen interagieren, um unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu entwickeln und zu verbessern. So verwenden wir beispielsweise Nutzungsdaten, um Trends und die Nutzung des Produkts zu bewerten und um festzustellen, welche neuen Funktionen oder Integrationen für unsere Benutzer von Interesse sein könnten.
Wir können Kundendaten verwenden, um Produktfunktionen und -eigenschaften im Rahmen des Abonnementdienstes und ähnlicher AI-Produkte und Dienstleistungen, die sich auf maschinelle Lernverfahren stützen, zu unterstützen und zu entwickeln. Sie können der Verwendung Ihrer Kundendaten zum Trainieren von HubSpot-Modellen widersprechen, indem Sie eine E-Mail an
privacy@hubspot.com
senden.
Wir können Daten darüber veröffentlichen, wie unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen von unseren Kunden genutzt werden. Wenn wir auf diese Weise statistische Informationen an Dritte weitergeben, werden die Daten aggregiert und wir identifizieren keine einzelnen Benutzer oder Kunden. Wir können zum Beispiel Blogbeiträge über Trends oder Einblicke in die Interaktion der Benutzer mit unserem Produkt veröffentlichen.
Tipp zu HubSpots Vertragsbedingungen: Bitte lesen Sie den Artikel
Von der Datennutzung für maschinelles Lernen von HubSpot abmelden
in der Wissensdatenbank, um mehr darüber zu erfahren, wie Ihre Kundendaten zum Trainieren von HubSpot-Modellen verwendet werden.
2.4 Zur Sicherung und zum Schutz unseres Produktes und der HubSpot-Benutzer. Wir verwenden Ihre Accountdaten, um Sicherheitsvorfälle zu untersuchen und zu verhindern. Außerdem können wir diese Daten verwenden, um gesetzliche Anforderungen zu erfüllen. Wir nutzen Ihre Daten, um Accounts und neue Produktanmeldungen zu verifizieren und um Produktmissbrauch zu erkennen und zu verhindern. Dazu gehört auch die Durchsetzung unserer
Richtlinie zur akzeptablen Nutzung
.
Wir verwenden Protokolldateien, um allgemeine Statistiken über Ihre Nutzung der Websites zu erstellen, einschließlich der Art und Weise, wie Sie unsere Websites nutzen, um festzustellen, aus welchem Land Sie sich einloggen (für Analytics, zur Exportkontrolle und zu regulatorischen Zwecken) und um die Navigation zu verbessern. Auch Ihre IP-Adressen werden aus Sicherheitsgründen und zur Fehlerbehebung erfasst und protokolliert, zum Beispiel um Zugriffsmuster zu verfolgen und Sicherheitsereignisse und Vorfälle zu untersuchen. Dazu verknüpfen wir diese automatisch erfassten Daten mit anderen personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen, wie Namen, E-Mail-Adressen, Adressen und Telefonnummern.
2.5 Um den Abonnementdienst zu vermarkten und zu bewerben. Wir verwenden personenbezogene Daten, um unsere Produkte, Dienstleistungen und anderen Angebote zu bewerben und zu vermarkten. Zum Beispiel nutzen wir die Daten, etwa Ihre physische oder E-Mail-Adresse, um Ihnen per Post, E-Mail oder auf sonstigem Weg Informationen oder HubSpot-Inhalte zu senden, von denen wir glauben, dass sie für Sie von Interesse sein könnten, z. B. per Post, E-Mail oder auf anderem Wege.  Wir können Ihnen auch Marketingnachrichten in Bezug auf unser Geschäft senden.
Sie können sich gegen den Empfang derartiger Werbeinhalte entscheiden. Befolgen Sie dafür einfach die Anleitungen, die in jeder von uns versendeten Mitteilung enthalten sind. Wenn Sie sich von unseren Marketinglisten abmelden, werden wir Sie dennoch weiterhin zu administrativen Zwecken kontaktieren und auf Ihre Anfragen reagieren.
Wir können Sie telefonisch kontaktieren, um Sie über andere HubSpot-Produkte oder -Dienstleistungen zu informieren, die Sie interessieren könnten. Wenn Sie ein Telefongespräch mit einem HubSpot-Mitarbeiter vereinbart haben, können wir das Gespräch aufzeichnen und transkribieren. Sie werden vor dem Telefonat darüber informiert, dass das Gespräch aufgezeichnet wird, und haben die Möglichkeit, die Aufzeichnung abzulehnen.  Wir können Sie auch per SMS kontaktieren, und Sie werden die Möglichkeit haben, sich von diesen Mitteilungen abzumelden.
Sofern gesetzlich zulässig erfolgt der Versand von Marketingkommunikation nur mit Ihrer Zustimmung. Andernfalls bewerben und vermarkten wir unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen auf Basis unserer legitimen Geschäftsinteressen.
Wir können die von Drittanbietern und anderen Quellen gesammelten Daten in Kombination mit anderen Daten, die wir auf andere in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebene Weise sammeln, verwenden, um Ihnen Aktualisierungen und verbesserte Dienste, personalisierte Mitteilungen, Event-Werbung und eine anderweitige Verbesserung der Benutzererfahrung zu bieten.
2.6 Andere Zwecke, wenn wir Ihre Zustimmung erhalten. Wir können Ihre Daten für andere Zwecke verwenden, wenn Sie uns Ihre Zustimmung dazu geben.
2.7 Rechtliche Grundlage für die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten (gilt nur für Besucher aus dem EWR und dem Vereinigten Königreich). Wenn Sie ein Websitebesucher mit Sitz im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum („EWR“) oder Vereinigten Königreich („UK“) sind, ist HubSpot Ireland Limited für die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten verantwortlich. Den Datenschutzbeauftragten von HubSpot erreichen Sie
hier
.
Die rechtliche Grundlage für unser Erheben und unsere Verwendung der oben beschriebenen personenbezogenen Daten hängt von den jeweiligen personenbezogenen Daten und dem konkreten Kontext ab, in dem wir diese erheben. Dennoch gilt, dass wir personenbezogene Daten normalerweise nur dann von Ihnen erheben, wenn Sie dem zugestimmt haben, wenn wir die personenbezogenen Daten benötigen, um eine zwischen uns und Ihnen bestehende Vertragsvereinbarung zu erfüllen, oder wenn die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten unseren legitimen Interessen dient und diese nicht gegen Ihre Datenschutzinteressen beziehungsweise gegen Grundrechte verstoßen oder Ihre Freiheiten verletzen. In manchen Fällen kann es auch sein, dass wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind, personenbezogene Daten zu Ihnen einzuholen.
Wenn wir Sie auffordern, personenbezogene Daten zur Verfügung zu stellen, um gesetzliche Auflagen oder eine vertragliche Vereinbarung zwischen uns und Ihnen zu erfüllen, stellen wir dies zum gegebenen Zeitpunkt klar und weisen Sie darauf hin, ob Sie die Angaben machen müssen oder nicht (ebenso weisen wir Sie auf die möglichen Konsequenzen hin, falls Sie die betreffenden Informationen nicht zur Verfügung stellen). Entsprechend gilt, dass wir Sie dann, wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zur Verfolgung unserer legitimen Interessen (oder der legitimen Interessen Dritter) erheben, zum gegebenen Zeitpunkt darüber informieren, um welche legitimen Interessen es sich konkret handelt.

. WIE WIR PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN TEILEN
3.1 Dienstanbieter. Wir können personenbezogene Daten mit Drittanbietern teilen, die die Bereitstellung unserer Websites, Produkte und Dienstleistungen unterstützen. So nutzen wir zum Beispiel Serviceanbieter für das Datenhosting, die Anwendungsentwicklung, das Marketing sowie für den Vertriebs- und Kundensupport. Daher müssen wir Ihre Daten unter Umständen mit Serviceanbietern teilen, um Ihnen Informationen über Produkte und Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung zu stellen. Zu diesen Dienstleistungen gehören unter anderem Folgende: Die Löschung redundanter Daten aus Listen potenzieller Kunden, die Datenanalyse oder statistische Auswertung Ihrer Nutzung des Abonnementdienstes oder Ihrer Website-Interaktionen, die Unterstützung von Marketingtätigkeiten, die Abwicklung von Kreditkartenzahlungen, die Ergänzung Ihrer uns gegenüber gemachten Angaben, um Ihnen einen besseren Service bieten zu können, die Weiterentwicklung und Verbesserung unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen sowie die Erbringung von Kundendienst- und Supportleistungen. Diesen Dienstleistern ist es untersagt, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für andere als die genannten Zwecke zu verwenden, und sie sind verpflichtet, Ihre Daten vertraulich zu behandeln. In allen Fällen, in denen wir Ihre Daten auf diese Weise weitergeben, verpflichten wir den Drittanbieter ausdrücklich zur Bestätigung und Einhaltung unserer Datenschutzrichtlinie und -standards.
3.2 Partner. Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an vertrauenswürdige HubSpot-Partner weitergeben: (i) damit diese Sie auf der Grundlage Ihrer Kommunikationspräferenzen kontaktieren können; (ii) um uns bei der Durchführung statistischer Analysen zu helfen; (iii) um Vertriebsunterstützung zu leisten; (iv) um Kundensupport zu leisten; und (v) um unsere Partnerprogramme und Abonnementdienste zu verbessern. Partnern ist es untersagt, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für andere als die genannten Zwecke zu verwenden, und sie sind verpflichtet, Ihre Daten vertraulich zu behandeln.
Wir unterhalten auch Partnerschaften mit vertrauenswürdigen externen Parteien, um Ihnen Co-Marketing-Inhalte anzubieten, von denen wir glauben, dass Sie Interesse an ihnen haben können. Wenn Sie mit diesen Co-Marketing-Partnern interagieren, informieren wir Sie, mit wem wir Ihre Daten teilen, und wir stellen Ihnen einen Link zur Datenschutzrichtlinie des betreffenden Co-Marketing-Partners zur Verfügung. So können Sie sich über ihre Datenschutzpraktiken informieren und darüber, wie Sie die Mitteilungen des betreffenden Co-Marketing-Partners gegebenenfalls abbestellen können. Sie werden immer die Wahl haben, ob Sie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an unsere Co-Marketing-Partner weitergeben möchten. Besagte Co-Marketing-Partner werden von uns angehalten, unsere Datenschutz- und Datensicherheitsrichtlinien zu befolgen. Nähere Informationen zu unserem Co-Marketing-Programm finden Sie auf
dieser Seite
.
3.3 Werbepartner. Wir erlauben Werbenetzwerken, Informationen über Ihre Interaktionen mit unseren Websites zu sammeln, um personalisierte Werbung von HubSpot zu schalten. Wir können personenbezogene Daten, wie z. B. Ihre E-Mail-Adresse, auch an unsere Werbepartner weitergeben, um personalisierte Werbung von HubSpot auf den Websites oder mobilen Apps anderer Unternehmen zu schalten.  Mit diesem
Formular
können Sie der Weitergabe Ihrer Daten an unsere Werbepartner widersprechen.
3.4 Veränderungen der Unternehmensstruktur. Wenn wir (oder unsere Aktiva) von einem anderen Unternehmen erworben werden (durch Fusion, Übernahme, Konkurs oder anderweitig), übernimmt das betreffende Unternehmen sämtliche von HubSpot auf den Websites und über den Abonnementdienst erfassten Informationen. In diesem Fall erhalten Sie eine Benachrichtigung per E-Mail oder es erfolgt eine auffällige Mitteilung auf unserer Website über die Veränderung der Eigentumsverhältnisse und deren Konsequenzen für die Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten und Ihrer Wahlmöglichkeiten bezüglich Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten.
3.5 Öffentliche Foren. Unsere Websites können öffentlich zugängliche Internetforen, Blogs und Community-Foren (z. B. die HubSpot Community, Connect.com usw.) anbieten. Wenn Sie Daten direkt über unsere öffentlichen Internetforen, Blogs oder Foren offenlegen (einschließlich der Profilinformationen des Accounts, über den Sie die Daten veröffentlichen), bedenken Sie bitte, dass diese Daten von jeder Person, die auf diese Websites zugreift, gelesen, erfasst und verwertet werden können. Ihre Beiträge und bestimmte Profilinformationen können auch nach der Kündigung Ihres Accounts erhalten bleiben. Wir bitten Sie, die Vertraulichkeit aller Daten, die Sie auf diese Weise veröffentlichen, zu berücksichtigen. Auf Ihre Anfrage hin berichtigen oder löschen wir Daten, die Sie auf den Websites veröffentlicht haben, wie in Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschrieben. In einigen Fällen sind wir nicht in der Lage, Ihre Daten zu löschen. In diesem Fall werden wir Sie darüber informieren und Ihnen den Grund dafür mitteilen, sofern dies zulässig ist.
3.6 Obligatorische Offenlegung. Wir behalten uns das Recht vor, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu verwenden oder offenzulegen, wenn wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind oder wenn wir der begründeten Ansicht sind, dass die Verwendung oder Offenlegung notwendig ist, um unsere Rechte, Ihre Sicherheit oder die Sicherheit anderer zu schützen, Betrugsfällen nachzugehen oder ein Gesetz, eine gerichtliche Verfügung oder die Auflagen eines rechtlichen Verfahrens zu erfüllen. Wenn Sie den Abonnementdienst nutzen, gelten die Kundendaten als vertrauliche Informationen. Weitere Informationen dazu finden Sie im Abschnitt „Vertraulichkeit“ in den
Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
. HubSpot teilt Daten zu Kundeninformationsanfragen. Mehr dazu erfahren Sie in unserem
Bericht über Datenoffenlegung und Transparenz
.
3.7 HubSpot, andere Unternehmen und Affiliate-Partner. Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an unsere derzeitigen und zukünftigen Muttergesellschaften, Affiliate-Partner, Tochtergesellschaften und andere Unternehmen unter gemeinsamer Kontrolle und in gemeinsamem Besitz weitergeben, soweit dies erforderlich ist, um Ihre Anfrage zu erfüllen oder für andere Zwecke, die gemäß dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie zulässig sind.
3.8 HubSpot-Kunden in Verbindung mit unseren Anreicherungsprodukten. Wir können personenbezogene Daten über Personen in unserem kommerziellen Datenbestand an unsere Kunden weitergeben, die unsere Anreicherungsprodukte verwenden. Kunden können diese Informationen für ihre Verkaufs- und Marketingaktivitäten nutzen. Wir stützen uns auf unsere berechtigten Interessen sowie die unserer Kunden, um Daten für die aufgeführten Zwecke zu sammeln und weiterzugeben. Die berechtigten Interessen von HubSpot und unseren Kunden sind nicht wichtiger als Ihre Datenschutzrechte, und wir verarbeiten Ihre Daten auf der Grundlage, dass Menschen erwarten würden, dass ihre arbeitsbezogenen Daten auf diese Weise weitergegeben werden.

. WIE WIR PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN INTERNATIONAL ÜBERMITTELN
4.1 Übermittlung ins Ausland innerhalb der HubSpot-Gruppe. Zur Erleichterung unserer globalen Geschäftstätigkeit können wir Informationen, die personenbezogene Daten enthalten können, an andere HubSpot Affiliate-Partner weitergeben, die als Unterauftragsverarbeiter fungieren, wo wir zu den in dieser Richtlinie beschriebenen Zwecken tätig sind. Eine Liste mit den verbundenen Unternehmen von HubSpot und ihren Standorten finden Sie in
Anlage 3 unserer Vereinbarung zur Datenverarbeitung für Kunden
.
Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt auch im Falle der Übertragung personenbezogener Daten in andere Länder. Wir haben angemessene Vorkehrungen getroffen, um zu gewährleisten, dass Ihre personenbezogenen Daten unabhängig vom Zielort der Übermittlung geschützt bleiben. Wenn wir personenbezogene Daten von Personen im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum („EWR“), in der Schweiz oder im Vereinigten Königreich („UK“) innerhalb der HubSpot-Partner und zwischen diesen weitergeben, stützen wir uns auf die Standardvertragsklauseln (die von der Europäischen Kommission und den Schweizer Behörden genehmigt wurden) und den britischen Zusatz zu den Standardvertragsklauseln (der von den britischen Behörden genehmigt wurde), sofern erforderlich.  Darüber hinaus verfügen wir gegebenenfalls über zusätzliche Schutzmaßnahmen (z. B. sichere Verschlüsselungsmethoden nach kommerziellem Industriestandard zum Schutz von Kundendaten im Ruhezustand und bei der Übertragung, TLS für von HubSpot gehostete Websites, Schutz durch Web Application Firewalls und andere geeignete vertragliche und organisatorische Maßnahmen), die im
HubSpot Trust Center
näher beschrieben werden.
4.2 Übermittlung an Dritte im Ausland. Manche unserer in vorliegender Datenschutzrichtlinie genannten, externen Dienstleister haben ihren Sitz in Ländern, deren Datenschutzgesetze eventuell nicht den Standards entsprechen, die in Ihrem Land gelten. Wenn wir personenbezogene Daten von Personen im EWR, in der Schweiz oder im Vereinigten Königreich an Dritte weitergeben, verwenden wir eine Reihe von rechtlichen Verfahren, um die Übermittlung zu schützen, darunter die von der Europäischen Kommission genehmigten Standardvertragsklauseln zum Datenschutz sowie gegebenenfalls zusätzliche Sicherheitsvorkehrungen. Für die Datenübermittlung aus dem Vereinigten Königreich oder in das Vereinigte Königreich beachten wir das Addendum für das Vereinigte Königreich. Für die Datenübermittlung aus oder nach Kanada halten wir die Standardvertragsklauseln ein. In Bezug auf personenbezogene Daten, die aus Kanada erhalten oder nach Kanada übertragen werden, untersteht HubSpot der Vollstreckungsgewalt des Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Bitte setzen Sie sich mit uns in Verbindung, wenn Sie weitere Informationen zu den gesetzlichen Regelungen benötigen, die wir befolgen, um personenbezogene Daten außerhalb des EWR, der Schweiz, Kanadas und des Vereinigten Königreichs zu übertragen.
4.3 Hinweis zum Datenschutzrahmen. HubSpot hält sich an den EU-U.S.-Datenschutzrahmen („EU-U.S. DPF“), die britische Erweiterung des EU-U.S. DPF und das „Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework“ („Swiss-U.S. DPF“), wie vom U.S. Department of Commerce festgelegt (zusammen „der Datenschutzrahmen“).
HubSpot hat gegenüber dem US-Handelsministerium bestätigt, dass es die EU-US-DPF-Grundsätze in Bezug auf die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten aus der Europäischen Union und dem Vereinigten Königreich (und Gibraltar) sowie die Swiss-US DPF-Grundsätze in Bezug auf die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten aus der Schweiz einhält. Im Falle eines Widerspruchs zwischen dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens sind die Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens maßgeblich. Weitere Informationen zum Datenschutzrahmen und eine Ansicht der Zertifizierung von HubSpot finden Sie auf
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
Wenn Sie in der EU, dem Vereinigten Königreich oder der Schweiz ansässig sind, haben Sie das Recht, Zugang zu den personenbezogenen Daten zu erhalten, die wir über Sie gespeichert haben. Außerdem haben Sie das Recht, die Berichtigung, Ergänzung oder Löschung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen, wenn diese unzutreffend sind oder unter Verstoß gegen die Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmen verarbeitet werden. Wir geben Ihnen die Möglichkeit, Ihre Zustimmung zu verweigern, wenn personenbezogene Daten, die wir über Sie kontrollieren, an einen unabhängigen Dritten weitergegeben oder für einen Zweck verwendet werden sollen, der sich wesentlich von den in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie dargelegten unterscheidet. Wenn Sie eines Ihrer Rechte ausüben möchten, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte über die unten angegebenen Kontaktmöglichkeiten.
In Übereinstimmung mit den Prinzipien des Datenschutz-Rahmens verpflichtet sich HubSpot, Beschwerden im Zusammenhang mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens über die Erhebung und Verwendung Ihrer persönlichen Daten zu klären. Personen aus der EU, dem Vereinigten Königreich und der Schweiz, die Anfragen oder Beschwerden bezüglich unseres Umgangs mit persönlichen Daten haben, die wir unter Berufung auf die Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens erhalten haben, sollten sich zunächst über
privacy@hubspot.com
an HubSpot wenden. Wir werden alle Beschwerden im Zusammenhang mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens innerhalb von 45 Tagen untersuchen und versuchen, sie zu lösen.
In Übereinstimmung mit dem Datenschutzrahmen verpflichtet sich HubSpot, ungelöste Beschwerden über unseren Umgang mit personenbezogenen Daten, die wir unter Berufung auf den Datenschutz-Rahmen erhalten haben, an einen Anbieter für alternative Streitbeilegung mit Sitz in den Vereinigten Staaten weiterzuleiten. Wenn Sie von uns keine zeitnahe Eingangsbestätigung für Ihre Beschwerde im Zusammenhang mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens erhalten oder wenn wir Ihre Beschwerde im Zusammenhang mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens nicht zu Ihrer Zufriedenheit bearbeitet haben, besuchen Sie bitte
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
. Hier finden Sie weitere Informationen oder können eine Beschwerde einreichen. Die Dienstleistungen von TRUSTe Dispute Resolution sind für Sie kostenlos.
Unter bestimmten Umständen, die ausführlicher auf der Website für die Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens beschrieben werden, haben Sie möglicherweise das Recht, ein rechtsverbindliches Schiedsgericht anzurufen, wenn andere Verfahren zur Beilegung von Streitigkeiten ausgeschöpft wurden. Die US-amerikanische Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ist für die Einhaltung der Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens durch HubSpot verantwortlich. HubSpot unterliegt den Ermittlungs- und Durchsetzungsbefugnissen der FTC.
Im Zusammenhang mit einer Weitergabe ist HubSpot für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten verantwortlich, die das Unternehmen im Rahmen der Grundsätze des Datenschutz-Rahmens empfängt und anschließend an Dritte übermittelt, die als Bevollmächtigte für HubSpot handeln. HubSpot bleibt nach den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens haftbar, wenn die von uns bevollmächtigte Person Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in einer Weise verarbeitet, die nicht mit den Grundsätzen des Datenschutz-Rahmens vereinbar ist, sofern HubSpot nicht für das Ereignis, das den Schaden verursacht hat, verantwortlich ist.
Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir unter bestimmten Umständen verpflichtet sein können, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auf rechtmäßige Anfragen von Behörden hin offenzulegen, einschließlich der Erfüllung nationaler Sicherheits- oder Strafverfolgungsanforderungen.
5.  WIE WIR PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN SPEICHERN UND SCHÜTZEN
5.1 Datenspeicherung und -sicherheit. Wir verwenden diverse Sicherheitstechnologien und -verfahren, die zum Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten vor unbefugtem Zugriff, unbefugter Nutzung oder Preisgabe beitragen. Wir schützen die personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie auf Computerservern angeben, in einer kontrollierten, sicheren Umgebung. Dort sind diese vor unbefugtem Zugriff, unbefugter Nutzung und Preisgabe geschützt. Alle personenbezogenen Daten werden anhand angemessener physischer, technischer und organisatorischer Maßnahmen geschützt. Weitere Informationen zum Thema Sicherheit bei HubSpot finden Sie unter
https://trust.hubspot.com
.
5.2 Speicherung personenbezogener Daten. Wie lange wir die zu Ihnen erhobenen Daten speichern, hängt sowohl von der Art der Informationen ab als auch davon, wie wir sie erfassen und speichern. Nach einem angemessenen Zeitraum löschen oder anonymisieren wir die Daten. Sollte beides nicht möglich sein, werden die Daten von uns sicher gespeichert und so lange für jede weitere Nutzung gesperrt, bis ihre Löschung möglich ist.
Wir speichern personenbezogene Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen, so lange, wie unsererseits ein legitimes geschäftliches Interesse fortbesteht (etwa um unsere gesetzlichen Pflichten zu erfüllen, Streitigkeiten beizulegen und unsere vertraglichen Ansprüche durchzusetzen).
Wenn unsererseits kein legitimes geschäftliches Interesse an der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten fortbesteht, löschen oder anonymisieren wir diese Daten auf sichere Weise. Ist beides nicht möglich, speichern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten so lange auf sichere Weise und schließen sie von jeder weiteren Datenverarbeitung aus, bis die Löschung möglich ist. Wenn Sie uns dazu auffordern, löschen wir diese Daten zu einem früheren Datum. Nähere Informationen hierzu finden Sie im Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“.
Wenn Sie sich dafür entschlossen haben, Marketingmitteilungen von uns zu erhalten, speichern wir ab dem Datum, zu dem Sie Ihr Interesse an unseren Inhalten, Produkten oder Leistungen zum letzten Mal zum Ausdruck gebracht haben, für einen angemessenen Zeitraum Informationen zu Ihren Marketingpräferenzen. Besagter angemessener Zeitraum wird zum Beispiel ab dem Zeitpunkt bestimmt, zu dem Sie zuletzt eine unserer E-Mails geöffnet haben, oder ab dem Zeitpunkt, zu dem Sie die Nutzung Ihres HubSpot-Accounts eingestellt haben.  Wir speichern die über Cookies oder andere Tracking-Technologien erhobenen Daten für einen angemessenen Zeitraum ab der Erfassung der betreffenden Daten.
Die Daten, die wir im Namen von Kunden im Zusammenhang mit dem Abonnementdienst verarbeiten, werden gemäß den
HubSpot-Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
und der
Datenverarbeitungsvereinbarung
des Kunden gespeichert und geschützt.
6. COOKIES UND ÄHNLICHE TECHNOLOGIEN
6.1 Cookies. Wenn Sie unsere Websites besuchen, einen HubSpot-Account eröffnen, an einem virtuellen HubSpot-Event teilnehmen oder weitere Informationen über HubSpot anfordern, erfassen wir automatisch Daten mithilfe von Trackingtechnologien wie Cookies und Trackingpixeln.

HubSpot-Cookie-Richtlinie
, die von uns von Zeit zu Zeit ohne zusätzliche Ankündigung aktualisiert wird.
6.2 Werbung. Wir arbeiten mit externen Werbenetzwerken zusammen, um Anzeigen auf unserer Website anzuzeigen oder unsere Werbung auf anderen Websites zu verwalten. Unser externes Werbenetzwerk verwendet Cookies und Web-Beacons zur Erfassung von Informationen über Ihre Aktivitäten auf dieser und anderen Websites. Dies dient dazu, Ihnen gezielt Anzeigen zu zeigen, die Ihren Interessen entsprechen.  Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass diese Daten genutzt werden, um Ihnen gezielte Werbeanzeigen zu liefern, können Sie diese Option hier mit einem Klick abbestellen:

HubSpot handelt in den meisten Fällen als Auftragsverarbeiter für unsere Kunden und wir unterstützen diese dabei, solchen Anfragen gegebenenfalls nachzukommen.
7.2 Anti-Spam-Richtlinie. Unsere
Richtlinie zur akzeptablen Nutzung
gilt für uns und unsere Kunden. Sie verbietet unter anderem die Nutzung des Abonnementdienstes für den Versand unerwünschter gewerblicher E-Mails, soweit dies gegen geltendes Recht verstößt, und sie schreibt vor, dass alle über den Abonnementdienst versendeten E-Mails einen „Opt-out“-Mechanismus und weitere obligatorische Informationen enthalten müssen. Wir verlangen von allen unseren Kunden, dass sie sich uneingeschränkt zur Einhaltung der Richtlinie zur akzeptablen Nutzung verpflichten.

8. RECHT AUF PRIVATSPHÄRE NACH KALIFORNISCHEM RECHT
8.1 Anwendbarkeit. Dieser Abschnitt gilt nur für Verbraucher in Kalifornien. Im Rahmen dieses Abschnitts bezieht sich der Begriff „Persönliche Daten“ auf die ihm im California Consumer Privacy Act („CCPA“) zugeschriebene Bedeutung. In diesem Abschnitt wird beschrieben, wie wir in unserer Rolle als Unternehmen persönliche Daten von Verbrauchern in Kalifornien sammeln, nutzen und teilen und welche Rechte für Einwohner Kaliforniens gelten.
Falls Sie aufgrund einer Behinderung oder einer körperlichen oder geistigen Beeinträchtigung nicht in der Lage sind, auf diese Datenschutzrichtlinie zuzugreifen, können Sie uns kontaktieren und wir veranlassen, dass Sie die benötigten Informationen in einem alternativen, für Sie zugänglichen Format erhalten.
8.2 Wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten sammeln, verwenden und weitergeben. Innerhalb der letzten zwölf (12) Monate haben wir die folgenden gesetzlichen Kategorien für persönliche Daten zusammengestellt:
(i) Kennungen wie Name, E-Mail-Adresse, Postanschrift und Telefonnummer. Wir erhalten diese Daten direkt von Ihnen oder über externe Quellen.
(ii) Geschäftsinformationen wie Einträge zu Abonnements. Wir erhalten diese Daten direkt von Ihnen.
(iii) Internet- oder Netzwerkinformationen wie den Browser- und Suchverlauf. Wir erhalten diese Daten direkt über Ihr Gerät.
(iv) Daten zur Geo-Positionierung wie die IP-Adresse. Wir erhalten diese Daten über Ihr Gerät.
(v) Finanzinformationen wie Zahlungsdaten oder Daten von Bankkonten, die im Laufe der Einrichtung Ihres Abonnements eingesetzt wurden. Wir erhalten diese Daten von Ihnen.
(vi) Berufliche Daten, wie Ihre Berufsbezeichnung und Ihr Unternehmen.
(vii) Andere persönliche Daten, z. B. wenn Sie mit uns online, per Telefon oder über E-Mail kommunizieren, um Hilfe durch unsere Helpdesks oder andere Supportkanäle zu erhalten; oder wenn Sie an Kundenumfragen oder Wettbewerben teilnehmen; oder bei der Einrichtung des Abonnementdienstes.
(viii) Folgerungen, die aus einer der oben genannten Kategorien gezogen werden, allein oder in Kombination.
In dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie wird beschrieben, für welche geschäftlichen und gewerblichen Zwecke wir diese Daten sammeln. Die Kategorien von Dritten, an die wir diese Informationen für einen geschäftlichen Zweck „weitergeben“, sind im Abschnitt „Wie wir personenbezogene Daten teilen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschrieben. Der Zeitraum, für den wir diese Daten aufbewahren, wird im Abschnitt „Wie wir personenbezogene Daten speichern und schützen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschrieben.
In den vorangegangenen 12 Monaten haben wir bestimmte Informationen, einschließlich Kennungen, an unsere Werbepartner „verkauft“ oder „weitergegeben“ (wie im CCPA definiert). Wir haben auch bestimmte Informationen, einschließlich Identifikatoren, ungefähre Standortdaten und berufliche Daten an unsere Kunden „verkauft“ oder „weitergegeben“.
8.3 Ihre Rechte als Einwohner Kaliforniens. Ihnen stehen bestimmte Rechte bezüglich der persönlichen Daten, die wir über Sie sammeln oder speichern, zu. Bitte beachten Sie, dass es sich hierbei um keine absoluten Rechte handelt, und es kann zu Fällen kommen, in denen wir Ihre Anfrage, soweit gesetzlich zulässig, ablehnen. Diese Rechte umfassen:
(i) Das Recht auf Auskunft bedeutet, dass Sie das Recht haben, uns aufzufordern, Ihnen mitzuteilen, welche personenbezogenen Daten wir in den letzten 12 Monaten über Sie gesammelt und gespeichert haben.
(ii) Das Recht auf Löschung bedeutet, dass Sie das Recht haben, uns dazu aufzufordern, von uns gesammelte und gespeicherte personenbezogene Daten über Sie zu löschen – von Ausnahmen abgesehen.
(iii) Das Recht auf Berichtigung bedeutet, dass Sie das Recht haben, die Korrektur von fehlerhaften persönlichen Daten anzufordern, die wir über Sie gespeichert haben.
(iv) Das Recht, Informationen über die Kategorien personenbezogener Daten (falls vorhanden) anzufordern, die wir an Dritte oder Affiliate-Partner für deren Direktmarketingzwecke weitergeben.
(v) Das Recht, die Verwendung sensibler personenbezogener Daten einzuschränken, bedeutet, dass Sie das Recht haben, Unternehmen anzuweisen, Ihre sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten nur für begrenzte Zwecke zu verwenden. Wir erfassen sensible personenbezogene Daten (wie z. B. Ihre Zahlungsinformationen), wie in den geltenden Gesetzen definiert, nur für die gesetzlich zulässigen Zwecke oder mit Ihrer Zustimmung. Wir sammeln und verarbeiten keine sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten, um Rückschlüsse auf Ihre Person zu ziehen.
(vi) Das Recht auf Widerspruch bedeutet, dass Sie gegen jede Entscheidung von uns, Ihre Datenschutzrechte nach geltendem Recht zu verweigern, Widerspruch einlegen können.
(vii) Das Recht darauf, nicht diskriminiert zu werden, bedeutet, dass Sie nicht diskriminierend behandelt werden, wenn Sie von einem Ihrer Datenschutzrechte Gebrauch machen.
Wir beantworten alle Einspruchsanfragen so schnell wie möglich, jedoch nicht später als gesetzlich vorgeschrieben.
8.4 So machen Sie als Einwohner Kaliforniens von Ihren Rechten Gebrauch. Sie können entweder selbst von diesen Rechten Gebrauch machen oder alternativ einen Handlungsbevollmächtigten bestimmen, der in Ihrem Namen von diesen Rechten Gebrauch macht. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir zum Schutz Ihrer persönlichen Daten Ihre Identität mit einer solchen Methode verifizieren, die der Art Ihrer Anfrage angemessen ist. Je nach Anfrage werden wir Sie um Daten wie Ihren Namen und Ihre E-Mail-Adresse bitten. Wir können Sie außerdem dazu auffordern, sicherzustellen, dass Ihr Handlungsbevollmächtigter von Ihnen eine schriftliche Genehmigung dafür erhält, in Ihrem Namen zu handeln. Zum Schutz Ihrer persönlichen Daten müssen wir möglicherweise darüber hinaus die Identität Ihres Handlungsbevollmächtigten verifizieren. Wir können den Antrag eines Vertreters ablehnen, der nicht nachweist, dass er berechtigt ist, in Ihrem Namen zu handeln.
Wir werden innerhalb des gesetzlich zulässigen Zeitrahmens antworten. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir für mehrere Anfragen innerhalb desselben 12-Monats-Zeitraums eine angemessene Gebühr erheben können, soweit dies gesetzlich zulässig ist.
Bitte wenden Sie sich unter den unten stehenden Kontaktdaten an uns oder konsultieren Sie Abschnitt „Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten in Bezug auf Datenschutz“, wenn Sie:
(i) in einem alternativen Format auf diese Richtlinie zugreifen möchten;
(ii) eines Ihrer oben beschriebenen Rechte ausüben möchten;
(iii) mehr über Ihre Rechte oder unsere Datenschutzpraktiken erfahren möchten; oder
(iv) einen Handlungsbevollmächtigten bestimmten möchten, der in Ihrem Namen eine Anfrage stellt.
8.5 Recht auf Ablehnung des „Verkaufs“ oder der „Weitergabe“. HubSpot sammelt Daten aus öffentlich zugänglichen Quellen oder anderen Drittquellen und gibt diese Informationen an unsere Kunden weiter, die unsere Anreicherungsprodukte kaufen. Dies kann unter bestimmten staatlichen Datenschutzgesetzen wie dem CCPA als „Verkauf“ oder „Weitergabe“ angesehen werden. Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Abschnitt „Daten, die wir in Verbindung mit unseren Anreicherungsprodukten sammeln und verarbeiten“.
Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, wie im CCPA definiert, auch an dritte Werbepartner weitergeben, um im Namen von HubSpot personalisierte Werbung auf den Websites oder mobilen Apps anderer Unternehmen zu schalten. Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Abschnitt „Werbepartner“.
Wenn Sie möchten, dass Ihre Daten aus unserem kommerziellen Datensatz entfernt werden, oder wenn Sie der Weitergabe Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten für unsere Werbe- und Marketingaktivitäten widersprechen möchten, füllen Sie bitte
dieses Formular
aus.
Sie können auch die personalisierte Werbung, die Sie sehen, kontrollieren, indem Sie diese Dienste nutzen:
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
oder
https://optout.aboutads.info
/ (oder wenn Sie sich in der Europäischen Union befinden, klicken Sie bitte hier:

). Bitte beachten Sie, dass Sie damit nicht verhindern, dass Ihnen weiterhin Werbung angezeigt wird. Sie sehen dann generische Werbeanzeigen.
Wir „verkaufen“ oder „teilen“ nicht wissentlich personenbezogene Daten von Kindern unter 16 Jahren.
9. SONSTIGE WICHTIGE INFORMATIONEN ZUM DATENSCHUTZ
9.1 Daten von Kindern. Die HubSpot-Websites, Produkte und Dienstleistungen sind nicht für Kinder unter 16 Jahren gedacht, und wir erfassen weder wissentlich noch absichtlich personenbezogene Daten über Kinder unter 16 Jahren. Wenn Sie mutmaßen, dass wir personenbezogene Daten eines Kindes unter 16 Jahren erfasst haben, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte
hier
, damit wir die Daten löschen können.
9.1.1 Daten von Kindern im Abonnementdienst. Unser Produkt oder der Abonnementdienst ermöglicht es unseren Kunden, Daten von Kinder zu erfassen, die in den Kundendaten enthalten sein können, gemäß unseren
Nutzungsbedingungen für Kunden
. Mehr Informationen darüber, wie wir als Auftragsverarbeiter Daten im Namen unserer Kunden verarbeiten, finden Sie im Unterabschnitt „Daten, die wir im Namen von Kunden verarbeiten, wenn diese den Abonnementdienst nutzen“ dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie.
9.2 Externe Schlichtungsstelle. Wenn Sie ein ungelöstes Anliegen bezüglich des Datenschutzes oder der Verwendung Ihrer Daten haben, wenden Sie sich bitte (gebührenfrei) an unseren externen Schlichter in den USA unter
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
(auf Englisch).
10.  GOOGLE-PRODUKTE UND INTEGRATIONEN
10.1 Google reCAPTCHA. Zum Schutz vor Schadsoftware, die auf unseren Websites missbräuchliche Aktivitäten durchführen könnte, haben wir Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in einigen unserer Produkte und Services implementiert. Mehr über die Art der von Google erfassten Daten und deren Verwendungszwecke erfahren Sie in der
Datenschutzrichtlinie von Google
. Weitere Informationen zu den Produkten und Dienstleistungen von Google sind in den
Nutzungsbedingungen von Google
abrufbar.
10.2 Gmail-Integration. Wenn Sie die Gmail-Integration verwenden oder eine andere Google Workspace-Anwendung in HubSpot integrieren möchten, werden Sie aufgefordert, uns Zugriff auf Daten in Ihrem Gmail- oder Google-Konto zu gewähren.
Durch Ihre Verwendung der Gmail-Integration mit dem Abonnementdienst geben Sie dem Abonnementdienst Zugriff auf mit Ihrem Gmail-Konto verknüpfte Daten, darunter Kontakte, E-Mails, Kalender, Verteilerlisten, Betreffzeilen und URLs von Tracking-Links in Ihren E-Mails (sofern Sie die Funktion zum E-Mail-Tracking verwenden). Darüber hinaus kann der Abonnementdienst E-Mails aus Ihrem verknüpften Gmail-Konto lesen, bearbeiten, erstellen und versenden. Der Abonnementdienst überprüft den Inhalt Ihrer E-Mails, um zu ermitteln, für welche E-Mails Sie die Trackingfunktion aktiviert haben, und so die Benachrichtigungsfunktion für Sie bereitzustellen. Der Abonnementdienst speichert Antworten, ausgehende Nachrichten, E-Mail-Header, Betreffzeilen, Verteilerlisten, Aliasse, Versandzeiten und E-Mail-Texte. Ihr E-Mail-Verkehr kann unter Umständen sensible, private oder vertrauliche Informationen wie Kontaktnamen, private Nachrichten, Finanz- oder Gesundheitsdaten enthalten. Sie sind sich darüber im Klaren, dass die getrackten Korrespondenzen für andere Nutzer in Ihrem Abonnement-Team sichtbar sind. Google Workspace-APIs werden nicht verwendet, um verallgemeinerte KI- und/oder ML-Modelle zu entwickeln, zu verbessern oder zu trainieren.
Wenn Sie Ihr Gmail-Konto via IMAP (oder direkt über Google) mit dem Abonnementdienst verknüpfen, hat der Abonnementdienst ausschließlich Zugriff auf E-Mail-Adressen, Passwörter, Server-Informationen, E-Mail-Meta-Daten und E-Mail-Texte. Für die Verknüpfung Ihres Gmail-Kontos via IMAP müssen Sie keine anderen Google Workspace-Anwendungen mit HubSpot verknüpfen.
Tipp zu HubSpots Vertragsbedingungen: Mehr darüber, wie wir auf diese Daten zugreifen, erfahren Sie in folgendem Artikel der Wissensdatenbank:
Persönliche E-Mail-Konten mit HubSpot verknüpfen
.
10.3 Zusätzliche Einschränkungen der Nutzung Ihrer Google-Nutzerdaten. Die Nutzung von Informationen, die HubSpot von Google-APIs erhält, sowie deren Übertragung an eine andere App erfolgt gemäß der
Google API Services User Data Policy
, was die Anforderungen zur eingeschränkten Nutzung einschließt.
10.4 Google Kalender-Integration. Der Abonnementdienst hat Zugriff auf Ihren Google Kalender und auf jeden anderen Ihrer mit Google verknüpften Kalender, um Ihre Nutzung unseres Meetings-Tools zu unterstützen und um Ihnen zu ermöglichen, Events mit Kontakten in Ihrem HubSpot-Account zu verbinden. Der Abonnementdienst kann Ihre Kalender erstellen und ändern und einzelne Kalender-Events aktualisieren.
10.5 Google Drive-Integration. Durch die Verknüpfung mit Google Drive kann der Abonnementdienst Ihre Dateien aufrufen, hochladen und herunterladen sowie Dateiinhalte und -titel speichern. Der Abonnementdienst nutzt diese Berechtigungen, um Ihre Verwendung der Funktionen des Composer- und des Collect-Tools zu unterstützen, damit Sie Entwürfe für Blogartikel in Google Drive erstellen und anschließend für die Veröffentlichung hochladen können.
10.6 Google Search Console-Integration. Sie haben die Möglichkeit, Ihre Google Search Console mit unserem Content-Management-System (CMS) und Marketing Hub zu integrieren. Im Rahmen dieser Integration kann der Abonnementdienst Eigenschaften aufrufen, verwalten und speichern, welche die Liste der Websites und Domains, die Sie in HubSpot kontrollieren, und die Search Console-Daten für Ihre verbundenen Eigenschaften umfassen.
10.7 Chrome-Erweiterungen.
10.7.1 HubSpot-Browsererweiterung. Sie können die HubSpot-Browser-Erweiterung für Chrome installieren, um E-Mails aus Gmail und Google Workspace im Chrome-Browser nachzuverfolgen. Sobald die Erweiterung installiert ist, kann sie alle Ihre Daten auf den von Ihnen besuchten Websites lesen und ändern sowie Benachrichtigungen anzeigen. Die Erweiterung speichert alle E-Mails aus Gmail und kann in Verbindung mit der Inbox-Integration verwendet werden.
10.7.2 Collect-Erweiterung. Sie können die Collect-Erweiterung mit Ihrem Google Drive integrieren, um Dateien und Text direkt aus Ihrem Chrome-Browser in Google Drive hochzuladen. Diese Dateien stehen Ihnen anschließend über die Google Drive-Integration zur Verfügung.
10.7.3 Social-Media-Erweiterung. Sie können die Social-Media-Erweiterung für Chrome mit dem Social Composer Tool von HubSpot nutzen, um Seiten, Texte und Bilder aus dem Netz mit anderen Nutzern zu teilen. Sie können Beiträge verfassen und planen, Kampagnen zuweisen sowie Beiträge im Social-Media-Kalender oder – sobald sie veröffentlicht wurden – in Social-Media-Berichten ansehen.
Tipp zu HubSpots Vertragsbedingungen: Die Social-Media-Erweiterung greift erst auf Informationen über die aktuelle Seite zu, nachdem die entsprechende Schaltfläche auf der Symbolleiste angeklickt wurde. Dabei werden die in dem Wissensdatenbankartikel
Installieren und Nutzen der Social Chrome-Erweiterung von HubSpot
erteilten Genehmigungen beachtet.
10.8. YouTube-Integration. Wenn Sie HubSpot-Kunde sind und die YouTube-Integration mit Ihren Abonnementdiensten von HubSpot nutzen möchten, werden Sie aufgefordert, uns Zugriff auf die Daten Ihres YouTube-Kontos zu gewähren, und erhalten die Möglichkeit, Ihre Konten zu verknüpfen.
Durch Ihre Verwendung der YouTube-Integration mit dem Abonnementdienst erteilen Sie dem Abonnementdienst von HubSpot Zugriff auf mit Ihrem YouTube-Konto verknüpfte Daten. Der Abonnementdienst überprüft den Inhalt Ihres YouTube-Kontos, um zu ermitteln, für welche Inhalte Sie die Trackingfunktion aktiviert haben, und so Funktionen der Abonnementdienste für Sie bereitzustellen. Der Abonnementdienst speichert Informationen aus Ihrem YouTube-Konto. Sie nehmen zur Kenntnis, dass die Informationen aus Ihrem YouTube-Konto, die Sie in den Abonnementdiensten verfolgen, für andere Benutzer innerhalb Ihres HubSpot-Accounts sichtbar sein können.
Ihre Nutzung der YouTube-Integration von HubSpot unterliegt den Nutzungsbedingungen von YouTube unter
https://www.youtube.com/t/terms
und der Datenschutzrichtlinie von Google unter
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de
.
Zusätzlich zu den typischen Funktionen zur Datenlöschung, die in den Abonnementdiensten unterstützt werden, können Kunden die YouTube-Integration in Ihrem HubSpot-Account in den Google-Sicherheitseinstellungen unter
https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions
widerrufen.
Tipp zu den HubSpot-Vertragsbedingungen: Weitere Informationen über unseren Zugriff auf Informationen und das Entfernen des Zugriffs auf Ihr Google-Konto finden Sie in folgendem Artikel der Wissensdatenbank:
Entfernen Sie den Zugriff auf HubSpot in Ihrem Google-Konto

2. Users
2.1 Information We Collect from Users (“User Information”)
We automatically collect User Information when Users interact with our Services that appear on our Customers’ websites and digital properties. Like most other web-based services, we collect this User Information through cookies and other technologies. Taboola collects only pseudonymized data, which means we do not know who you are because we do not know or process your name, email address, or other identifiable data. Instead, we only process digital identifiers such as cookie IDs, IP addresses, mobile advertising IDs on your device, Taboola network browsing history and associated preferences, and in some limited circumstances, your hashed email address.
User Information that we collect includes, but is not limited to the following:
Content Discovery Platform
: We collect Information about a User’s device and operating system, IP address, the web pages accessed by Users within our Customers’ websites, the link that led a User to a Customer’s website, the dates and times a User accesses a Customers’ website, event information (e.g., system crashes), Information about the interactions with advertisements and Customers’ Services (e.g., availability, visibility, and clicks), general location information (e.g., city and state), hashed email addresses (when made available by the User), and gender (when made available by the User).

Cookie Policy
.

2.2 Why We Use User Information
We use User Information for the following purposes:
Providing and Improving our Service
. We may use User Information to provide and improve our Services to Users and our Customers.
Tailoring content
. We may use User Information to tailor the content and information that we may send or display to Users; to retarget content to Users through our Services and elsewhere; and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using our Services. For more information about how we tailor our content see information below about our
Interest Based Advertising
.
Tailoring content across multiple devices
. We may use User Information to improve a unique User’s experience across multiple browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or other viewing devices) by providing better targeted ad campaigns to that User. For instance, should we recognize a User on a web browser, we may want to provide that User similar or personalized content on mobile apps, as well. To do this, we identify unique Users across devices, or we may sync cookies and identifiers with our service providers or Customers that do this, to help our Customers enhance their own data and data segments, or to help them target the right audience.
Offering our Customers data segments that help target content and advertisements for topics, products, and services that may interest you.
A data segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g., travel enthusiasts). We offer a number of data segments, both proprietary and from our
data partners
, to our Customers so that they may better target Users who are more likely to be interested in their content and advertisements. Taboola does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, Personal Data revealing your racial or ethnic origin or your religious affiliations, or Personal Data concerning your sensitive health information, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data). In connection with our Services, our Customers may use these
standard health-related segments
about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or over the counter medications. In addition, Taboola offers our Customers
standard political-related segments
that may indicate general political sentiment, interest in specific political issues, and political party affiliation.
2.3 To Whom We Disclose User Information
We may disclose User Information as follows:
Taboola Affiliates
. We may disclose User Information to any current or future Affiliates, parent companies, or subsidiaries to process for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Taboola service providers

Unaffiliated third parties
. We may disclose User Information to other unaffiliated third parties, specifically with (i) our
data partners
, so that we can connect you with relevant content by allowing our advertisers to target specific audience segments, and (ii) our
programmatic demand and supply partners
, so that we can serve you with tailored advertisements.
Customers
. We may disclose User Information to Customers where relevant to the Service we provide those Customers. For example, we may provide publishers with information about the viewing and click-through patterns of the content they publish and may provide advertisers with information about conversion rates for analytics purposes.

2.5 Interest-Based Advertising
Through our Services, including our Services on Customer websites, we may provide advertisements to you based on your recent browsing behavior across different Customer websites, browsers, or devices. For example, if on a first online visit, you browse on website A, then on a subsequent visit to website B, you may see content personalized based on your browsing history on website A. For example, if a user visits a clothing retail site, she might see clothing-related ads on another site she visits.
In order to target advertisements to you for products and services that may interest you, we may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other technologies. For more information about how we use these technologies, please refer to our
Cookie Policy
.
We may also work with third parties such as ad networks, which are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to websites that you have visited in the past. These advertisers will deliver you targeted advertisements for products and services that may interest you. Third-party ad networks, our advertiser Customers (and their content providers and agents), and/or traffic measurement services may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These
third-party cookies and other technologies
are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.
If you have questions about our collection and use of data for interest-based advertising purposes, please contact us at:
support@taboola.com
.
2.6 Opt Out
Taboola supports initiatives to offer our Users greater transparency and control over the uses of their Information. Therefore, we offer the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive.
If
you do not want to receive interest-based ads from Taboola, you can disable the display of such ads by clicking on the opt-out link below
. Please note that an opt out will not prevent you from seeing Taboola’s content recommendations. Rather, the opt out will prevent Taboola from using your Information to tailor these recommendations to your interests. You will continue to receive recommendations that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
You are currently:
Opted Out
Opt In
Not Opted Out
Opt Out
Not Opted Out
: Taboola will serve you personalized recommendations based on your history.
Opted Out
: You have opted out of tracking, Taboola will no longer serve you with personalized content recommendations based on your Internet use history.
Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices,
you will need to do so on each device and browser individually
. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies, your opt-out may not be effective, since we identify your choice to opt-out based on an opt-out cookie we deliver to you. In this case, you will need to confirm that your browser is configured properly in order for the opt-out to be effective. If you are using a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra, you must first adjust your Privacy and Security Settings to turn off both “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking” and “Block All Cookies”, and then return to this privacy policy or your preferred opt out platform to reset your opt out preferences.
Taboola may use non-cookie technologies in limited cases. Like cookies, these technologies allow Taboola to recommend ads that are tailored to your interests and to remember whether you have chosen to opt-out from our Services. Please note that some web browsers may not permit you to block the use of non-cookie technologies, but you can do so by simply clicking on the Opt Out feature above in this Section 2.6.
You can also opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by Taboola and other advertising companies
.
You may use the
NAI opt out tool
, which will allow you to opt out of receiving targeted ads from Taboola and from other NAI-approved member companies. The NAI also provides instructions to engage system-level mobile device opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments.
You may also visit one of the Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites to learn more about User choices and opting out of interest-based advertising displayed by the many member companies.
Users in the United States may visit the DAA consumer choice page at
www.aboutads.info/choices
Users in Canada may visit the DAAC consumer choice page at
www.youradchoices.ca/choices
Users in Europe (including the United Kingdom) may visit the EDAA consumer choice page at
www.youronlinechoices.eu
You can also opt out of the use of your email address for targeted ads through
Audience Matched Advertising
or AMA by Taboola and other advertising companies through the
NAI Audience Matched Advertising Opt Out (Beta)
.
Please note that an opt out from one or more companies listed on the DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages will not prevent you from seeing those companies’ advertisements. Rather, the opt out will prevent these companies from using your Information to display targeted content or ads to you. You may continue to receive advertisements that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will refuse opt-out cookies (that alert companies that you have exercised your opt-out preference).
2.7 Data Retention
We retain User Information, which is directly collected for purposes of serving ads, for at most thirteen (13) months from the User’s last interaction with our Services (often for a shorter period of time), after which time we de-identify the data by removing unique identifiers or aggregating the data.
We retain deidentified or aggregated data, which cannot identify an individual or device and is used for purposes of reporting and analysis, for as long as commercially necessary. We keep opt-out information for longer than this period so that we can continue to honor your opt-out requests.
2.8 Children
We do not knowingly collect any data or target any advertisements on websites directed to children under the age of eighteen (18). If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of eighteen (18) and have a concern regarding the Information we collect, please contact us at

3.4 Third-Party Online Advertising
To understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests, we may work with service providers or third parties that use their own
cookies, web beacons, and other technologies
to collect Information about Site Visitors’ online activities, either on our Sites and/or other websites across the Internet  (“
Taboola Ad Partners
”). These Taboola Ad Partners include advertisers and ad networks that may collect Information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different websites. Like most advertisers, Taboola works to place our advertisements where we think they will be most interesting and relevant to the recipient. One way we do this is by allowing ad networks to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites. This enables the ad network to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Taboola Sites. Then, if the ad network has purchased ad space on a third-party website, and recognizes that same individual visiting that third-party website, the ad network can deliver a Taboola advertisement, knowing that this individual has already expressed interest in Taboola by visiting the Taboola Sites. To learn more about third parties who collect Site Visitor Information, please review our
Cookie Policy
.
3.5 Site Visitor Choices
Site Visitors may opt out of the Taboola Ad Partners that collect information on the Sites to serve ads about Taboola. (Some U.S. Site Visitors may exercise their options directly with Taboola, as outlined below in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.3.1). By visiting one of the Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites, you can learn more about User choices and opting out of interest-based advertising displayed by the many member companies.
Users in the United States may visit the DAA consumer choice page at
www.aboutads.info/choices
Users in Canada may visit the DAAC consumer choice page at
www.youradchoices.ca/choices
Users in Europe (including the United Kingdom) may visit the EDAA consumer choice page at
www.youronlinechoices.eu
Please note that an opt out from one or more companies listed on the DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages will not prevent you from seeing those companies’ advertisements. Rather, the opt out will prevent these companies from using your Information to display targeted content or ads to you. You may continue to receive advertisements that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will refuse opt-out cookies (that alert companies that you have exercised your opt-out preference).

5.1.4 EEA/UK Data Transfers
As part of Taboola’s global operations, our data flows among the EEA, the UK, Israel, the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong, and Taboola stores Customer, User, and Visitor information in our data centers located in Israel and the United States.
When Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to Taboola.com Ltd. in Israel, it relies (as applicable) on (i) the European Commission’s decision, and (ii) UK adequacy regulations that Israel provides a level of data protection that is adequate for EEA/UK Data. These allow the free transfer of EEA/UK Data to Israel without the need for additional data transfer mechanisms.
Similarly, when Taboola transfers any personal data from the EEA to Taboola Europe Limited in the United Kingdom, it relies on the European Commission’s decision that the UK provides a level of data protection that is adequate for personal data from the EEA.
Beyond that, when Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to other countries then, if those countries do not have a European Commission adequacy finding and are not the subject of UK adequacy regulations (as applicable), Taboola implements
Standard Contractual Clauses
approved by the European Commission and/or competent UK authorities (as applicable) to protect the transferred data. The Standard Contractual Clauses are contractual privacy and security commitments that are entered between companies that transfer personal data outside of the EEA.
In particular, non-EEA/UK Taboola Affiliates, like Taboola, Inc. in the United States, have accordingly adopted Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure the legality, privacy, and security of the data flows necessary to provide, maintain, and develop our services.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information about you, the purposes for which we process personal information about you and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL DATA
It is the policy of Defiant and its subsidiaries to protect users’ information both online and off-line. Access to our users’ information is restricted to only those employees or agents, contractors or subcontractors of Defiant who have valid reasons to access this information to perform any service you have requested or authorized, or for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy.
The information you provide will not be sold, rented, or shared for cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes to third parties.
We may provide personal information to:
Defiant-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries, located in and outside your country, including outside the European Union or United Kingdom (in such case, we will use an appropriate legal framework to operate data transfers);
outsourced service providers who perform functions on our behalf, located inside or outside of the EU or UK territory (in such case, we will use appropriate legal framework to operate data transfers). For example, when you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction;
our authorized agents and representatives, located inside or outside of the EU or UK territory (in such case, we will use appropriate legal framework to operate data transfers), who sell products or provide services on our behalf, such as training service providers or product resellers;
anyone expressly authorized by you to receive personal information about you;
anyone to whom we are required by law to disclose personal information, upon valid and enforceable request thereof.
Finally, we will access, disclose and preserve personal information when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:
comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal processes, including from law enforcement or other government agencies, upon valid and enforceable request thereof; or
operate and maintain the security of our Services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.
In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information to service providers for a business purpose:
Identifiers, for Payment processing, marketing, delivery services, customer relationship management, web hosting, or data storage

Internet or other similar network activity, for marketing, delivery services, customer relationship management, web hosting, or data storage

If you provide personal information to any of those services, your data is governed by their privacy statements or policies. Defiant. Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other Sites. Please review the privacy policies for these websites to understand how they process your information.
We require service providers to only use personal information for the specific purpose for which it was given to us and to protect the privacy of personal information. We will only disclose personal information about you to service providers who agree to keep your information confidential.
HANDLING OF PERSONAL DATA

We also may include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them as well as for statistical purposes.

All Cookies are browser specific. Therefore, if you use multiple browsers or devices to access websites, you will need to manage your cookie preferences across these environments.
If you are using a mobile device to access the Sites, you will need to refer to your instruction manual or other help/settings resource to find out how you can control cookies on your device.
Please note: If you restrict, disable or block any or all Cookies from your web browser or mobile or other device, the Sites may not operate properly, and you may not have access to the Services available through the Sites.

Do Not Track: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including Defiant, do not respond to DNT signals.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
THE SITES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN
You must be at least the age of majority in your place of residence to use the Sites or Services. The Sites or Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors. Consistent with the requirements of the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, if we learn that we received any information directly from a child under age 13 without his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to inform the child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) that he or she cannot use the Sites or Services.
California Minors: While the Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 18, if you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: privacy@defiant.com.

We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don’t follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the Content or information. Removal of your content or information from the Service does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.

2.1 Services
Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
Stay Connected
Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their
settings
, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can
choose
whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
Visitors have
choices
about how we use their data.
Stay Informed
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were
mentioned in the news
.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
interested
in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your
settings
allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.

at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.
We also enable
communications

invitations
,
InMail
,
groups
and
messages
between connections.
2.4 Advertising
We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn
tag
on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,
groups
participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising
partners
, vendors and
publishers
; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).
Learn more
about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
Learn more
about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our
European Regional Privacy Notice
.
We will show you ads called
sponsored content
which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
Ad Choices
You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings
can be found here
. For Visitors,
the setting is here
.
Info to Ad Providers
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
2.5 Marketing
We promote our Services to you and others.
In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
2.6 Developing Services and Research
We develop our Services and conduct research
Service Development
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct
research
and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
Other Research
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these
jobs
and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under
controls
that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to
researchers
to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
Surveys
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may
opt-out
of survey invitations.
2.7 Customer Support
We use data to help you and fix problems.
We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
We use your
data
to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your
settings
, for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a
post
or LinkedIn
Page
, to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
2.9 Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our
User Agreement
and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
Social Action
E.g. like, comment, follow, share
Partners
Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services
Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
Profile
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a
group
, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your
settings
.
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your
settings
where applicable.
Subject to your
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you
choices
about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
Enterprise Accounts
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
Subject to your
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
3.2 Communication Archival
Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
3.3 Others’ Services
You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
Subject to your
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may
revoke
the link with such accounts.
The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages)
may be available to them on other services
. For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your
settings
), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
3.4 Related Services
We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services.
Where allowed
, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
3.5 Service Providers
We may use others to help us with our Services.
We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
3.6 Legal Disclosures
We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our
Data Request Guidelines
and
Transparency Report
.
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
4. Your Choices & Obligations
4.1 Data Retention
We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data
You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.
We provide many
choices
about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your
profile
and controlling the visibility of your
posts
to advertising
opt-outs
and
communication
controls. We offer you
settings
to control and manage the personal data we have about you.
For personal data that we have about you, you can:
Delete Data
: You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data
: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

4.3 Account Closure
We keep some of your data even after you close your account.
If you choose to close your
LinkedIn
account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have
restricted
your account for breach of our
Professional Community Policies
), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache.
5. Other Important Information
5.1. Security
We monitor for and try to prevent security breaches. Please use the security features available through our Services.
We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.

There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Please visit our
Safety Center
for additional information about safely using our Services, including
two-factor authentication

X Datenschutzrichtlinien
Gültig ab: 15. November 2024
Vor dem Scrollen bitte lesen
Es ist wirklich schwer, alle mit einer Datenschutzerklärung zufrieden zu stellen. Die meisten Personen, die X nutzen, wollen etwas Kurzes und leicht Verständliches. Wir wünschten zwar, wir könnten alles, was Sie wissen müssen, in einen Post packen, aber unsere Regulierungsbehörden verlangen von uns, dass wir unseren rechtlichen Verpflichtungen nachkommen und alle Richtlinien sehr detailliert beschreiben.
Aus diesem Grund haben wir unsere Datenschutzrichtlinien so einfach wie möglich formuliert, damit Sie in der Lage sind, informierte Entscheidungen zu treffen, wenn Sie X nutzen. Unser Ziel ist, dass Sie verstehen, welche Daten wir erfassen, wie sie genutzt und wann sie weitergegeben werden, und dass Sie Kontrolle darüber haben.
Wenn Sie also nicht jedes Wort der Datenschutzerklärung lesen, sollten Sie wenigstens Folgendes wissen:

1. Daten, die wir erheben
Die Daten, die wir erheben, wenn Sie X nutzen, lassen sich in drei Kategorien unterteilen.
1.1 Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen.
Zur Nutzung einiger unserer Produkte und Dienste benötigen Sie einen Account, und zur Erstellung eines Accounts müssen Sie uns bestimmte Daten zur Verfügung stellen. Gleichfalls können wir, wenn Sie unsere kostenpflichtigen Produkte und Dienste nutzen, Ihnen diese nicht zur Verfügung stellen, wenn wir Ihre Zahlungsdaten nicht erhalten. Grundsätzlich brauchen wir für viele unserer Produkte und Dienste bestimmte Daten, damit Sie sie nutzen können.
Persönliche Accounts.
Wenn Sie einen Account erstellen, müssen Sie uns einige Daten zur Verfügung stellen, damit wir Ihnen unsere Dienste bereitstellen können. Dazu gehören ein Anzeigename (zum Beispiel „Gestalter*innen“); ein Nutzername (zum Beispiel @XGestalter*innen); ein Passwort; eine E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer; ein Geburtsdatum, Ihre Anzeigesprache und Daten zur einmaligen Anmeldung bei Dritten (wenn Sie diese Anmeldemethode wählen). Sie können sich auch dafür entscheiden, Ihren Standort in Ihrem Profil und in Ihren Posts zu teilen und Ihr Adressbuch auf X hochzuladen, damit Sie leichter nach Personen suchen können, die Sie kennen. Ihre Profildaten, einschließlich Ihres Anzeigenamens und Ihres Nutzernamens, sind immer öffentlich, aber Sie können entweder Ihren echten Namen oder ein Pseudonym verwenden. Denken Sie auch daran, dass Sie mehrere X Accounts einrichten können, zum Beispiel wenn Sie verschiedene Aspekte Ihrer Identität zum Ausdruck bringen möchten, sei es beruflich oder anderweitig.
Professionelle Accounts.
Wenn Sie einen
professionellen Account
einrichten, müssen Sie uns auch eine professionelle Kategorie angeben und können uns weitere Daten zur Verfügung stellen, einschließlich Postanschrift, Kontakt-E-Mail-Adresse und Kontakt-Telefonnummer. Alle diese Daten sind immer öffentlich.
Zahlungsdaten.
Wenn Sie Werbeanzeigen oder andere Angebote kaufen möchten, die im Rahmen unserer kostenpflichtigen Produkte und Dienste zur Verfügung gestellt werden, müssen Sie uns Zahlungsdaten zur Verfügung stellen, einschließlich Ihrer Kredit- oder Debitkartennummer, des Ablaufdatums der Karte, des CVV-Codes und der Rechnungsadresse.
Bevorzugte Einstellungen.
Wenn Sie in Ihren
Einstellungen
bestimmte Präferenzen angeben, erheben wir diese Daten, damit wir Ihre Wünsche berücksichtigen können.
Biometrische Informationen.
Wenn Sie dazu Ihre Einwilligung gegeben haben, können wir Ihre biometrischen Daten zu Sicherheits- und Identifikationszwecken erfassen und verwenden.
Stellenbewerbungen/Empfehlungen.
Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten (z. B. Informationen aus Ihrer Biografie, Ihren beruflichen Werdegang, Ihren Bildungsgang, Ihre Beschäftigungspräferenzen, Fähigkeiten und Fertigkeiten oder Ihre Aktivität und Interaktionen bei der Stellensuche, zusätzlich zu den Informationen, die wir bereits gemäß dem Abschnitt „Daten, die wir erheben, wenn Sie X nutzen“ unserer Datenschutzerklärung weiter unten erfassen) dafür erfassen und heranziehen, Ihnen potenzielle Jobs zu empfehlen, sie an potenzielle Arbeitgeber weiterzuleiten, wenn Sie sich auf eine Stelle bewerben, sodass Arbeitgeber potenzielle Kandidat*innen finden können, und Ihnen relevantere Werbung zu zeigen.
1.2 Daten, die wir erheben, wenn Sie X nutzen.
Wenn Sie unsere Dienste nutzen, erheben wir Daten darüber, wie Sie unsere Produkte und Dienste nutzen. Mithilfe dieser Daten stellen wir Ihnen Produkte und Dienste zur Verfügung und tragen dazu bei, dass X sicherer und respektvoller für alle und relevanter für Sie ist.
Nutzungsinformationen.
Wir erfassen Informationen über Ihre Aktivitäten auf X, darunter:
Von Ihnen gepostete Beiträge und andere Inhalte (einschließlich Datum, Anwendung und Version von X) sowie Informationen zu Ihrer Broadcast-Aktivität (z. B. Spaces), einschließlich von Ihnen erstellter Broadcasts und deren Erstellungszeitpunkt, Ihrer Listen, Lesezeichen und Communities, denen Sie angehören.
Ihre Interaktionen mit den Inhalten anderer Nutzer*innen, wie z. B. Reposts, „Gefällt mir“-Angaben, Lesezeichen, geteilten Inhalten, Downloads, Antworten, wenn andere Nutzer*innen Sie in Inhalten erwähnen oder markieren oder wenn Sie sie erwähnen oder markieren, und Broadcasts, an denen Sie teilgenommen haben (einschließlich Ihres Verlaufs in Bezug auf angesehene/angehörte Inhalte, Kommentare, Sprechbeiträge und Reaktionen).
Wie Sie mit anderen auf der Plattform interagieren, beispielsweise mit Personen, denen Sie folgen, und Personen, die Ihnen folgen, Metadaten in Bezug auf
verschlüsselte Nachrichten
und, wenn Sie
Direktnachrichten
verwenden, auch den Inhalt der Nachrichten, die Empfänger*innen sowie Datum und Uhrzeit der Nachrichten.
Wenn Sie mit uns kommunizieren, beispielsweise per E-Mail, erheben wir Daten über die Kommunikation und deren Inhalt.
Wir erheben Daten über Links, mit denen Sie in unseren Diensten interagieren (auch in den E-Mails, die wir Ihnen schicken).
Käufe und Zahlungen.
Damit Sie unter Verwendung von X-Funktionen oder -Diensten eine Zahlung tätigen oder Geld senden können, auch über einen Vermittler, erhalten wir möglicherweise Informationen zu Ihrer Transaktion, etwa wann sie getätigt wurde, wann ein Abonnement abläuft oder automatisch verlängert wird und welche Beträge gezahlt oder erhalten wurden.
Gerätedaten.
Wir erfassen Informationen von und über die Geräte, die Sie für den Zugriff auf X verwenden, darunter:
Daten über Ihre Verbindung, wie beispielsweise Ihre IP-Adresse, den Browsertyp und verwandte Informationen.
Daten über Ihr Gerät und seine Einstellungen, wie beispielsweise Geräte- und Werbe-ID, Betriebssystem, Anbieter, Sprache, Speicher, installierte Apps und Akkustand.
Das Adressbuch Ihres Geräts, wenn Sie sich dazu entschieden haben, es mit uns zu teilen.
Standortinformationen.
Wenn Sie X verwenden, erfassen wir einige Informationen zu Ihrem ungefähren Standort, um Ihnen den erwarteten Dienst bereitzustellen, einschließlich der Anzeige relevanter Werbung. Sie können auch wählen, ob Sie Ihren aktuellen genauen Standort oder Orte, an denen Sie X zuvor genutzt haben, teilen möchten, indem Sie diese Einstellungen in Ihrem Account aktivieren.
Abgeleitete Identität.
Wir können Informationen sammeln oder erhalten, die wir verwenden, um auf Ihre Identität zu schließen, wie unten beschrieben:
Wenn Sie sich mit einem Browser oder Gerät bei X anmelden, verknüpfen wir diesen Browser oder dieses Gerät mit Ihrem Account. Vorbehaltlich Ihrer Einstellungen können wir Ihren Account auch mit anderen Browsern oder Geräten verknüpfen als mit denen, die Sie für die Anmeldung bei X nutzen (oder Ihr abgemeldetes Gerät oder Ihren Browser mit anderen Browsern oder Geräten oder von X generierten Identifikatoren verknüpfen).
Wenn Sie X andere Daten zur Verfügung stellen, einschließlich einer E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer, verknüpfen wir diese Daten mit Ihrem X Account. Vorbehaltlich Ihrer Einstellungen können wir anhand dieser Daten auch andere Daten über Ihre Identität ableiten, zum Beispiel indem wir Ihren Account mit Hashes von E-Mail-Adressen verknüpfen, die gemeinsame Komponenten mit der E-Mail-Adresse haben, die Sie X zur Verfügung gestellt haben.
Wenn Sie auf X zugreifen und nicht angemeldet sind, können wir anhand der von uns erhobenen Daten Rückschlüsse auf Ihre Identität ziehen.
Protokollinformationen.
Wenn Sie Inhalte auf unseren Produkten und Diensten ansehen oder auf andere Weise mit ihnen interagieren, erhalten wir möglicherweise Informationen, auch wenn Sie keinen Account erstellt haben oder abgemeldet sind, beispielsweise:
IP-Adresse und zugehörige Informationen; Browsertyp und -sprache; Betriebssystem; die verweisende Webseite; Zugriffszeiten; besuchte Seiten; Standort; Ihr Mobilfunkanbieter; Geräteinformationen (einschließlich Geräte- und Anwendungs-IDs); Suchbegriffe und IDs (einschließlich derjenigen, die nicht als Abfragen übermittelt wurden); Ihnen auf X angezeigte Anzeigen; von X generierte Kennungen; und mit Cookies verknüpfte Kennungen. Wir erhalten Protokolldaten auch, wenn Sie auf Links in unseren Diensten klicken, sich diese ansehen oder mit ihnen interagieren, u. a. wenn Sie eine andere Applikation über X installieren.
Werbung.
Wenn Sie Werbung ansehen oder mit ihr interagieren, die wir auf oder außerhalb von X bereitstellen, erfassen wir möglicherweise Informationen zu diesen Ansichten oder Interaktionen (z. B. Ansehen einer Videoanzeige oder eines Prerolls, Anklicken einer Anzeige, Interagieren mit Reposts oder Antworten auf eine Anzeige).
Cookies und ähnliche Technologien.
Wie viele Websites verwenden wir Cookies und ähnliche Technologien, um zusätzliche Daten zur Website-Nutzung zu sammeln und unsere Dienste zu betreiben. Für viele Teile unserer Produkte und Dienste, wie etwa die Suche und Anzeige öffentlicher Profile, sind Cookies nicht erforderlich. Weitere Informationen zur Verwendung von Cookies und ähnlichen Technologien finden Sie
hier
.
Interaktionen mit unseren Inhalten auf Websites Dritter.
Wenn Sie sich unsere Inhalte auf Websites von Dritten ansehen, die X Inhalte wie eingebettete Timelines oder Buttons zum Posten integrieren, können wir Protokolldaten erhalten, einschließlich der von Ihnen besuchten Webseite.
1.3 Daten, die wir von Dritten erhalten.
Wenn Sie andere Online-Produkte und -Dienste nutzen, können sie Daten über diese Nutzung an uns weitergeben.
Werbepartner, Entwickler, Verleger.
Unsere Werbe- und Geschäftspartner geben Daten wie Browser-Cookie-IDs, von X generierte Identifikatoren,
IDs von Mobilgeräten, gehashte Nutzerdaten wie E-Mail-Adressen, demografische Daten oder Interessensdaten sowie auf einer Website oder App angesehene Inhalte oder durchgeführte Aktionen an uns weiter. Einige unserer Werbepartner, insbesondere unsere Werbekunden, ermöglichen es uns auch, ähnliche Daten direkt von ihrer Website oder App zu erheben, indem sie unsere Werbetechnologie integrieren. Daten, die von Werbepartnern und verbundenen Unternehmen weitergegeben oder von X von den Websites und Apps der Werbepartner und verbundenen Unternehmen erhoben werden, können mit den anderen Daten kombiniert werden, die Sie mit X teilen und die X erhält,
generiert oder
über Sie ableitet, wie an anderer Stelle in diesen Datenschutzrichtlinien beschrieben.
Andere Dritte, Account-Verbindungen und Integrationen.
Wir können Daten über Sie von Dritten erhalten, die nicht unsere Werbepartner sind, wie beispielsweise von anderen X Nutzer*innen, Entwickler*innen und Partner*innen, die uns helfen, die Sicherheit und Qualität von Inhalten auf unserer Plattform zu bewerten, von unseren
verbundenen Unternehmen
und von anderen Diensten, die Sie mit Ihrem X Account verknüpfen. Sie können sich entscheiden, Ihren X Account mit Ihrem Account bei einem anderen Dienst zu verbinden und dieser andere Dienst kann uns Daten über Ihren Account bei diesem Dienst senden.
2. Wie wir Daten verwenden
Aufgrund der Funktionsweise der Systeme, die unsere Dienste für Sie anbieten, ist es nicht einfach, die Verwendung der von uns erhobenen Daten aufzuschlüsseln. So kann beispielsweise dieselbe Dateninformation in verschiedener Art und Weise für verschiedene Zwecke verwendet werden, damit letztlich ein einziger Dienst erbracht werden kann. Am zweckdienlichsten ist es wahrscheinlich, die fünf wichtigsten Arten und Weisen zu erläutern, in der wir Daten verwenden. Wenn Sie Fragen haben, die nicht beantwortet werden, können Sie uns jederzeit
kontaktieren
. Mehr im Folgenden:
2.1 Betreiben, Verbessern und Personalisieren unserer Dienste.
Die von uns erhobenen Daten nutzen wir zur Bereitstellung und zum Betrieb der X Produkte und Dienste. Außerdem verbessern und personalisieren wir mit den erhobenen Daten unsere Produkte und Dienste, damit Sie ein besseres Erlebnis auf X haben, u. a. indem wir Ihnen relevantere Inhalte und Werbung zeigen, Ihnen Personen und Themen vorschlagen, denen Sie folgen können, und Ihnen helfen,
verbundene Unternehmen
, Apps von Dritten und Dienste zu entdecken. Wir können die Daten, die wir erheben, und öffentlich verfügbare Daten zum Training unserer Modelle für Maschinenlernen oder künstliche Intelligenz für die in dieser Richtlinie dargelegten Zwecke heranziehen.
Wir können die Daten, die wir von Accounts anderer Dienste erheben, bei denen Sie sich zur Verknüpfung mit Ihrem X Accounts entschieden haben, heranziehen, damit wir Ihnen Funktionen wie dienstübergreifendes Posting oder dienstübergreifende Authentifizierung bieten und unsere Dienste betreiben können.
Anhand Ihrer Kontaktdaten helfen wir anderen, Ihren Account zu finden, wenn Ihre Einstellungen dies zulassen, u. a. über Dienste von Dritten und Client-Applikationen.
Vorbehaltlich Ihrer
Einstellungen
stellen wir mithilfe Ihrer Daten unsere Dienste für Werbung und gesponserte Inhalte bereit, was dabei hilft, die Werbeanzeigen auf X für Sie relevanter zu gestalten. Anhand dieser Daten messen wir auch die Effektivität von Werbeanzeigen und helfen, Ihre Geräte zu erkennen, damit wir Werbeanzeigen auf und außerhalb von X für Sie schalten können. Einige unserer Werbepartner ermöglichen es uns auch, ähnliche Daten direkt von ihrer Website oder App zu erheben, indem sie unsere Werbetechnologie integrieren. Daten, die von Werbepartnern und verbundenen Unternehmen weitergegeben oder von X von den Websites und Apps der Werbepartner und verbundenen Unternehmen erhoben werden, können mit den anderen Daten kombiniert werden, die Sie mit X teilen und die X erhält, generiert oder über Sie ableitet, wie an anderer Stelle in unseren Datenschutzrichtlinien beschrieben.
2.2  Sicherheit und Schutz fördern.
Anhand der von uns erhobenen Daten sorgen wir für den Schutz und die Sicherheit unserer Nutzer*innen, unserer Produkte, unserer Dienste und Ihres Accounts. Dazu gehören die Überprüfung Ihrer Identität, die Authentifizierung Ihres Accounts und die Abwehr von Betrug, unbefugter Nutzung und illegalen Aktivitäten. Außerdem bewerten und beeinflussen wir mithilfe der Daten die Sicherheit und Qualität der Inhalte auf X. Das beinhaltet die Untersuchung und Durchsetzung unserer Richtlinien und AGB sowie des geltenden Rechts.
2.3 Messen, Analysieren und Verbessern unserer Dienst.
Anhand der von uns erhobenen Daten messen und analysieren wir die Effektivität unserer Produkte und Dienste und lernen besser verstehen, wie Sie sie nutzen, damit wir sie weiter verbessern können.
2.4 Kommunikation mit Ihnen über unsere Dienste.
Anhand der von uns erhobenen Daten kommunizieren wir mit Ihnen über unsere Produkte und Dienste, u. a. über Produktaktualisierungen und Änderungen unserer Richtlinien und AGB. Wenn Sie sich dafür entscheiden, können wir Ihnen auch gelegentlich Marketingnachrichten schicken.
2.5 Forschung.
Anhand der Daten, die Sie uns mitteilen oder die wir erheben, führen wir Forschung, Umfragen, Produkttests und Fehlerbehebungen durch, die uns helfen, unsere Produkte und Dienste zu betreiben und zu verbessern.
3. Weitergabe von Daten
Sie sollten wissen, auf welche Weise wir Ihre Daten weitergeben, warum wir sie weitergeben und wie Sie dies beeinflussen können. Es gibt fünf grundsätzliche Möglichkeiten, wie wir Ihre Daten weitergeben.
3.1 Wenn Sie posten und teilen.
An die breite Öffentlichkeit
. Sie weisen uns an, diese Daten so weit wie möglich offenzulegen. Die Inhalte von X, einschließlich Ihrer Profildaten (z. B. Name/Pseudonym, Nutzername, Profilbilder), sind für die breite Öffentlichkeit zur Ansicht zugänglich. Die Öffentlichkeit muss sich nicht anmelden, um einen Teil der Inhalte auf X zu sehen. X Inhalte sind auch außerhalb von X auffindbar, zum Beispiel über die Ergebnisse von Suchanfragen in Internet-Suchmaschinen oder in Videos, die heruntergeladen und anderswo geteilt wurden (abhängig von Ihren
Einstellungen
).
An andere X Nutzer*innen.
Abhängig von Ihren
Einstellungen
und basierend auf den X Produkten und Diensten, die Sie nutzen, geben wir Folgendes weiter:
Ihre Interaktionen mit X-Inhalten anderer Benutzer, z. B. Antworten und Personen, denen Sie folgen.
Inhalte, die Sie an bestimmte X Nutzer*innen senden, wie beispielsweise über
Direktnachrichten
. Zur Beachtung: Wenn Sie Daten wie Direktnachrichten oder geschützte Posts mit einer Person geteilt haben, die über einen Dienst eines Dritten auf X zugreift, können die Daten an den Dienst des Dritten weitergegeben werden.
An Partner.
Abhängig von Ihren
Einstellungen
stellen wir auch bestimmten Dritten Daten zur Verfügung, damit sie uns beim Angebot oder Betrieb unserer Produkte und Dienste unterstützen. In unserem
Hilfe-Center
erfahren Sie mehr über diese Partnerschaften. Ob X Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an diese Partner weitergibt, steuern Sie über die Option „Datenaustausch mit Geschäftspartnern“ in Ihren
Einstellungen für Datenschutz und Sicherheit
. (Diese Einstellung steuert nicht die Weitergabe, die an anderer Stelle in diesen Datenschutzrichtlinien beschrieben wird, wie beispielsweise wenn wir Daten mit unseren Dienstleistern oder durch andere als die in diesem
Hilfe-Center
-Artikel beschriebenen Partnerschaften teilen.)
3.2 Mit Drittanbietern und Drittanbieterintegrationen.
An Dienstleister.
Wir können Ihre Daten an unsere
Dienstleister
weitergeben, die in unserem Auftrag Funktionen und Dienste erbringen, u.a. Zahlungsdienstleister, die Zahlungen ermöglichen; Servicepartner, die unsere verschiedenen Blogs und Wikis hosten; Servicepartner, die uns helfen, die Nutzung unserer Dienste zu verstehen, Anbieter von Bewerberverfolgungssystemen, die Bewerber- und Stellendaten an mögliche Arbeitgeber versenden und von ihnen enthalten, und solche, die Betrugserkennungsdienste anbieten.
An Werbekunden.
Werbeeinnahmen ermöglichen es uns, unsere Produkte und Dienste zur Verfügung zu stellen. Werbekunden können Daten aus Ihrer Interaktion mit ihren Werbeanzeigen auf oder außerhalb von X erhalten. Wenn Sie beispielsweise in unseren Diensten auf einen externen Link oder eine Werbeanzeige klicken, kann der Werbekunde oder der Betreiber der Website herausfinden, dass Sie von X gekommen sind, zusammen mit anderen Daten, die mit der Werbeanzeige, auf die Sie geklickt haben, verknüpft sind, wie beispielsweise Merkmale der Zielgruppe, die damit erreicht werden sollte, und andere von X generierte Identifikatoren für diese Werbeanzeige. Sie können auch andere personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen erheben, wie beispielsweise Cookie-Identifikatoren oder Ihre IP-Adresse.
Inhalte und Integrationen von Dritten.
Wir geben Ihre Daten mit Ihrer Einwilligung oder auf Ihre Anweisung hin weiter oder legen diese offen, beispielsweise wenn Sie
einen Web-Client oder eine Applikation eines Dritten autorisieren
, auf Ihren Account zuzugreifen, oder uns anweisen, Ihr Feedback an ein Unternehmen weiterzugeben. Gleichfalls arbeiten wir zur Verbesserung Ihrer Nutzung mit Dritten zusammen, damit ihre Videoinhalte auf X angezeigt oder Inhalte plattformübergreifend geteilt werden können. Wenn Sie sich Inhalte unserer Videopartner oder plattformübergreifenden Partner ansehen oder anderweitig mit diesen interagieren, können diese Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erhalten und verarbeiten, wie in ihren Datenschutzerklärungen beschrieben. Für Videoinhalte können Sie Ihre
Autoplay-Einstellungen
anpassen, wenn Sie möchten, dass die Inhalte nicht automatisch abgespielt werden.
Kooperation mit Dritten.
Wenn Sie die entsprechenden
Einstellungen
vorgenommen haben oder sich dazu entschließen, Ihre Daten weiterzugeben, können wir Ihre Informationen an Dritte weitergeben oder offenlegen. Wenn Sie sich nicht abmelden, können die Empfänger der Informationen diese in einigen Fällen zusätzlich zu den in der Datenschutzrichtlinie von X genannten Zwecken auch für ihre eigenen unabhängigen Zwecke verwenden, darunter beispielsweise zum Trainieren ihrer Modelle künstlicher Intelligenz, ob generativ oder anderweitig.
Durch unsere APIs.
Wir verwenden Technologien wie
APIs
und Einbettungen zur Bereitstellung öffentlicher X Daten für Websites, Apps und andere zu ihrer Nutzung, zum Beispiel damit Posts auf einer Nachrichten-Website angezeigt werden können oder damit analysiert werden kann, was Personen auf X äußern. Wir stellen diese Inhalte in der Regel in begrenztem Umfang kostenlos zur Verfügung und erheben Lizenzgebühren für den Zugriff in großem Umfang. Wir haben
Standard
-Geschäftsbedingungen, die regeln, wie diese Daten verwendet werden können, und ein Compliance-Programm zur Durchsetzung dieser Bedingungen. Diese Personen und Unternehmen sind jedoch nicht mit X verbunden und ihre Angebote spiegeln möglicherweise nicht die Aktualisierungen wider, die Sie auf X vornehmen. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie wir der Welt öffentliche Daten auf X zur Verfügung stellen, finden Sie unter
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 In Fällen, in denen es gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist, zur Verhinderung von Schaden oder im öffentlichen Interesse.
Wir können Ihre Daten aufbewahren, verwenden, weitergeben oder offenlegen, wenn wir glauben, dass es für einen der folgenden Zwecke vernünftigerweise notwendig ist:
zur Einhaltung eines Gesetzes, einer Verordnung oder
zur Erfüllung eines rechtsgültigen Verfahrens oder einer behördlichen Anfrage
zum Schutz der Sicherheit einer Person, zum Schutz der Sicherheit oder Integrität unserer Plattform, u. a. zur Verhinderung von Spam, Missbrauch oder böswilligen Akteuren auf unseren Diensten
Erklären, warum wir Inhalte oder Konten aus unseren Diensten entfernt haben (z. B. wegen eines Verstoßes gegen
unsere Regeln
);
zur Lösung von Problemen mit Betrug und Sicherheit oder technischen Problemen
zum Schutz unserer Rechte oder unseres Eigentum oder der Rechte oder des Eigentums der Personen, die unsere Dienste nutzen
Wir können außerdem verschiedene Signale und Ihre Daten zur Ableitung, Aufbewahrung, Nutzung, Weiterleitung oder Offenlegung Ihres Alter und Ihrer Identitätsinformationen heranziehen, damit wir gesetzliche Vorschriften einhalten können sowie je nach Sachlage im Interesse von Sicherheit, Schutz, Betrugsbekämpfung, Sorgfaltspflichten in Bezug auf Kund*innen und Unternehmen sowie zur Identitätsprüfung. Zu diesen Zwecken können wir Ihre Alters- und Identitätsinformationen auch an unsere Partner, Dienstanbieter und andere weitergeben oder offenlegen.
3.4 An unsere verbundenen Unternehmen.
Wir können Daten an unsere
verbundenen Unternehmen
weitergeben, damit unsere Produkte und Dienste zur Verfügung gestellt werden können.
3.5 Änderung der Eigentumsverhältnisse.
Wir können Daten über Sie in Verbindung mit einer Fusion, Übernahme, Reorganisation, einem Verkauf von Vermögenswerten oder einem Konkurs weitergeben, verkaufen oder übertragen. Diese Datenschutzerklärung gilt für Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, die (vor und nach dem Abschluss einer Transaktion) an das neue Unternehmen weitergegeben oder übertragen werden.
4. Wie lange wir Daten aufbewahren
Wir bewahren verschiedene Arten von Informationen für unterschiedlich lange Zeiträume auf, abhängig davon, wie lange wir sie benötigen, damit wir Ihnen unsere Produkte und Dienste bereitstellen und unseren gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen nachkommen können, sowie aus Sicherheitsgründen. Zum Beispiel:
Wir speichern Ihre Profilinformationen wie Ihren Anzeigenamen, Benutzernamen, Ihr Passwort und Ihre E-Mail-Adresse für die Dauer Ihres Kontos. Ohne die Speicherung dieser Informationen können wir Ihnen unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen nicht bereitstellen.
Wir speichern Ihre Nutzungsinformationen, beispielsweise die von Ihnen veröffentlichten Inhalte, Ihre Interaktionen mit den Inhalten anderer Nutzer*innen und Ihre Interaktion mit anderen auf der Plattform, solange Ihr Account besteht oder bis diese Inhalte entfernt werden.
Wir speichern Ihre Zahlungsinformationen, einschließlich Ihrer Kredit- oder Debitkartennummer und Rechnungsadresse, für die Dauer, in der Sie unsere kostenpflichtigen Produkte und Dienste nutzen. Aufzeichnungen von Transaktionen werden im Einklang mit geltendem Recht länger aufbewahrt.
Wenn Sie mit uns kommunizieren, beispielsweise per E-Mail, bewahren wir Informationen über die Kommunikation und deren Inhalt bis zu 18 Monate lang auf, es sei denn, wir müssen sie für einen längeren Zeitraum aufbewahren, um unseren gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen nachzukommen oder unsere gesetzlichen Rechte auszuüben oder zu verteidigen.
Wir erfassen Geräteinformationen, Standortinformationen, abgeleitete Identitätsinformationen und Protokollinformationen im Allgemeinen mithilfe von Cookies. Wir bewahren Cookies und mithilfe von Cookies erfasste Informationen bis zu 13 Monate lang auf. Weitere Informationen zur Verwendung von Cookies und ähnlichen Technologien finden Sie
hier
.
Informationen zu Ihren Ansichten oder Interaktionen mit Anzeigen mit oder ohne X sowie zu Ihrer Interaktion mit unseren Inhalten auf Websites von Drittanbietern speichern wir bis zu 90 Tage lang.
Wir speichern von Werbe- und Geschäftspartnern weitergegebene Informationen bis zu 90 Tage lang.
Wenn Sie gegen unsere Regeln verstoßen und Ihr Account gesperrt wird, können wir die Identifikatoren, die Sie zur Erstellung des Accounts verwendet haben (z. B. E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer), auf unbestimmte Zeit speichern. Dadurch wollen wir verhindern, dass Wiederholungstäter*innen neue Accounts erstellen.
Um gesetzliche Anforderungen zu erfüllen und aus Sicherheitsgründen müssen wir bestimmte Informationen möglicherweise länger aufbewahren, als in unseren Richtlinien angegeben. Zum Beispiel:
Damit wir einem Gesetz, einer Verordnung, einem rechtsgültigen Verfahren oder einer behördlichen Anfrage nachkommen können.
Darunter fällt die Erfüllung einer rechtlich angemessenen Aufbewahrungsanfrage von Strafverfolgungsbehörden. Weitere Informationen zum Zugriff durch Strafverfolgungsbehörden finden Sie
hier
.
Im Zusammenhang mit Rechtsansprüchen, Rechtsstreitigkeiten und behördlichen Angelegenheiten.
Einschließlich der Fälle, in denen es vernünftigerweise notwendig ist, Informationen zu Ihrem Konto aufzubewahren, um X gegen Rechtsansprüche zu verteidigen.
Um die Sicherheit unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu gewährleisten.
Einschließlich der Fälle, in denen es erforderlich ist, Ihre Daten länger zu speichern, um den Missbrauch unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu untersuchen und zu bekämpfen.
Bedenken Sie, dass öffentliche Inhalte auch nach ihrer Entfernung von X noch woanders vorhanden sein können. Suchmaschinen und andere Drittanbieter können beispielsweise Kopien Ihrer Beiträge auf Grundlage ihrer eigenen Datenschutzrichtlinien länger aufbewahren, selbst nachdem sie auf X gelöscht wurden oder abgelaufen sind. Weitere Informationen zur Suchsichtbarkeit finden Sie
hier
.
5. Übernehmen Sie die Kontrolle
5.1 Zugriff, Berichtigung, Übertragbarkeit.
Sie können auf die Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung gestellt haben, zugreifen, sie berichtigen oder ändern, indem Sie Ihr Profil bearbeiten und Ihre Account-
Einstellungen
anpassen.
Unter
Deine X Daten
erfahren Sie mehr über die Daten, die wir über Sie erhoben oder abgeleitet haben.
Hier
können Sie Zugriff auf weitere Daten anfordern.
Sie können eine Kopie Ihrer Daten, z. B. Ihrer Posts, herunterladen, indem Sie den Anweisungen
hier
folgen.
Zum Schutz Ihrer Privatsphäre und zur Aufrechterhaltung der Sicherheit ergreifen wir Maßnahmen zur Überprüfung Ihrer Identität, bevor wir Ihnen Auskunft über Ihre personenbezogenen Daten gewähren oder einem Antrag auf Löschung, Übertragbarkeit oder einem anderen damit zusammenhängenden Antrag nachkommen. In bestimmten Situationen können wir Ihren Antrag auf Zugriff, Berichtigung oder Übertragbarkeit ablehnen, z. B. wenn Sie Ihre Identität nicht nachweisen können.
5.2 Löschung Ihrer Daten.
Wenn Sie den Anweisungen
hier
folgen, wird Ihr Account deaktiviert und Ihre Daten werden in eine Warteschlange zur Löschung gestellt. Ist Ihr X Account deaktiviert, sind der Account, Ihr Anzeigename, Ihr Nutzername und Ihr öffentliches Profil auf X.com, in X für iOS und in X für Android nicht mehr sichtbar. Bis zu 30 Tage nach der Deaktivierung ist eine Wiederherstellung Ihres X Accounts möglich, falls er versehentlich oder fälschlich deaktiviert wurde.
5.3 Widerspruch, Einschränkung oder Rückzug Ihrer Einwilligung.
Hier
können Sie Ihre Datenschutzeinstellungen und andere Account-Funktionen verwalten. Wenn Sie Ihre Einstellungen ändern, kann es einige Zeit dauern, bis Ihre Auswahl in unseren Systemen vollständig umgesetzt ist. Abhängig davon, welche Einstellungen Sie angepasst haben, können Sie auch Änderungen bei Ihrer X Nutzung oder Einschränkungen beim Zugriff auf bestimmte Funktionen feststellen. Sie können auch zusätzliche Einstellungen verwalten, wenn Sie mit bestimmten Inhalten und Funktionen in verschiedenen Teilen der Plattform interagieren, z. B. ob ein
Space
aufgezeichnet wird oder ob
Videos, die Sie hochladen,
von anderen heruntergeladen werden können.
5.4 Anfragen von bevollmächtigten Vertreter*innen.
Wenn Sie eine Anfrage bezüglich des Zugriffs, der Berichtigung oder der Löschung Ihrer Daten oder der Daten einer anderen Person, deren bevollmächtigte*r Vertreter*in Sie sind, stellen möchten, können Sie sich auch mit der Methode an uns wenden, die im Abschnitt „Wie kann ich X kontaktieren?“ unserer Datenschutzrichtlinien unten beschrieben ist. Wir können von Ihnen verlangen, dass Sie zusätzliche Daten zur Überprüfung zur Verfügung stellen.
6. Ihre und unsere Rechte
Wir stellen X Personen auf der ganzen Welt zur Verfügung und bieten allen unseren Nutzer*innen, unabhängig von ihrem Wohnort, viele der gleichen Datenschutz-Tools und Kontrollmöglichkeiten. Es kann jedoch sein, dass sich Ihre Nutzung etwas anders gestaltet als für Nutzer*innen in anderen Ländern. Das soll sicherstellen, dass X die lokalen Anforderungen respektiert.
6.1 Wir stützen uns bei der Nutzung Ihrer Daten auf bestimmte Rechtsgrundlagen.
X hat die Rechtsgrundlagen, auf deren Grundlage es X erlaubt ist, Ihre Daten zu erheben, zu verwenden, weiterzugeben und anderweitig zu verarbeiten, sorgfältig geprüft. Wenn Sie mehr erfahren und die Feinheiten besser verstehen möchten, empfehlen wir Ihnen, sich diese
zusätzlichen Informationen über die Datenverarbeitung
anzusehen. Und nein, wir verkaufen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht.
6.2 Wir verlagern Ihre Daten, damit X für Sie funktioniert.
So wie Sie sich mit X nahtlos an globalen Konversationen mit Personen in Ländern auf der ganzen Welt beteiligen, muss X Daten über Grenzen hinweg und in verschiedene Länder auf der ganzen Welt verlagern, damit der sichere und zuverlässige Dienst, auf den Sie sich verlassen, möglich wird. Wenn Sie zum Beispiel in Europa leben und eine Konversation mit jemandem in den USA führen, müssen Daten zwischen diesen Ländern ausgetauscht werden, damit die Konversation möglich wird. Das ist es, was Sie von uns erwarten.
Wir nutzen auch Rechenzentren und Cloud-Anbieter und beauftragen
unsere verbundenen Unternehmen
sowie Dritte und
Dienstleister
in vielen Teilen der Welt, damit sie uns bei der Bereitstellung unserer Dienste helfen. Bevor wir Daten zwischen Ländern übertragen, prüfen wir die Risiken, die für die Daten bestehen können, und verlassen uns, sofern zutreffend, auf
Standardvertragsklauseln
(SCCs), um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Datenschutzrechte geschützt sind. Um eine Kopie der SCCs anzufordern, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte
hier
. Wenn Daten an Dritte weitergegeben werden, verlangen wir von ihnen, dass sie den gleichen Schutz für Ihre Daten gewährleisten, wie wir selbst bieten.
X ist an Datenschutz-Rahmenvereinbarungen (Data Privacy Frameworks, DPF) zwischen der EU und den USA und zwischen der Schweiz und den USA und an der Ausweitung des EU-US PDF auf das Vereinigte Königreich
beteiligt
. X beachtet bei jeglicher Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten, die aus der Europäischen Union, der Schweiz und dem Vereinigten Königreich stammen, die DPF-Prinzipien in Bezug auf die DPF zwischen der EU und den USA bzw. der Schweiz und den USA bzw. in Bezug auf die Ausweitung des EU-US PDF auf das Vereinigte Königreich. Wenn Sie eine Anfrage oder Beschwerde bezüglich unserer Teilnahme am DPF haben, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte
hier
. Im Rahmen unserer Beteiligung an den DPF versuchen wir bei Streitigkeiten zwischen Ihnen und uns in Bezug auf unsere Einhaltung der DPF-Prinzipien, diese durch unser internes Beschwerdeverfahren zu lösen, alternativ durch die in den USA basierte unabhängige Schlichtungsstelle
JAMS
, und unter bestimmten Bedingungen durch das DPF-Schlichtungsverfahren anhand der Verfahren und gemäß den Bedingungen, die in
Anhang 1
zu den DPF-Prinzipien beschrieben sind. DPF-Teilnehmer unterliegen den Untersuchungs- und Durchsetzungsbefugnissen der US-amerikanischen Federal Trade Commission und anderer autorisierter gesetzlicher Stellen. Unter bestimmten Umständen können die beteiligten Parteien für die Übertragung personenbezogener Daten aus der EU, der Schweiz und dem Vereinigten Königreich an Dritte außerhalb der EU, der Schweiz und des Vereinigten Königreichs haftbar sein. Weitere Informationen zum EU-US-DPF, zum Schweiz-US-DPF und zur britischen Erweiterung des EU-US-DPF
finden Sie hier
.
7. Die Zielgruppe von X
Unsere Dienste richten sich nicht an Kinder und Sie dürfen unsere Dienste nicht nutzen, wenn Sie unter 13 Jahre alt sind. Sie müssen außerdem alt genug sein, um der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten in Ihrem Land zuzustimmen (in manchen Ländern gestatten wir möglicherweise Ihren
Eltern oder Erziehungsberechtigten, dies in Ihrem Namen zu tun
). Wir erfassen wissentlich keine personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern unter 13 Jahren. Wenn Sie feststellen, dass Ihr Kind uns ohne Ihr Einverständnis personenbezogene Daten übermittelt hat, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte
hier
. Wenn wir feststellen, dass ein Kind unter 13 Jahren uns personenbezogene Daten übermittelt hat, ergreifen wir Maßnahmen, um diese Daten zu entfernen und das Konto des Kindes zu kündigen. Weitere Ressourcen für Eltern und Jugendliche finden Sie
hier
.
8. Änderungen an diesen Datenschutzrichtlinien
Die aktuellste Version dieser Datenschutzerklärung regelt unsere Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten und wir können diese Datenschutzerklärung gelegentlich nach Bedarf überarbeiten.
Wenn wir diese Datenschutzrichtlinien überarbeiten und Änderungen vornehmen, die wir als wesentlich erachten, werden wir Sie darüber informieren und Ihnen die Möglichkeit geben, die überarbeiteten Datenschutzrichtlinien zu überprüfen, bevor Sie X weiter nutzen.
9. Allgemein
Die X Datenschutzrichtlinien sind auf Englisch verfasst, werden aber durch Übersetzungen in mehreren Sprachen verfügbar gemacht. X strebt an, dass die Übersetzungen die englische Originalversion so genau wie möglich wiedergeben. Im Falle von Abweichungen oder Unstimmigkeiten hat jedoch die englischsprachige Version der X Datenschutzrichtlinien Vorrang. Sie erkennen an, dass Englisch die Referenzsprache für die Interpretation und Konstruktion der Bedingungen der X Datenschutzrichtlinien ist.

Reddit Privacy Policy
Effective: August 16, 2024. Last Revised: August 16, 2024.
Introduction
At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to be the masters
      of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why Reddit
      (“Reddit,“ “we“ or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our
      websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services
      (collectively, the “Services“) or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a
      communication from us.
We want this privacy policy to empower you to make better choices about how you use Reddit.
      We'd love for you to read the whole policy, but if you don't, here is the TL;DR:
Reddit is a public platform.
Reddit is a public platform. Our communities are largely public and anyone can see your
      profile, posts, and comments.
We collect minimal information about you.
We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by default. If you want to
      just browse, you don't need an account. If you want to create an account to participate in a
      subreddit, we don't require you to give us your real name. We don't track your precise
      location. You can even browse
anonymously
. You can share as much or as little about yourself as you want when using Reddit.
We only use data to make Reddit a better place.
Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our Services, which are focused on allowing
      people to come together and form communities. We don't sell your personal data to third
      parties, and we never work with data brokers.
All of our users get privacy rights - not just those in select countries.
Privacy rights are for everyone. At Reddit, anyone can request a copy of their data, account
      deletion, or information about our policies.
If you have questions about how we use data, just ask.
We've tried our best to make this as easy to understand as possible but sometimes privacy
      policies are still confusing. If you need help understanding this policy or anything about
      Reddit,
just ask
.
Reddit Is a Public Platform
Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an
    account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and
    freely.
When you submit content (e.g., a post, comment, or chat message) to a public part of the
    Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the
    username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the
    content. That content and information may also be available in search results on Internet search
    engines like Google or in responses provided by an AI chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. You should
    take the public nature of the Services into consideration before posting.
Your Reddit account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about
    your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma,
    trophies received, profile display name, about section, and social links, avatar or profile
    image, moderator, contributor, and Reddit Premium status, communities you are active in, and how
    long you have been a member of the Services (your cake day).
We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services
    with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with
    your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that
    provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data
    collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy
    policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g.,
Tumblr
,
Facebook
, and
X
).
Reddit allows moderators to access Reddit content using moderator bots and tools. Reddit also
    allows other third parties to access public Reddit content using Reddit’s developer services,
    including Reddit Embeds, our APIs, Developer Platform, and similar technologies. We limit
    third-party access to this content and require third parties to pay licensing fees for access to
    larger quantities of content. Reddit’s
Developer Terms
are our
    standard terms governing how these services are used by third parties. Please review our public
    content policy
here
for more information about how your public content is publicly available and accessible to
    anyone with access to the internet.
What Information We Collect
Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services.
                      This includes:
Account information
You don't need an account to use Reddit. If you create a Reddit account,
                        your account will have a username, which you provide or which is
                        automatically generated. Your username is public, and it doesn't have to be
                        related to your real name. You may need to provide a password, depending on
                        whether you register using an email address, Single Sign-On (SSO) feature
                        (such as Apple or Google), or phone number. If your account does not have a
                        password, we may send you a SMS message for verification purposes. We may
                        also ask you to select interests during account creation (for example,
                        history, nature, sports) to help generate a home feed for you, or to select
                        communities (such as, r/technology) to join.
When you use Reddit, you may also provide other information, such as a bio,
                        gender, age, location, profile picture, or social link. This information is
                        optional and may be removed at any time.
We also store your user account preferences and settings. We may ask for
                        such information prior to you creating a username or account to help improve
                        your experience exploring Reddit.
Non-Public Content You Submit
In addition to the public content you submit to the Services, we also
                        collect non-public content. This includes your saved drafts of posts or
                        comments, your messages with other users (such as private messages, chats,
                        and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and
                        with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, audio, videos,
                        software, and tools.
Actions you take
We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services.
                        This includes your interactions with the platform and content, like voting,
                        saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other
                        users, such as following, and blocking. We collect your interactions with
                        communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.
Transactional information
If you purchase products or services from us or otherwise through the
                        Services, you will have to provide payment information in order to complete
                        your purchase. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services
                        (such as Stripe) to handle payment information, and those services are
                        subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. We will
                        collect information about the product or service you are purchasing (for
                        example, purchase dates, amounts paid or received, and expiration and
                        renewal dates).
We may also collect public blockchain data and addresses, such as when you
                        purchase or create a Collectible Avatar, receive or mint an NFT, or create a
                        Reddit Vault. However, we never store Reddit Vault private key information.
Other information
You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we
                        may collect information when you fill out a form, survey, participate in
                        Reddit-sponsored activities, promotions, or programs, apply for a job,
                        request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.
Information We Collect Automatically
When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect
                      information about you. This includes:
Log and usage data
We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may
                        include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system,
                        referral URLs, device information (such as device IDs), device settings,
                        mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and
                        search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit
                        will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.
Information collected from cookies and similar technologies
We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your
                        browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar
                        technologies. We use this information to deliver and maintain our Services,
                        improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and
                        advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertising, and improve the
                        quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information
                        about your preferred language and other settings. See our
Cookie Notice
for more
                        information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you
                        can disable cookies, please see “Your Choices” below.
Location information
We may receive and process information about your location. We may receive
                        location information from you when you choose to share such information on
                        our Services, including via the Location Customization setting or by
                        associating your content with a location, or we may derive an approximate
                        location based on your IP address.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other
                      users and third parties, and combine that information with the other
                      information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or
                      interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such
                      as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and
                      combine it with data you have provided to Reddit, using a common account
                      identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can
                      control how we use this information to personalize advertisements for you by
                      visiting the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section
                      titled “Your Rights and Choices” below.
Linked services
If you authorize or link a third-party service, such as an unofficial mobile
                        app client, to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about
                        your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services
                        may also cause the other service to send us information about your account
                        with that service. For example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party
                        identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us. To
                        learn how information is shared with linked services, see “How Information
                        About You Is Shared” below.
Information collected from integrations
We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and
                        cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services,
                        including our embeds and advertising technology. For example, when you visit
                        a site that uses
Reddit embeds
,
                        we may receive information about the web page you visited. Similarly, if an
                        advertiser incorporates Reddit’s ad technology, Reddit may receive limited
                        information about your activity on the advertiser’s site or app, such as
                        whether you bought something from the advertiser. You can control how we use
                        this information to personalize the Services for you as described in “Your
                        Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics” below.
Information Collected by Third Parties
Embedded content
Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Services via embeds. For
                        example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or X may load the linked video or
                        tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don't
                        have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how
                        third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly
                        via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this
                        privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is
                        embedded.
Audience measurement
We partner with service providers that perform audience measurement to learn
                        demographic information about the population that uses Reddit. To provide
                        this demographic information, these companies collect cookie information to
                        recognize your device.
Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers
Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers If you use
                      Reddit Ads (Reddit’s self-serve ads platform at ads.reddit.com), on behalf of
                      your business or organization, we collect some additional information. To sign
                      up for Reddit Ads, you must provide your name, email address, and information
                      about your company. Reddit may make information about your company public to
                      comply with applicable law. If you purchase advertising services, you will
                      need to provide transactional information as described above, and we may also
                      require additional documentation to verify your identity. When using Reddit
                      Ads, we may record a session replay of your visit for customer service,
                      troubleshooting, and usability research purposes.
Information Collected from Reddit Pro Users
If you sign up for Reddit Pro, on behalf of yourself, your business or
                      organization, we may collect some additional information from you, including
                      your profile type, name, industry category, website, and organization size, if
                      applicable. If you request certain limited Reddit Pro features, we may request
                      additional documentation to verify your identity.
Information Collected from Reddit Program Participants and Potential
                        Participants
If you sign up to participate in a Reddit Program (for example, our
                      Contributor Program), we collect, directly or indirectly through our
                      providers, some additional information from you (such as your name, date of
                      birth, address, email, tax, government ID, and payment information). This
                      additional information is used and shared with our third-party payment and
                      compliance providers to determine your eligibility to participate in the
                      applicable Reddit Program, facilitate payments, and comply with law. Those
                      providers and their services are subject to separate terms and conditions and
                      privacy policies.
How We Use Information
We use information about you to:
Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;
Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and
      settings;
Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers,
      addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit User Agreement and our
other terms and policies
, as well as comply
      with applicable law;
Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services;
Research and develop new services;
Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and
      administrative messages;
Provide customer service;
Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, events, and programs, and
      provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about
      how to opt out of these communications, see “Your Choices” below); and
Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services.
How We Share Information
In addition to the content that is displayed publicly as described above, we may share
    information in the following ways:
With your consent
. We may share information about you with your consent or at your
      direction. For example, at your direction through social sharing features that allow you to
      share content with third party sites like Tumblr and X.
With linked services
. If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service,
      Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control
      this sharing as described in "Your Rights and Choices" below.
With our service providers
. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and
      other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. Their
      use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. A
      few examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud
      providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who
      help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services, and (iv)
      compliance providers who help us determine your eligibility to participate in Reddit Programs.
To comply with the law
. We may share information if we believe disclosure is in
      accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or
      governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law
      enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with
      prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our
Transparency Report
has
      additional information about how we respond to government requests.
In an emergency
. We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent
      imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
To enforce our rights and promote safety and security
. We may share information if we
      believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement,
rules
, or
other Reddit terms and policies
, or to
      protect the rights, property, and safety of the Services, ourselves, and others.
With our affiliates
. We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of
      our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
Aggregated or de-identified information
. We may share information about you that has
      been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For
      example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who
      the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many people saw their ad.
How We Protect Your Information
We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS
        while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access
        controls to limit which of our employees have access to non-public personal information.
You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring
two-factor authentication
.
We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for
        which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business
        purposes and/or if we believe doing so is in accordance with, or as required by, any
        applicable law. For example, if you violate our policies and your account is suspended or
        banned, we may store the identifiers used to create the account (such as phone number) to
        prevent you from creating new accounts.
Your Rights and Choices
You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of
        information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also
        have the right to correction/rectification of your personal information, to opt out of
        certain advertising practices, or to withdraw consent for processing where you have
        previously provided consent. Below we explain how to exercise each of these rights. Reddit
        does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.
Accessing and Changing Your Information
You can access your information and change or correct certain information
                          through the Services. See our
Help Center
page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal
                          information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described
here
.
Deleting Your Account
You may delete your account information at any time from the user
                          preferences page. For more information, please visit our
Help Center
. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to
                          other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account.
                          Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted
                          prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you
                          first delete the specific content. After you submit a request to delete
                          your account, our purge script commences the deletion process within 90
                          days. After running our purge script, Reddit will not be able to provide
                          access to deleted data. We may also retain certain information about you
                          for legitimate business purposes and/or if we believe doing so is in
                          accordance with, or as required by, any applicable law.
Controlling Linked Services' Access to Your Account
You can review the services you have permitted to access your account and
                          revoke access to individual services by visiting your account’s
Apps page
(for third-party
                          app authorizations), the Connected Accounts section of your
Account Settings
(for Google
                          Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, and connected X accounts), and the Social
                          links section of your
Profile Settings
.
Controlling Personalized Advertising
You may opt out of us using information we collect from third parties,
                          including advertising partners, to personalize the ads you see on Reddit.
                          To do so, visit the Privacy section of the User Settings in your account
here
, if using
                          desktop, and in your Account Settings if using the Reddit mobile app.
Controlling the Use of Cookies
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you
                          can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and
                          third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject
                          cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our
                          Services. For more information on controlling how cookies and similar
                          technologies are used on Reddit, see our
Cookie Notice
.
Controlling Advertising and Analytics
Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out
                          mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional
                          tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies
                          and how you can opt out. For example, you may manage the use and
                          collection of certain information by
Google Analytics
via the
Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on
. You can opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by
Nielsen
and
Quantcast
.
You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements
                          from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about
                          these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the sites of the
Digital Advertising Alliance
and the
Network Advertising Initiative
, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area,
Your Online Choices
.
Do Not Track
Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal
                          to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
                          However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to
                          this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.
                          Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you
                          the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of
                          information about you.
Controlling Promotional Communications
You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional
                          communications from us by following the instructions in those
                          communications or by updating your email options in your account
                          preferences
here
. If you opt
                          out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional
                          communications, such as information about your account or your use of the
                          Services.
Controlling Mobile Notifications
With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push
                          notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these
                          messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile
                          device.
Controlling Location Information
You can control how we use location information for feed and
                          recommendations customization via the
Location Customization
setting in your Account Settings.
If you have questions or are not able to submit a request to exercise your rights using
          the mechanisms above, you may also email us at
redditdatarequests@reddit.com
from the
          email address that you have verified with your Reddit account, or submit them

Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify
          the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address
          associated with your Reddit account. If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision
          by contacting us at
redditdatarequests@reddit.com

International Data Transfers
Reddit, Inc. is based in the United States and we process and store information on servers
      located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other
      countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service
      providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you
      consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the United States

When we transfer the personal data of users in the EEA, UK and/or Switzerland, we rely on the
      Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such transfers or other
      transfer mechanisms deemed ‘adequate’ under applicable laws.

, regardless of your citizenship or location. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions
. You can opt out or unsubscribe to a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some Services, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list. If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.
Direct Mailings, Push Notifications, and Unsubscribing.
Where you have consented to receive marketing communications from us, we will send you emails and/or push notifications (depending on what you have consented to).  You may withdraw your consent for email marketing communications (i.e. unsubscribe) at any time by (i) clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in a marketing communication email we send you; or (ii) using the “Notifications” or “Settings” page in the account area.   You may withdraw your consent for web-related notifications (i.e. unsubscribe) at any time through your browser settings.  You may also withdraw your consent by emailing our support team(s) at the email addresses below.  Please allow two working days for this instruction to take effect in all of our systems.

However, you may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

While we give our users many avenues to opt out of providing Personal Information, we do not respond to Web browsers’ “do not track” signals. California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our users who are California residents to periodically request and obtain certain information about any Personal Information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes.

These rights include, in accordance with applicable law, the right to object to or request the restriction of processing of your information, and to request access to, rectification, erasure and portability of your own information. Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases). Requests should be submitted by contacting us using the
Privacy Portal
Opens a new window
. If you have any further questions upon receipt of your completed DSAR or if you would like to appeal in case your DSAR is denied, please resubmit a DSAR request using the DSAR form at

Cookie Policy
Effective May 18, 2018
This Cookie Policy explains when and why cookies are used by Ziff Davis, LLC, and its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “
Ziff Davis
”, “
we
”, “
us
” or “
our
”), on our websites, applications, advertisements and related services, including emails, newsletters and on certain partner and licensee websites that we do not own or operate but with whom we have agreements (together, the “
Service
”).
What are Cookies?
Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to the devices you use to reach and use the Service. Your browser or device holds these cookies and makes them available every time you visit a site again so that it can recognize you and remember important information about you.
Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in your browser or device until you leave the site. They are then deleted from your device once you leave the Service.
Persistent Cookies remain in your browser or device for much longer – they remain there until you delete them or they reach their expiry date, depending on the cookie. These may, for example, be used to remember your preferences when you use the Service, recognize you on your return, and enhance your experience on the Service. Use of a persistent cookie may be linked to personal information while interacting with the Service, such as when you choose to store your user names so that you do not have to enter them each time you access your accounts. Then, a persistent cookie will be stored on your computer, which is linked to your account information. If you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Service but you will be limited in some areas of it.
**For more information on cookies please visit:
https://www.allaboutcookies.org/
**
Can I Change My Cookie Preferences?
You can always change your cookie preferences or delete cookies altogether as discussed below.
Browser settings also allow you to choose whether or not to accept cookies or limit certain cookies. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies. You may wish to refer to
this guide
Opens a new window
for information on commonly used browsers. If you use the Service without changing your browser settings, we will assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on the Service. Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Service may operate as intended.
If you would prefer that we not collect information that may be used to help determine which advertisements to serve you, opt out by clicking this icon , which can be found on most of our webpages and applications. You may also opt out or change your behavioral advertising cookie preferences by visiting the opt-out page for the
Digital Advertising Alliance

(U.S. residents and those not in the EU or Canada), the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
Opens a new window
(EU residents), or the

(Canadian residents).
Flash Cookies (also known as Local Shared Objects) cannot be changed by browser settings. The Adobe website provides comprehensive information on how to delete or disable Flash cookies –
see Adobe’s website
Opens a new window
for further information. Please be aware that if you disable or reject Flash cookies for the Service, you may not be able to access certain features, such as video content or services that require you to sign in.
Your mobile operating system may let you opt out from having your information collected or used for interest-based advertising on mobile devices. You should refer to the instructions provided by your mobile device’s manufacturer, but this functionality is usually available in the “Settings” section of your device. You can also stop us from collecting information by turning off data collection for interest-based advertising in our applications or by uninstalling our applications.
Does this Policy Change?
We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please take a look at the date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last updated. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on the Service.
How Does Ziff Davis Use Cookies?
The types of information typically collected by cookies include information relating to your use of the Service, your device’s IP address and browser type, how you arrived on one of the Services, your name, and email address if you are logging in, etc.
What Cookies Do We Use?
Below is a list of each category of cookies we use and why we use each cookie. First party cookies are our own cookies set by Ziff Davis, controlled by us and used to provide information about the usage of the Service.
Essential Cookies or Strictly Necessary Cookies
: These cookies are essential to the Service in order for you to move around the Service and to use its features. Without these cookies, certain features could not function. No information about your browsing habits is gathered by these cookies.
Functional Cookies
: These cookies remember how you prefer to use the Service and enable us to improve the way the Service works. We can remember your settings and help provide you with ads. Functional Cookies are persistent cookies that the Service remembers when your computer or device comes back to that Service.
Analytics Cookies
: Analytics Cookies allow us to improve our services by collecting information about your use of the Service. We use these cookies to help improve how the website works. For example, Analytics Cookies show us statistics, which are the most frequently visited pages on the Service, help us record any difficulties you have with the Service, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. We can’t identify you personally through the use of these cookies, but third parties who provide these cookies may be able to.
Behavioral Advertising Cookies
: Behavioral Advertising Cookies are used to deliver relevant advertisements to users both on and off the Service. We analyze what pages you visit on these sites, what products or services you view, and whether you view or click on ads that are shown to you. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action on the advertiser’s site. We use this information to send you interest-based ads and may also share this information with third parties. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we’ve shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads. We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off the Service, such as after you have visited a partner’s site or application.
Third Party Cookies
: Some of the cookies on the Service are operated by third parties, such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook or Comscore. Some of these third parties (for example third-party advertisers) may use cookies on the Service, in emails or in our advertisements on other websites to allow them to deliver the services they are providing. Some of the cookies operated by third parties may be used for analytics purposes, such as to monitor, analyze and prevent fraudulent traffic or other suspicious activities. In order to create a user-friendly experience, some of our third-party promotions and advertisements are designed to automatically transmit users’ information onto the third party’s landing page when you choose to “click” upon a third party’s advertisement or promotion. We do not control these third parties or their use of cookies. This means it is not possible for us to manage these cookies. This Policy only covers the use of cookies by Ziff Davis and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party. Some of these third party cookies are not session based and have varying expiry dates. Please check the websites of these third parties for details on how they use cookies.
Flash Cookies
: We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface that is different from the one provided by your web browser. This means that it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the browser level in the same way you would manage other types of cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s website directly. See Adobe’s
website
Opens a new window
.
Geo-Location Information
: Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Some photos or other content you place within the Service may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. Also, some of the information we collect from a device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a device’s location.
Similar Technologies
In addition to cookies, we may also use other similar tracking technologies on our services, such as pixel tags (also known as clear GIFs, pixels or web bugs), web beacons, eTags and local storage. We use these technologies to do things like store user settings video viewing history, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole or track users’ movements around the Service, to serve interest-based ads, or to improve our understanding of things like site traffic, visitor behavior and promotional campaigns. Pixel tags are small blocks of code installed in or on a web page, mobile app, or advertisement and are a method for passing information from your device to a third party website. Web beacons are electronic files that allow a website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. Local storage, such as HTML 5, allows a website or mobile app to store and retrieve data on an individual’s device. eTags are tags used to analyze trends by us and our commerce partners.
Do Not Track Response
Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a “do not track” option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different from blocking cookies as browsers with the “do not track” option selected may still accept cookies. Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to “do not track” signals, although one may be adopted in the future. We do not respond to “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will modify this Cookie Policy accordingly. More information about “do not track” is available at
www.allaboutdnt.com

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our data protection officer at

.
Legal basis
AnyDesk processes your data in accordance with the data  protection regulations of the German
Federal Data    Protection Act
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - "BDSG") in the  version valid as of May 25, 2018 and the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation  - "GDPR").
The relevant legal basis for the processing is stated in the  information on the individual categories of data.
Categories of data
AnyDesk processes different categories of personal data. In  the following sections, the data is presented according to the  group of data subjects, the respective purpose, and the relevant  legal basis.
Customers and business partners
Insofar as we are in a contractual, quasi-contractual or  pre-contractual business relationship with you, i.e. if you are  already a customer, business partner or are interested in such a  legal relationship ("contractual partner"), we process the  following data as necessary:
Personal data (e.g. names, addresses, gender, company, location)
Payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history)
Contract data (e.g. subject matter of the contract, type of license, term, customer category, customer ID, login    information)
Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content,    access times, time and duration of the respective remote data    connection (session), data volume transferred, online status of    the client)
Meta-/communication data (e.g. device information, device ID, IP and MAC addresses)
Content of communication directed at us (e.g. product or contract inquiries, error messages, responses to our    surveys)
We will inform you in a transparent manner before or during  data collection as to extent od data that is required for this  purpose. We process the data:
to be able to address you in communication,
to answer your questions,
to establish and fulfill our contractual obligations,
to protect our rights,
to protect against unauthorized use and misuse of our offers,
for related administrative tasks, and
for the purposes of business organization.
Your data is processed, in particular, to allow you to select,  acquire or order the selected products (licenses to use our  software and any associated services), as well as to enable  payment and processing. During the registration process required  to acquire a license, we will create an account for you on in our  systems ("customer account" or "user account"). During  registration, we will point out which of the above-mentioned  details are required for this purpose, in particular to verify  registration or the respective use of our login functions and the  use of the user account, and to prevent any possible misuse of  the customer account. The customer account (my.anydesk.com) gives  you access to your connection data, the contract/license  information, information about the AnyDesk clients that are  linked to the license, your master data as a customer, invoices,  and any settings for payment methods. AnyDesk customer accounts  are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. We may  use email or in-app messaging to inform users about processes  relevant to their user account (such as technical changes) or to  invite them to participate in surveys.
The legal basis for the processing is therefore:
For contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries -    Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR
With regard to legal obligation - Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR
Otherwise, with regard to our legitimate interests - Art. 6    (1) (f) GDPR
We do not store any content of the respective remote data  connection (session data) beyond the required scope of data  transfer. The customer can create a chat log or a session  recording, which is then only stored locally on the customer's  computer. AnyDesk does not access these session data.
Users of our website
Log files
When users visit our website, we (or our web hosting provider)  collect user access data (so-called server log files). The server  log files can include the following data:
The address and name of the websites and files accessed
Date and time of access
Data volumes transferred
Notification of successful access
Browser type and version
User's operating system
Referrer URL (the previously visited page)
IP address
This processing takes place to ensure problem-free connection  to and smooth use of our website, and to ensure system security  and stability. In particular, we do not use your data to draw  conclusions about your person. Information of this kind may be  statistically evaluated by us in order to optimize our website  and the technology behind it. This processing takes place in  accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR on the basis of our  legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality  of our website and preventing the misuse of our services.
Cookies
In addition, we use so-called cookies, i.e. text files that  are stored on a user's computer by a browser and contain  information about this user during or after his visit to a  website, which may be processed by us. This information includes,  for example, the login status, pages or media accessed,  pseudonymous online identification ("user" or "AnyDesk IDs"), the  content of a shopping cart, the licensed product selected, or the  user-specific settings on our websites.
Please note that there are different types of cookies with  different purposes:
First-party cookies are set by us.
Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers    (so-called third parties) to process user information.
Temporary cookies (also: session cookies) are deleted at the    latest after a user has left a website and closed his    browser.
Permanent cookies remain stored on the user's computer even    after the browser is closed. This allows, for example, saving the    login status or displaying the user-preferred content again    directly when the user visits the website later. User interests    used for audience measurement or marketing purposes may also be    stored in such a cookie.
Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies    are absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to    store logins or other user entries, or for security reasons).
Statistical, online marketing and personalization cookies,    on the other hand, are used to measure audience and to display    content to users that matches their potential interests according    to the stored data about access to certain content (so-called    tracking). If we use these types of cookies or tracking    technologies, we will inform you of this beforehand as part of    the process of obtaining your consent.
Depending on the type of cookies, we use them to process your  personal data either on the basis of a previously given consent  in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR, on the basis of our  legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (e.g.  to support the operation of our website and its improvement), or  because the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our  contractual obligations in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (b)  GDPR.
Before we process your data or have them processed in the  context of the use of cookies, when you access the page, we will  inform you about which cookies we use and will ask for your  consent, which can be revoked at any time (cookie opt-in tool or  banner). Before the consent is given, only cookies which are  absolutely necessary for the operation of our website may be  used.
In addition to the option of revoking your consent at any  time, you can also view our website without cookies. Please note  that Internet browsers are regularly set to accept cookies. In  general, you can disable the use of cookies at any time via your  browser settings. Please use the help functions of your Internet  browser to find out how you can change these settings (individual  functions of our website, such as registration and use of the  customer portal, may not work if you have disabled the use of  cookies). With regard to tracking, you can also object to the use  of cookies via a variety of services, e.g. via the websites
https://optout.aboutads.info
and
https://www.youronlinechoices.com/
(
"opt-out").
Registration and use of customer account
In the context of the registrations and use of the customer  accounts, we store the IP addresses of the customers together  with the access times in order to be able to verify the  registration and to prevent possible misuse of the customer  account. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1)  (f) GDPR.
Contact forms
When you visit the AnyDesk website, you can use a form to  contact us, in particular to request technical support. In  addition to the technical details listed in there, you must  provide your first and last name, email address, customer ID, the  text and the factual context of the inquiry. The personal data  transferred to us in this context will only be used to process  the respective inquiries. The legal basis for the data processing  is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
Surveys
We rely on the voluntary feedback from our customers and  website users in order to continuously improve our services and  products. For this reason, we also use technical services and  form functions of third-party providers, which we integrate into  our website, in order to establish contact and to design specific  surveys. In doing so, we collect the requested data, which you  enter in the form, as well as meta and communication data (e.g.  IP address), which we can assign to your customer and contract  data.
The legal basis for the use of these functions is our  legitimate interest in the target group-oriented and flexibly  adaptable presentation of contact forms on specific topics in  order to be able to efficiently analyze the review of our  services by our customers and to improve these services (Art. 6  (1) (f) GDPR). With regard to the collection of your voluntary  provided information when using these survey functions, the legal  basis is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.  Participating in the surveys is purely voluntary and is not  required for our performance of the contract.
Newsletters (email marketing)
You have the option of subscribing to a newsletter, i.e.  receiving emails from us, via our website. The specific content  of the newsletter is based on the description provided during  subscription (e.g. special offers, products and events);  otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services  and our company.
In order to subscribe, you just need to provide your email  address. It will only be used to send you the newsletter you have  subscribed to by email. After subscribing, you will receive an  email to this email address, in which you will be asked to  confirm your subscription in order to prevent someone from  subscribing with a different email address ("double-opt-in  procedure"). We record all newsletter subscriptions in order to  prove the legal conformity of the subscription process. This  includes storing the time of registration and confirmation as  well as the IP address.
Newsletters are sent on the basis of the recipient's consent,  which can be withdrawn at any time (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR), or, if  such consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate  interests in direct marketing (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR), if and to  the extent that this is permitted by law (e.g. in the case of  advertising to existing customers). The subscription process is  recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose  of proving that it has been conducted properly (Art. 6 (1) (f)  GDPR). If we commission a service provider to send emails, this  is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient  and secure mailing system (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
Please note:
The newsletters may contain a so-called  web beacon (also called tracking pixel), i.e. a pixel-sized file  that is retrieved from our server or from the server of a mailing  service provider commissioned by us when the newsletter is  opened. As part of this retrieval, we collect technical  information, such as information about the browser and your  system, as well as your IP address and the time of retrieval.
On the one hand, this information is used to improve our  newsletters on the basis of the technical data or to determine  target groups and their reading behavior on the basis of their  retrieval locations (which can be determined using the IP  address) or access times.
On the other hand, this analysis includes determining whether  or not the newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and  which links are clicked on. For technical reasons, this  information can be assigned to the individual email addresses of  the newsletter recipients. However, neither we nor the mailing  service provider commissioned by us will make such an assignment;  the data is evaluated exclusively to adapt our contents to the  reading habits of our users. This evaluation takes place, subject  to the express consent of the user to receive the newsletter, on  the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of using a  user-friendly and secure newsletter system which both serves our  business interests and meets the expectations of the users (Art.  6 (1) (f) GDPR).
You can unsubscribe from our newsletters at any time, i.e.  revoke your consent or object to further receipt of newsletters.  A link to unsubscribe from our newsletters can also be found at  the end of each newsletter.
Plugins, embedded functions and content
We integrate various functions and content from third-party  providers (e.g. graphics, videos or social media buttons and  posts) in our website in order to make relevant information about  our company and our services easily accessible to you as a user  of our website. For this purpose, the third-party providers  process the IP addresses of the users, since without the IP  address they would not be able to send the content to their  browsers.
Social media buttons
When you click on one of our social media buttons, the data is  transferred to the corresponding social network via the so-called  "Shariff" application. Instead of your browser, a connection with  the server of the respective social network platform is  established by the server on which our website is located, i.e.  initially no personal data of the user is passed on to the social  network provider. A "Shariff" button establishes direct contact  between the social network and you as a user only when you  actively click on the "Share" button. You can recognize the  respective provider of the plugin by the marking on the box or in  the circle above its respective first letter or the logo. More  information about the "Shariff project" can be obtained from the  developers of the ct magazine:
https://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html
.
Pixel tags
In addition, third-party providers may use so-called pixel  tags (also known as web beacons) in order to evaluate visitor  flows. This exclusively pseudonymous information may also be  stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain technical  information about the browser and operating system, websites to  be referred to, the time of visit, and other details on the use  of our website, and may also be linked to such information from  other sources. With regard to the legal basis and the individual  opt-out options, please refer to the information on the use of  cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Video integration
We integrate videos from the YouTube platform on our website,  in particular via a plugin, in order to provide you with visually  rich information about our products and technical processes. In  doing so, we use the YouTube "No Cookies" function, i.e. we have  enabled the "
privacy-enhanced"
function. Therefore,  videos are accessed via
youtube-nocookie.com
instead of
youtube.com
. When the relevant pages are accessed,  however, the IP address and other data mentioned under "Log  files" are transferred and thus, in particular, information is  provided as to which of our Internet pages you have visited.  However, this information cannot be associated with you if you  are permanently signed in to YouTube or another Google service  when you access the page. When you start playing such an  integrated video by clicking on it, the YouTube privacy-enhanced  mode on your device only stores cookies that do not contain any  personally identifiable information, unless you are currently  signed in to a Google service. These cookies can be blocked via  certain browser settings and extensions. With regard to the legal  basis, please also refer to the information on the use of cookies  in this Privacy Policy.
Interactive maps
Furthermore, we integrate Google Maps on our website in order  to include an interactive map directly on the website to  determine our company location and to allow you to conveniently  use the map function for better navigation. In certain versions,  the integration means that when the user accesses the website,  Google may set cookies with which a connection to the Google  network is established. The legal basis for the integration of  Google Maps and the associated data transfer to Google is your  consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Please refer to the information on  the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
eRecruiting
We also integrate a plugin for the "Prescreen" eRecruiting  system on our website. This allows us to place job advertisements  under the ".jobbase.io" domain and receive and manage  applications. Cookies may be used on our website to record users  of application forms. The legal basis for this is your consent  (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Please refer to the information on the use  of cookies in this Privacy Policy. When you go to our application  page under
https://anydesk.com/en/career/jobs
and  click the "Apply Now" button, the IP address as well as the  information listed under "Log files" will be transferred to the  server of the third-party provider and you will be forwarded to  our current job offers on their server. The legal basis for this  is § 26 BDSG in conjunction with Art. 88 GDPR, as well as (for  the implementation of pre-contractual measures) Art. 6 (1) (b)  GDPR. For more information, please refer to "Job offers and  application process".
Protection of the website
We use the "Wordfence Security" service to protect our website  from viruses and malware and to fend off attacks by computer  criminals. IP addresses are stored on the third-party servers, in  particular, to protect against so-called brute-force and DDoS  attacks. IP addresses classified as harmless are placed on a  white list. The protection of our website and its users  constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6  (1) (f) GDPR. In addition, the plugin uses cookies to recognize  whether the visitor of our website is a human or a robot. In this  respect, please refer to the information on the use of cookies in  this Privacy Policy. The Live Traffic View option of the plugin  is disabled as it is not mandatory.
Multilingual design
We also use the multilingual WPML plugin in order to offer you  our website in different languages. The design of our website  that is comprehensible for as many users as possible constitutes  a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.  For this purpose, when you visit our website, WPML sets a cookie  in order to store the language setting you have selected. In this  respect, please refer to the information on the use of cookies in  this Privacy Policy.
SEO
We use the YOAST SEO plugin to support the search engine  optimization of our website. This plugin ensures the technical  optimization of our website for search engines while supporting  us in the development of content on our website. This is done to  make sure that customer groups interested in our offers can  easier find us on the Internet, which is a legitimate interest  within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The plugin uses  cookies. In this respect, please refer to the information on the  use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Web analysis
For the evaluation of visitor flows on our website, we may  record the behavior, interests or demographic information of the  users of our website as pseudonymous values. Based on this  audience analysis, we can, for example, identify under which IP  address, at what time and from where certain contents of our  website or its functions are most frequently accessed, or invite  the user to use them again. This also allows us to better  understand which functions or content of our website require  optimization (because they are not accessed as often or not at  all). For this purpose, we create and store user profiles in a  file (a so-called cookie), or we may use similar procedures with  the same purpose.
On the one hand, to protect the users, we use a so-called IP  masking procedure (pseudonymization by shortening the IP address)  when storing the users' IP addresses. On the other hand, in the  context of web analysis and optimization, no real user ID data is  stored (i.e. neither email addresses nor names), but strictly  pseudonyms. Therefore, we do not know the actual identity of the  users. We use the stored data exclusively for the aforementioned  purposes in their pseudonymous user profiles. With regard to the  legal basis and the individual opt-out options, please refer to  the information on the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Online marketing
User profiles can be created and stored in a file (cookie) to  display advertising content or to market advertising space  (online marketing). These data can be used to determine the  users' potential interests and to measure the effectiveness of  online marketing. The stored data may include content accessed,  websites visited, online networks used, as well as communication  partners and technical information, such as the IP address, the  browser used, the computer system used, and information on usage  times. If users have consented to their location data being  collected, this data may also be processed.
The following shall also apply in the case of online  marketing: We use a so-called IP masking procedure  (pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) when storing IP  addresses. In the context of web analysis and optimization, no  real user ID data is stored (i.e. neither email addresses nor  names), but strictly pseudonyms.
Therefore, we do not know the actual identity of the users. We  use these stored data exclusively for the aforementioned purposes  in their pseudonymous user profiles. In exceptional cases, real  ID data may be assigned to the user profiles if the respective  user is a member of a social network whose online marketing  process we use and with whose providers the users have entered  into agreements (e.g. by giving consent during registration),  according to which the network may link the user profiles with  the aforementioned data.
Otherwise, we only have access to summarized information about  the success of our advertisements, i.e. we can measure which of  our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion  (i.e. to an inquiry or a contract with us).
In general, the data stored in the cookies (or using  comparable processes) may also be read on other websites (which  use the same online marketing process) and, in turn, may be  analyzed for the purpose of displaying content, supplemented with  further data if necessary, and stored on the server of the online  marketing process provider.
With regard to the legal basis for online marketing processes  and the individual opt-out options, please refer to the  information on the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.
Review procedures and widgets
We use the so-called review widgets on the AnyDesk website to  allow our customers to review providers and products, and for our  own quality management. In the process, a reference to the  results of the review of our products by customers offered by a  service provider named in there is integrated via a linked page  or image element. When the image element is called up, the  service provider's web server automatically saves the IP address  and the information listed under "Log files". Further personal  data may be transferred to the respective service provider if you  have decided to review our products according to their terms and  conditions.
This data processing takes place on the basis of Art. 6 (1)  (f) GDPR and is necessary to safeguard our legitimate interest in  transparent review management and to ensure that we only publish  reviews by users who can actually report on their own experiences  as our customers and users of our products.
Customer Relationship Management
We use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to  maintain our customer relationships as part of our online  presence. They help us to effectively systematize, manage and  document product-relevant information offers and communication  with our customers. This is done using software solutions which  integrate the following aspects when using our website:
Contact management
Email marketing
Social media publishing
Web analysis
Online marketing
Registration services (our user account my.anydesk.com)
Customer review management
With regard to the legal basis and the individual opt-out  options, please refer to the information on the aforementioned  topics and the services used in this Privacy Policy.
In the case that you are already a registered customer of  AnyDesk, the Web Analysis and Online Marketing services may  contain specific information about your customer, contact and  contract information that shall be linked with your account. The  legal basis for the use of this personal data is our legitimate  interests in improving our website to make it easier for the  customers to use it and to provide additional information and  offers pertaining to our services (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
Content Delivery Network
In order to deliver the content of our website, i.e. also large  media files (such as graphics, videos or program scripts) to you  faster and more securely, we use regionally distributed servers  of a so-called Content Delivery Network (CDN), which are  connected via the Internet. In doing so, we establish a  connection to the server of the CDN service provider and transfer  your IP address there. If you are signed in with an existing user  account with this service provider while visiting our website,  this service provider can also associate your visit to our  website with your user behavior. The legal basis for the use of a  CDN and the associated data transfer are our legitimate interests  in improving our website to make it easier for the customers to  use it (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
In addition, the service provider can send further cookies to  your browser. In this respect, please refer to the information on  the use of cookies in this Privacy Policy.

Parts of these data are also processed in order to analyze  whether and on which connection path your device is available for  connection to other devices.
When the remote data connection takes place between the  connection partners, the session data are transferred to the  software client of the other connection partner via our master  server and (taking into account, in particular, the locations and  the current load) certain routing servers. AnyDesk itself does  not access these session data. We store the following usage data  for the purposes also mentioned in here (existing data will be  overwritten):

We may also contact you via in-app messages, in compliance  with the legal requirements, if the communication is necessary  for the purposes of administration or use of the application, or  to inform you about changes or improvements to our products or  completely new products, to invite you to participate in surveys,  or to give you tips on how to get the most out of our products.  For this purpose, we will process the above-mentioned usage data  as well as
your customer ID
. In the course of  deciding whether and how we should contact and inform you, we  will also process the type of license you have, the language and  version of the product you are using and/or your country, and we  may also use data that we have collected through web  analysis.
The data processing necessary for the verification of the  usage authorization and the provision of the functionalities of  the application itself serves to fulfill contractual obligations  (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR). In addition, we process data if this is  required to secure the application or protect our legitimate  business interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR; e.g. collection of data  for the purpose of optimizing the application, or for security  purposes). Otherwise, data will only be processed to the extent  to which you as the user have expressly given your consent (Art.  6 (1) (a) GDPR).
Please note that the opt-out or revocation of the respective  authorizations may affect the functionality of our  application.
Google Speech-to-Text
In our app you will find the Google Speech-to-Text function. This is operated by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereinafter "Google").
This function is used to compose voice messages and send them to the Google Cloud for conversion into character strings.
The Google Speech-to-Text function is provided as an option.
Data is therefore only transmitted to Google when you press the microphone icon. This activates the microphone you are using and you now have the option of converting the spoken language into text.
Purpose
The purpose is to enable a more comfortable and user-friendly use of our app.
By converting the spoken words and sentences into text through Google Speech-to-Text, the processes are accelerated and simplified.
Legal basis
The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) f) DSGVO.
Our legitimate interest is to improve the functionality and usability of our app.
Recipients of the data
If you activate the microphone icon and make a voice input, Google receives the spoken sentence in order to convert it into text.
Google does not make the audio sent to the Speech-to-Text API available to anyone except as necessary to provide the Speech-to-Text API service. For example, it may be necessary to engage a third-party provider to provide some aspects of Google's services, such as data storage or transmission. In these cases, that provider is subject to contractual obligations of security and confidentiality. Google does not share your audio content with other parties for any other purpose.
Storage period
AnyDesk does not store your data as part of the Speech-to-Text function. Your data is passed directly to Google for conversion.
By default, Google does not log a customer's audio data or transcripts.
Google uses customer data to optimise and improve the speech recognition service, only if you sign up for the data logging program.
AnyDesk has chosen not to enroll in the data logging program in order to protect your personal data.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Google may retain audio files.
Provision mandatory or required
The provision of your personal data is voluntary and is not required by law or contract. However, without the data transfer to Google-Speech-to-Text, a conversion of your spoken language into text is not possible.
Objection
Please read the information about your right to object according to Art. 21 DSGVO below.
You can find more detailed information about data processing by Google in the Google Privacy Notice:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
and more detailed information about the Google Speech-to-Text function here:
https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text?hl=en
Telemetry-Data
Nature and purpose of processing
We collect and aggregate user telemetry data in connection with the provision of our services for the following purposes:
Evaluating interactions:
From the analysis on the use of the program interface and functions, insights can be gained into the acceptance of AnyDesk's graphical components and functionalities, so that areas with potential for optimization can be better identified in the context of further product development and the user experience can be improved.
Licenses and scamming
When using the free version of AnyDesk, usage data is reviewed to determine whether the user's behaviour patterns are in accordance with our “AnyDesk Free” Supplementary Terms and Conditions, see the section entitled "Automatic Decision Making (License Audit)".
Usage data is analysed to detect potential scamming cases at an early stage.
Evaluation of system data
Which hardware is used when AnyDesk software is in use provides us with important information for support purposes, for example, in the event of client-side performance problems. In addition, this information is used for further product development with regard to system modifications.
Type of data
Version of client, client ID, IP address, operating system, zone of relay (continent, later country), license, license name, network ID, first login, last login, user_identifier (user) hashed, information about interactions: Timestamp of interaction, message counter,
Category of interaction: click, drag, drop, etc.
Identifier for interaction: login, frontend, click events, undraggable, auto-update, etc., which window e.g. settings or window for file transfer (within the software).
Legal basis
The processing of telemetry data is based on the user's consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.
Storage period
The data will only be processed as long as your consent is given or for 2 years.
Provision mandatory or required
This consent is voluntary. If it is not given, you will not have any disadvantages. This consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
Revocation of consent
The revocation of consent is possible at any time with effect for the future and can be done by using the deactivation button.
Automated decision making
see paragraph -
"Automated decision making (license audit)"
.
Automatic decision making (license audit)
We offer personal users of our licensed products (i.e.  exclusively for uses that cannot be attributed to commercial or  self-employed professional activity) the option of a free  version, which can be used without setting up a user account  after simply downloading the application. In this case, we may  analyze your usage data (see above under "Applications") in line  with our "AnyDesk Free" Supplementary Terms and Conditions in  order to be able to assess whether your behavior pattern aligns  with the contractual purpose of use and thus to the selected  license type (license audit).
If, based on the results of this analysis, a fee-based license  is required, we reserve the right to restrict or even block your  access to our server services and we will ask you to purchase a  fee-based license. This takes place in an automated  decision-making process according to our system settings. You can  contact our Support at any time to ask us to reassess your user  behavior. We will inform you beforehand which information you  will need to provide.
The automated decision-making process as part of the license  audit and the use of automated mechanisms based on it (such as  the restriction or blocking of non-contractual uses) is essential  for the effective control of compliance and, if necessary, the  enforcement of our license terms with regard to the considerable  number of users of the free version of our application. Since the  use of the free version can only be financed through paid usage  relationships, this automated decision-making process is  necessary to fulfill our contractual services for private users,  as it must be effectively ensured that all users use our  application within the contractually agreed license scope. The  legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR in conjunction with  Art. 22 (2) (a) GDPR.
Social networks
Our company maintains an online presence within various social  networks (social media). We process data of active users of these  social networks in order to communicate with them there or to  offer information about AnyDesk. This processing takes place on  the basis of our legitimate interests in effective information  for users and communication with users under the applicable  framework conditions of the respective social medium in  accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. If you, as a user of the  respective social medium, are asked to give your consent to data  processing (e.g. by ticking a check box), the legal basis for  processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.
If it is technically possible for us to influence the  processing operations relevant to the data protection regulations  of the respective social media you have accessed, we will do so  in the sense of data minimization within the meaning of Art. 5  (1) (c) GDPR. However, please note that your use of the  respective social networks is subject to their terms and  conditions and data processing guidelines. Therefore, it cannot  be ruled out that your data may also be processed outside the  European Union. On the one hand, this could make it more  difficult to enforce your rights. On the other hand, the data  collected when using the functionalities of the social networks  may also be analyzed and processed for market research and  advertising purposes. This is done by storing your usage behavior  and the resulting interests and preferences as usage profiles in  cookies and by placing advertisements based on these profiles  inside and outside the social networks that presumably match your  interests (online marketing). If you as a user are also a member  of the respective social networks and are signed in to them, the  usage profiles may also store data that are independent of those  of the end devices you are using.
Information and notes on the respective forms of processing  and the opt-out options can be found in the privacy policies and  details of the operators of the respective networks. Since only  the respective operators of the social networks have access to  the data processed by them, you would also need to make requests  for information in this regard and assert your rights as a data  subject with them. We will be more than happy to help you if you  need our support in this regard.

Job offers and application process
As part of our application process, it is necessary for  applicants to provide us with the data required for their  professional assessment and selection. Which data this is in the  individual case can be seen from the respective job advertisement  or from the information provided in the relevant online forms.  When you apply for a job offer, we usually process the following  categories of personal data:
Contact information:
First and last name (title, if applicable)
Address
Phone number
Email address
Qualification-related information, in particular:
Academic achievements and other information contained in the    curriculum vitae, including information on prices and    scholarships and extracurricular achievements, information on    dissertation projects, information on education and professional    experience
Copies of diplomas and certificates
Photos attached to an application, if applicable
Information on (possibly only planned or hoped for) further    education and other career steps as well as professional focuses    and interests, if applicable
We collect these data directly from you and only process them  to the extent necessary for the application process. The legal  basis for this processing is § 26 BDSG in conjunction with Art.  88 GDPR, as well as (for the implementation of pre-contractual  measures with regard to freelancers) Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. The  data will be encrypted and transferred to us in accordance with  the latest state of the art. Please note that we may use  third-party services for the purpose of searching for and  selecting applicants (e.g. applicant management or recruitment  software and platforms). The legal basis for this is our  legitimate interest in an efficient and transparent job  advertisement (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR; please also refer to the  information in "Data recipients").
During the application process, special categories of personal  data within the meaning of Art. 9 (1) GDPR (e.g. health data,  such as severe impairment or ethnic origin) are processed only  for the purpose of exercising the obligations or rights arising  to us or the data subject from labor law and social security and  social protection law (Art. 9 (2) (b) GDPR), and otherwise to  protect the vital interests of applicants or other persons  according to Art. 9 (2) (c) GDPR or for health care or  occupational medicine purposes, for assessing the employee's  ability to work, for medical diagnostics, for care or treatment  in the health or social sector, or for the administration of  systems and services in the health or social sector in accordance  with Art. 9 (2) (h) GDPR. In the case of a notification of the  special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their  processing is based on Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR.
Duration of storage
Personal data is stored as long as processing is necessary  for the purposes described under "Categories of data" unless you  have expressly given us your consent for a longer storage period  (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR), or unless statutory provisions prescribe a  longer storage period (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR). As far as the data  subject to the statutory retention periods, we store this data in  our systems until the statutory retention periods have expired  (these are generally 6 or 10 years for reasons of proper  bookkeeping and tax law requirements).
We will inform you if we use the services of third-party  providers or platforms to provide our services, since the  relationship between you as a user of these services and the  respective providers will then be governed by their terms and  conditions and privacy policies (and thus possibly different  storage periods). It is the responsibility of the contractual  partner to secure their data when the storage period expires  (e.g. if the customer account is terminated).
With regard to email addresses provided by you to receive  newsletters, the following shall apply as well: We store deleted  email addresses for up to three years on the basis of our  legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to  prove a previously given consent (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). The  processing of this data is limited to the purpose of possible  defense against claims. An individual request for deletion may be  made at any time provided that the previous existence of consent  is confirmed at the same time. In the event of obligations to  take due account of objections, we reserve the right to store the  email address in a blacklist (so-called "blocklist") for this  purpose alone.
In addition, the following shall apply with regard to the  application process:
Unless the application has led to the commencement of  employment with us, the personal data collected via our job  portal or by other means for the purposes of the application  process will be further processed for a maximum of three years  after the process has been completed (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) for  evidence preservation purposes, after which they will be deleted  or anonymized. The application process itself is considered  completed no later than three months after receipt of your  application.
Upon termination of the contractual relationship with customer  data, all information relating to the user account will be  deleted, subject to a statutory retention period. It is the  responsibility of the users to back up their data before the end  of the contract. We are entitled to irretrievably delete all user data stored during the term of the contract.
Data recipients
We will only pass on your data to third parties in compliance  with the statutory provisions to the extent that this
a. is necessary for the purposes described under "Categories  of data",
b. is necessary to fulfill legal obligations, or
c. takes place with your consent as a data subject.
If the transfer or disclosure of the data takes place on our  behalf for the execution of data processing processes that are  earmarked for a specific purpose or subject to consent according  to (a) above, we will enter into suitable contracts or agreements  with the recipients of the data (processors) which serve to  protect your data (
Art.    28    GDPR
).
Recipients of this data can be:
Telecommunications companies
(Technical and organizational) auxiliary service    providers
Subcontractors
Banks
Tax and legal advisers
Web hosting providers
IT service providers
Providers of product review procedures
Payment service providers
Providers of online application tools
Providers of web analysis, online marketing or CRM    services
Providers of survey tools
Cloud services
Tax authorities
We may transfer personal data to affiliated companies of our  group of companies or grant them access to this data. If this  transfer takes place for administrative purposes, the transfer of  the data is based on our legitimate business and commercial  interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or takes place if it is necessary  to fulfill our contractual obligations (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR), or  if the consent of the data subject (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or legal  permission (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR) has been obtained.
Subject to your express consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or a  transfer required by contract (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR) or by law  (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR), your personal data will only be processed  in third countries (i.e. outside the European Union or the  European Economic Area) with a recognized level of data  protection, a contractual obligation through so-called standard  protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the presence of  certifications or binding internal data protection regulations,  by us or on our behalf (Art. 44 to 49 GDPR).
Please also refer to the information page of the EU  Commission:
