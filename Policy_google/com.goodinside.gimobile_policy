We may transfer or disclose your personal information to a recipient in a country outside the UK/EEA (third country), which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to that in the UK/EEA. In particular, we may transfer your personal information to service providers, or they may transfer personal information to us or to other service providers within the United States, which has not been deemed to provide adequate protection by the UK government, the European Commission or the Swiss data protection authority. Similarly, if you opt-in to cookies on our Site, your personal information will be shared with third parties in the United States. In such cases, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards have been taken (for example, by entering into data transfer agreements using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses and UK Information Commissioner (ICO) approved Addendum), to provide adequate protection for your personal information.

Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Information.
Right to access

Right to correct
- we will take steps in accordance with applicable legislation to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. You are entitled to have any inadequate, incomplete, or incorrect personal information corrected (that is, rectified) or completed.
Right to withdraw consent
- in the event your personal information is processed on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Data portability
- where we are relying (as the legal basis for processing) upon your consent, or the fact that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract, and the personal information is processed by automated means, you have the right to receive all such personal information which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.
Right to erasure
- you are entitled to have your personal information erased under specific circumstances, such as where you have withdrawn your consent, where you object to processing based on legitimate interests and we have no overriding legitimate grounds (see below), or where personal information is unlawfully processed.
Right to restriction of processing
- you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information (that is, allow only its storage) where:
you contest the accuracy of the personal information, until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;
where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal information;
where we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require such personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims; or

Right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds -
where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process personal information, you have the right to object to that processing based on grounds related to your personal situation. If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing, we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.

Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Information.
Right to access
- you have the right to request access to and a copy of any of your personal information that we hold, and to obtain information about the processing of that data.
Right to correct
- we will take steps in accordance with applicable legislation to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. You are entitled to have any inadequate, incomplete, or incorrect personal information corrected (that is, rectified) or completed.
Right to withdraw consent
- in the event your personal information is processed on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Data portability
- where we are relying (as the legal basis for processing) upon your consent, or the fact that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract, and the personal information is processed by automated means, you have the right to receive all such personal information which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.
Right to erasure
- you are entitled to have your personal information erased under specific circumstances, such as where you have withdrawn your consent, where you object to processing based on legitimate interests and we have no overriding legitimate grounds (see below), or where personal information is unlawfully processed.
Right to restriction of processing
- you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information (that is, allow only its storage) where:
you contest the accuracy of the personal information, until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;
where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal information;
where we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require such personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims; or
where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below), pending verification as to whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
Right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds -
where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process personal information, you have the right to object to that processing based on grounds related to your personal situation. If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing, we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.
Right to object to direct marketing (including profiling)
-
you have the right to object to our use of your personal information (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use your personal information to invite you to our promotional events.
You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us by clicking on the opt-out or ‘unsubscribe’ link included in the marketing e-mails you receive.
If you opt out of receiving promotional emails, we may still send you emails about your account, membership or any services you have requested or received from us.
Please contact us at
support@goodinside.com
if you wish to exercise any of your rights, or if you have any enquiries or complaints regarding the processing of your personal information.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your habitual residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes applicable law. The authority for the UK is the ICO, available at

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
