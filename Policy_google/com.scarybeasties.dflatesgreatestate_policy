3. What is Personal Data?
Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’.
Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.
The Personal Data that Scary Beasties uses is set out in Part 5, below.
4. What Are My Rights?
Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:
The right to be informed about our collection and use of your Personal Data. This Privacy Notice should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using the details in Part 11.
The right to access the Personal Data we hold about you. Part 10 will tell you how to do this.
The right to have your Personal Data rectified if any of your Personal Data held by us is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact us using the details in Part 11 to find out more.
The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your Personal Data that we have. Please contact us using the details in Part 11 to find out more.
The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your Personal Data.
The right to object to us using your Personal Data for a particular purpose or purposes.
The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided Personal Data to us directly, we are using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that Personal Data to re-use with another service or business in many cases. We do not use your Personal Data in this way.
Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. We do not use your Personal Data in this way.
For more information about our
use of your Personal Data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact us using the details provided in Part 11.
Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ico.org.uk)
If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your Personal Data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.
5. What Personal Data Do You Collect?
The following Scary Beasties applications collect Personal Data:
Clods Wallup iOS and Android game

Clods Wallup is a free-to-play game that generates revenue by serving targeted advertisements to players. These advertisements are enabled through our use of third-party software provided by a company called Unity.
To use its services, Unity requires the collection of Personal Data from your device as a default setting. Among other things, this may include Unique Device Identifiers, an IP address and information about your make and model of device. Scary Beasties itself does not store this data and cannot access it.
Unity allows you to set your preferences about the Personal Data Unity collects by tapping on the Data Privacy icon or “i” button which can be found on any Unity advertisement that you see. Unity provide further information in the
Unity Privacy Policy
and in the
Unity GDPR FAQs
as follows:
“
How are players able to opt-out of data collection?
When a player sees an ad served through Unity, there is a privacy icon that links to view her privacy settings.
Within these settings the player can opt-out or modify her preferences, and also view the Unity Privacy Policy. This appears on the end card of each ad they see in each game.
What happens if a player opts-out of data collection?
The player’s data is deleted and the player only sees non-targeted ads or ads based solely on contextual data.”

Privacy Policy

Your Personal Data will be used for the following purposes:
Supplying our
support services to you. Your personal details are required in order for us to correspond with you regarding any issues or questions you may have regarding the apps for which we supply support services.

Other than as described herein or as required by law, we will not use your Personal Data for marketing purposes and we will not pass on your Personal Data to any third party.
7. How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?
We will not keep your Personal Data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. Your Personal Data will therefore be kept for the following period:

Personal data supplied in writing will be filed and stored in a secure place at Scary Beasties’ offices or in secure off site storage.
9. Do You Share My Personal Data?
We
will not share any of your Personal Data with any third parties for any purpose, subject to two important exceptions:
In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain Personal Data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.
Where we supply application support services to a third party publisher and you have contacted us in relation to this service, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in order to deal effectively with your query or issue.
In relation to the applications specified in Section 5 above, the Unity software that is embedded in our application allows Unity to collect Personal Data.
10. How Can I Access My Personal Data?
If you want to know what Personal Data we have about you, you can ask us
for details of that Personal Data and for a copy of it (where any such Personal Data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.
All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 11.
We
will respond to your subject access request within as short a time frame as possible and in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your Personal Data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.
In relation to Personal Data stored by Unity via an application specified in Section 5, please follow the instructions described by Unity as to how to delete your Personal Data as follows:
