			the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.

2.1. “Registration and Account Data”
When you install the Service on your device and/or register for an account with LivU, personally and/or non-personally 
			identifiable information about you may be collected. There are two types of Registration and Account Data; data:-
Information you provide (mandatory) - You will be asked to provide your gender, name or an alias and date of birth

			friends features in our Service.

			your photos or videos of yourself, description of yourself and information about your interests. For example you can 
			indicate your interests in your profile page.  The provision of such information is entirely optional. If you register 
			and log in using your Facebook, Apple or Google account, we may also collect additional information that you make available 
			to us. For example, if you register with LivU using your Facebook account (e.g., Facebook Connect), we may collect and store 
			your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers for automatic log in and profile information and, if you give us your 
			express consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make available on Facebook (for example, 
			your first and last names, email address, profile picture, birthdays). We will store it on our servers and use it to facilitate 
			your use of the Service – for example - we may synchronize your LivU account between different devices which you may use to access 
			our Service.
We also use your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow – for example if there are new 
			offerings for our Services or updates regarding changes to our Services and to help others find your account if your 
			settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. You can use your settings for email 
			and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from us. You can also unsubscribe from a notification by 
			following the instructions contained within the notification.
In addition to the video calling features you can use our personal text messaging service as part of the Services in the App.

			 and information related to them. This includes scanning for malicious content, detection of abuse and prohibited images, 
			 and use of reported issues. We also use information about whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of
