Our Commitment to Privacy.
As a global LGTBQ+ social networking application, the Grindr Properties allow you to share information about yourself with us, Grindr's service providers who help us provide our Properties, and other Grindr users, including your precise location and information that may be deemed "sensitive" or "special category" in certain jurisdictions such as ethnicity, information about your sex life, sexual preferences, or your self-reported health information. Our goal is to put you in control of as much of the Personal Information that you share within the Grindr Properties as possible. We recommend you read this Privacy and Cookie Policy and our
Terms and Conditions of Service
carefully. To support our commitment to continued transparency, in addition to regular updates to this Policy, within the Grindr Services you will see occasional pop-up privacy notices meant to help you understand what you are participating in when you choose to use certain features or services.
Grindr LLC is a U.S.-based Company.
By using the Grindr Properties, you are transmitting information to Grindr in the United States and its service providers (in the United States and other third countries). If you are a resident of another country, note that the United States and other third countries may not afford the same privacy protections as your country of residence.
Permissible Age
. The Grindr Properties are intended only for users who are legal adults, generally eighteen (18) years of age and older. If you are aware that a child or minor has submitted Personal Information on the Grindr Properties, please contact us by either using the in-app reporting tool (click

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you use the Grindr Properties, we collect Personal Information about you, the majority of which you choose to provide. We may collect data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our Properties and receive information from third parties.
[LEARN MORE]
Personal Information You Are Required To Provide
. When you set up an account, we require that you provide limited Personal Information such as email or phone number and date of birth to validate that you are an adult.
Personal Information You Have The Option To Provide.
You have a choice about what Personal Information you provide as part of your public profile ("Grindr Profile"). Personal Information which you include in your Grindr Profile is referred to as your "Profile Information" and is shared with other users of the Grindr Services (the "Grindr Community"). For example, you may choose to share or not share location, HIV status, vaccination status, photos and videos. Note, however, that choosing not to provide certain information may impact the functionality of certain Grindr Services. You may also optionally provide Personal Information to us for feedback and customer support services or when you agree to participate in surveys. Such data varies from survey to survey.
Note on "sensitive" Personal Information.
In some jurisdictions and under some regulations, information that may reveal an individual's racial or ethnic origin, details on their health or sex life/sexual orientation, or precise geolocation, among other data, may be considered "sensitive" or "special category" Personal Information.
A note on location information.
We may collect your precise location ("Location") from your device to determine your distance from other users ("Distance Information") and display your profile on the Grindr Properties. Sophisticated users who use the Grindr Services in an unauthorized manner, or other users who change their location while you remain in the same location, may use Distance Information to determine your exact location and may be able to determine your identity. You may choose to hide your Distance Information; however, if you continue to use the Grindr Services the Grindr Services will continue to sort and display your profile based on your relative distance from other users. Accordingly, even if you choose to hide your Distance Information, others may nevertheless be able to determine your Location. You may revoke this permission and disable the location services on your device on an iPhone by going to Settings> Privacy> Location Services> Grindr; on an Android device by going to Settings> Location> Grindr> Permissions> Location; and on Grindr Web by adjusting your browser settings.
Personal Information We Receive From Your Device When You Use The Grindr Properties.

Your Additional Rights as a Colorado Resident.
In addition to the choices and rights outlined

Grindr does not share inferences based on “sensitive” Personal Information with advertising partners.
For residents of Virginia, Utah, Connecticut, Texas, Oregon
, New Hampshire, Delaware, Montana, Iowa, and New Jersey please refer to the “
Your Choices and Rights
” section of this Privacy Policy for your privacy rights.
Exercising Your Rights
Authorized Agents.
Grindr will accept requests from authorized agents on behalf of individuals who reside in a state that allows requests through an authorized agent. If you are an authorized agent for an individual who resides in a state that allows requests through an authorized agent, please click
here
to submit a request and attach a signed designation form from the individual that you represent authorizing you to serve as the individual's agent for the purposes of exercising the individual's rights under the applicable privacy law. Individuals can optionally notarize the document or provide a Power of Attorney document along with the signed designation form. If you do not provide the signed designation form, we cannot honor any requests you submit on behalf of the individual.
Appeals.
Depending on the state in which you reside, you may be able to appeal a decision made regarding your privacy request by submitting a request
here
. In the event we deny your appeal, you will provide a written explanation of the decision, and instructions on how to contact your local Attorney General, or relevant authority, for further review where permitted under certain U.S. state privacy laws.
Opt-Out Preference Signals.
Grindr will attempt to recognize and process opt-out preference signals in a seamless manner. In addition to opting out of the sale (or sharing for cross-contextual behavioral advertising) of your Personal Information via settings in the Grindr Services or submitting a request
here
, you can also opt-out by broadcasting an opt-out preference signal ("Signal"), such as the Global Privacy Control ("GPC") on a browser and/or a browser extension that support such a Signal. The ability to process your Signals may depend on the Grindr Properties that you are browsing:
If you are browsing Grindr Web (either on a mobile or web browser), your request to opt-out of sale via the Signal will be processed and linked to your account (i.e., the opt out will be in effect when you log in to the Grindr App).
If you are browsing a non-Grindr Services web domain (e.g., Grindr Site) or if you are not logged into your Grindr account (e.g., Grindr Web's landing page), your request to opt-out of sale via the Signal will be processed and linked to your browser identifier only (and not linked to your Grindr account because the connection between your browser and the account is not known to us).
If you are browsing the Grindr App, your request to opt-out of sale via the Signal will not be processed as Signals are currently only supported by browser experiences.
Do Not Track.
Some web browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, Grindr currently does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include "Do Not Track" instructions. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit

EMPLOYEE MONITORING
The work product of Grindr employees, whether in paper record, computer files, recorded communications, or in any other storage format, belongs to Grindr, and that work product, and the tools used to generate that work product, are always subject to review and monitoring by Grindr.
In the course of conducting our business, we may monitor employees' activities, online and within the workplace. For example, we have the capability to monitor all employees' use of workplace hardware, software and tools (e.g., laptop, email, and chat).
This section is not meant to suggest that all employees will in fact be monitored or their actions subject to constant surveillance. We have no duty to monitor. This is meant to bring to your attention that such monitoring may occur and may result in the collection of Personal Information from employees (e.g., through their use of company resources) and may be subject to use in accordance with this Privacy Policy. When using Grindr-specific equipment or Grindr resources (e.g., employer-provided network), employees should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to their use of such equipment or resources.
GRINDR EMPLOYEE USE OF GRINDR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Personal use of Grindr Services (as defined in the
Grindr Privacy and Cookie Policy
) by current employees and contractors is optional, although we welcome everyone to experience the app to better understand its function and features in the context of their employment with Grindr. Current employees or contractors may request upgrades to their personal Grindr accounts (e.g., Grindr Xtra or Grindr Unlimited). Personal Information required for an upgrade is the email address or account identifier associated with the Grindr account. Any normal course use of the Grindr Services by employees is governed by the
Grindr Privacy and Cookie Policy
.
HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
In some instances (i.e., on a conditional and need-to-know basis), Grindr may provide your Personal Information to employees, contractors, consultants, or service providers in order to fulfill our business needs or provide assistance or services to you directly (See “What We Do With Your Personal Information section”). Your Personal Information may also be provided under these specific circumstances:
As permitted or required by applicable law, rule, or regulatory requirements. In such a case, we will endeavor to not disclose more Personal Information than is required or appropriate under the circumstances;
To comply with valid legal processes, such as search warrants, subpoenas or court orders;
To protect the rights and property of Grindr;
During emergency situations or where necessary to protect the safety of a person or group of persons;
Where the Personal Information is publicly available (e.g., speaking at an event); or
With your consent where such consent is required by law.
Grindr does not sell In-Scope Individuals' Personal Information to third-parties.
HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Grindr retains your Personal Information for as long as is necessary to perform the business use cases listed in this Policy or to comply with federal, state, or local law.
YOUR CHOICES AND RIGHTS
In most cases, you have direct access to the systems Grindr uses to support the processing purposes above. Via such access, generally you'll be able to edit or delete your Personal Information yourself. Where your jurisdiction's law allows, you may also request access, edits, or deletions to your information that you're unable to access, delete or correct on your own by submitting a request through our website
here
