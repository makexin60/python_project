WHO WE ARE
We are Squeaky Dog Studios ("Squeaky Dog"), a software company comprised of a small team of developers headquartered in sunny San Diego, California. We develop unique mobile applications, watch faces, and games aimed at instilling joy and fun into your use of technology.
‍
SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This policy describes the practices of Squeaky Dog with respect to user information that we may collect or that you may provide to us when you download and use our mobile applications and games, including: PhotoWear, Unicorn Wear, Pride Time, Just A Minute, and Fast Factor (each an "App" or collectively, "Apps") including when you email or send other electronic communications to us through or in connection with the Apps, and when you visit or interact with our website
https://squeaky.dog
("Site"). This policy does not cover the personal information you submit to the app store provider from whom you download our Apps
(e.g.
your username, e-mail address, payment information, etc.). We play no part in the collection or processing of that data and do not have access to it.
Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with our practices as explained herein, please do not download or use our Apps or use our Site. If you have any questions about anything in this policy, feel free to reach out to us at
support@squeaky.dog
.
‍
SECTION 1: WHEN YOU USE OUR APPS
Summary
: We do not automatically collect personal information like your name, address, or e-mail address when you use our Apps. We only obtain that type of personal information when you give it to us. Depending on the privacy settings in your mobile device and the permissions you grant when using our Apps, however, we may collect certain information
about your device and your use of the Apps
. This information is not "personal" in the usual sense of the word - meaning it does not independently allow us to identify you – but it nonetheless may be considered "personal information" under the laws of certain jurisdictions. We do not sell your information or use it to serve you advertisements. We do, however, share the information with service providers in order to operate and improve our Apps, run our business, and provide you with product support.
‍
1.1 Information We Collect and How We Collect It
Information Necessary for Our Apps to Function ("Functional Data")
. To enable certain features or functionality of our Apps you may be required to grant the App access to specific data on or through your mobile device, including but not limited to:
Stored Information and Files.
Certain of our Apps may access files stored on your device (e.g. photographs), metadata and other information associated with those files. For example, in order to use PhotoWear or Just In Time to upload photos from your mobile device onto your smart watch, you will be required to grant the App access to your camera and/or your photos. We at Squeaky Dog, however, cannot access or view your photos they are only stored locally on your mobile device/smart watch.
Social media information.
In order to upload photos to PhotoWear from your Instagram account, you must login to Instagram from within the App. We at Squeaky Dog, however, cannot access or view this login information or your Instagram photos; they are only stored locally on your mobile device/smart watch.
Precise Geo-location Information.
If you have opted to utilize the weather display capability available in some of our Apps, your precise geo-location information is collected (subject to your permission) and sent to our servers along with your request for weather information. Our servers forward your request to weather data providers to obtain the best weather data available and then reply to the App with the requested weather data. An anonymous session id is utilized to enable this functionality –none of your personal information is shared with the weather data providers. We cache your location and weather data on our servers for a limited time for functional reasons, but we do not associate the location or data with any particular user or device.
Analytics and Crash Data.
In all of our Apps except Fast Factor, we use two Google services –Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics - to track and measure certain data about the way users interact with and use our Apps and to discover and fix technical issues such as crashes. Firebase Analytics helps us understand who (generally) is using our Apps and how they are being used. The information collected and transmitted to us by Firebase Analytics includes but is not limited to:
Information about your mobile device, including: the device identifier (
i.e.
Android Advertising ID), the model, manufacturer, operating system name and version, and a truncated IP address (to mask the IP address and prevent it from being traced back to a particular user);
Information about your usage and the functioning of the App, including, for example, the store from which the App was downloaded, when the app was first used after being downloaded, when the App is updated, when you accept permissions requested by the App;
General demographic information, including your age range (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+); whether you are male or female; the language setting on your device; and the country in which you are located.
You can read more about how Firebase Analytics work here:
Google Analytics for Firebase Data Collection
Firebase Crashlytics provides us information about crashes and malfunctions that occur during the use of our Apps. The information collected and transmitted to us in the case of a crash or malfunction includes but is not limited to: device-specific information (
e.g.
model and operating system version) and crash and error traces. This data allows us to track, prioritize, and fix stability issues and bugs within the Apps and improve their function. You can read more about how Crashlytics works here:
Firebase Crashlytics
Information You Provide to Us
. The personal information you provide directly to us may vary based on the reason for your communication. For example, you may want to contact us with a question or request App support, post on our social media channels, respond to a survey, participate in a contest or other promotion, sign-up for our mailing list, and other such similar activity. Generally, the personal information we collect in these types of instances might include:
Contact information and personal identifiers such as your name, email address, or phone number;
Records and copies of your correspondence (including email addresses and phone numbers), if you contact us;
Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete;
User content, such as comments, reviews, images, audio, video or other content you post or provide to us.
‍
1.2 How We Use Information We Collect Through Our Apps
We use Functional Data to enable you to utilize certain features or functions of our Apps. We use Analytics and Crash data to operate and improve our Apps; provide technical support and maintenance for our Apps; and perform statistical analysis about the use of our Apps. We use the personal information you voluntarily provide to us to respond to your requests, questions, and feedback and to provide you with technical support. We also use this information to communicate with you about the Apps, including by sending you announcements, updates, and security alerts, and marketing and promotional communications that you have requested to receive.
If it becomes necessary, we may use your personal information and disclose it to law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties as we believe necessary or appropriate to: (a) protect our, your, or others' rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims); (b) enforce the End User License Agreement applicable to the App; (c) protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity; and (d) comply with a court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
‍
1.3 Who We Share Your Information With
We may disclose user information (including personal information) that we collect or you provide to the third parties identified below.
Service Providers
. We may share your personal information with contractors and service providers that perform services on our behalf or help us operate the Apps (such as customer support, analytics, and email delivery providers) and provide you with great customer service.
For example, in utilizing Analytics and Crashlytics, we share data with Google, as described in:
How Google Uses Information from Sites or Apps that use our Services
We also use Mailchimp to manage email marketing subscriber lists and send emails to our subscribers. Read
their privacy policy
.
Third-party platforms and social media networks
. If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the App to a third-party platform or social media network (such as by logging into Instagram through the App), we may disclose the personal information that you have authorized us to share with them by enabling the feature or function (such as when you elect to download a photograph from your Instagram account to your mobile device). We do not control the third-party platforms' use of your personal information, including whether they track your online activities over time and across different websites; this is governed by that third party's privacy policy and terms and conditions. For example, if you choose to connect to Instagram from within PhotoWear, this connection is enabled through our use of the Instagram API and is subject to the
Instagram privacy policy
.
Professional advisors
. We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.
A buyer or other successor to our company.
We may disclose your personal information to a buyer of or other successor to our company in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Squeaky Dog's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Squeaky Dog about our App users is among the assets transferred.
Compliance, legal, fraud prevention and safety purposes.
We may disclose your personal information as necessary to address the legal, fraud prevention and safety matters as described in Section 1.2.
We may also disclose, without restriction, aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual or device.
‍
1.4 Your Choices
Functional Data:
The Functional Data is collected pursuant to express permissions you grant when you install our Apps or when you seek to use certain App features. If you do not want us to collect this information, do not download our App (or delete it from your mobile device), and/or do not enable specific features or functions that require the collection of this data. You may revoke any permissions you previously granted to us, such as permission to access your camera, camera roll, etc. through the settings on your mobile device. Of course, if you revoke permissions that are necessary for the functioning of the App, you will not be able to use the App or the relevant features of the App.
Analytics and Crash Data
: If you do not want us to collect Analytics and Crashlytics information, certain of our Apps may provide you with an option to opt-out via a specific prompt or through the privacy settings within the App. If the App does not provide for an opt-out and you do not want this data collected, you should stop using the App and remove it from your mobile device.
Information You Provide to Us
: You are in control with respect to what information you choose to voluntarily share with us. If you require App support, we may require certain information to respond to or fulfill your request. It's up to you whether you want to provide the requested information. If you have signed up for our mailing list but want to discontinue receiving communications from us, you may "unsubscribe" through the link provided in our emails. You may continue to receive emails with transactional or relationship content, and other non-marketing emails.
‍
1.5 Notice to European and UK Users
The information provided in this "Notice to European and UK Users" section applies only to individuals who are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") and the United Kingdom ("UK") and supplements and should be read in conjunction with the other information in this privacy policy.
Personal information
. References to "personal information" in this privacy policy are equivalent to "personal data" as defined in European data protection legislation.
Controller
. Squeaky Dog is the controller of your personal information covered by this policy for purposes of European data protection legislation.
Legal bases for processing
. We use your personal information only as permitted by law. Our legal bases for processing the personal information described in this privacy policy will depend on the information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We will, however, normally collect and use personal information from you when the processing of the information is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms or based on your consent.
Our legitimate interests are described in more detail in this privacy policy in Sections 1.1. and 1.2 above, but they typically include providing, maintaining and improving our Apps, providing customer support, and performing statistical analysis. Your ability to withdraw your consent is explained above in Section 1.4 of this privacy policy.
Cross Border Transfers
. Squeaky Dog and the servers used to host the Apps are located in the United States. Personal information of any individuals from outside the United States, including those in the EEA and UK, may therefore be transmitted to and stored on servers in the United States. We also use service providers that are located in the U.S. (but that also operate outside of the U.S.) to whom we may provide access to personal information where it is necessary or advisable to maintain our Apps or to effectively run our business. In those cases, we have processing agreements with standard contractual clauses with the service providers that are designed to ensure the proper and secure handling of the personal information.
Your rights
. European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information. If you are located within the European Union, you may ask us to take certain actions in relation to your personal information that we hold as specified below.
Access

You may submit these requests by email to
support@squeaky.dog
. Please note, however, that while certain device or usage information may be considered "personal data" under European law, Squeaky Dog does not actively attempt to link such data to any person, and if such information is requested, we may not have sufficient information available to provide you with secure, authenticated access to that data or to confirm that specific data relates to you.
Security
. We maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal information in our hosted applications from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We cannot, however, ensure the security of any information you transmit through our Apps or guarantee that information on the App may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
Please do your part to help us keep your information secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of information on the mobile devices on which you use our Apps and for controlling access to communications between you and Squeaky Dog. Your privacy settings and third party use of your personal information may also be affected by linking social media networks (e.g. Instagram) to the use of our Apps. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any organization other than Squeaky Dog.
Retention
. We retain your personal information for as long as required to provide the services requested by you, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce the terms for our Apps. How long this is depends on several factors, including why and when we first collected the information and whether there is a legal or other business reason for us to keep it. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain information about you, we will dispose of it securely or anonymize the information.
Contact Information
. Please email us at
support@squeaky.dog
if you have questions or need further information concerning your rights or the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information. You may also contact us there if would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal information or our response to your requests.
You may also submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction, but we would appreciate it if you gave us the opportunity to resolve any issues first. You can find your data protection regulator
here

Intuit Global Privacy Statement
Last Updated: September 8, 2024
See previous Privacy Statements
Expand All
Collapse All
Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role
Intuit responsibly leverages technology to power prosperity around the world. We believe that everyone has a right to privacy. As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (
“Privacy Statement”
) to explain how we, Intuit Inc. and the
Intuit group companies
(collectively
“Intuit,” “we,” “us,” or “our”
), collect, use, share, or otherwise process information that we collect through our services. These services include, as applicable, our websites, mobile applications, social media pages, marketing activities, and other activities described in this Privacy Statement, or when other businesses provide us your personal information (collectively, the
“Services”
). This Privacy Statement is global, meaning it applies to all Intuit Services. We may provide additional or supplemental privacy statements for certain products or services.
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices when we process:
Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “
Tax Preparation Information
”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;
Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of our websites and the Intuit platform, which includes all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) other than Tax Preparation Information (the “
Intuit Platform
”); and
Personal information as necessary to manage, run, improve, and develop our business and personalize your experience while interacting with the Intuit Platform. Depending on your settings, this may include showing you personalized ads or recommending certain Intuit products based on your interests.
Intuit determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement, and therefore acts as a ‘data controller’ (or equivalent/similar terms under applicable data privacy laws) of such information. We may share your personal information within the
Intuit group companies
and conduct processing activities as controllers or joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
In certain circumstances, there may be more than one data controller processing your personal information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as a data controller. In these situations, we act as an independent data controller over our processing activities. This means we determine how your personal information will be processed independently from the other data controllers. The other data controllers have their own obligations under applicable data privacy laws. Intuit is not responsible for other data controllers’ processing activities, and you should contact them directly for questions about how they process your personal information and about how to exercise your privacy rights in relation to such processing.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to certain processing activities where we are not the controller. For example, where Intuit processes personal information as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, including when we process personal information on behalf of customers of our professional tax software products. When we act as a processor or service provider, the privacy statement of the customer who uses our Services applies, instead of this Privacy Statement, and our processing of such personal information is governed by our agreements with such customers. If you have concerns about personal information that we process on behalf of a customer, or wish to exercise your privacy rights regarding such personal information, please contact the customer directly.
This Privacy Statement also does not apply to Intuit Financial Services or Intuit’s processing of education records subject to state or federal laws or children’s data in our education curriculum products. You may find the privacy statement for Intuit Financial Services
here
, and the privacy statement for Intuit for Education
here
.
If you have any questions about how Intuit processes your personal information, please see How to contact us below.
The Intuit platform
The Intuit Platform and your personal information
When we say “platform,” we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), Intuit uses that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you’re using. This means that, for example, we may use your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, contact and purchase history details from Mailchimp, and/or recommendations from Credit Karma. The personal information we use in this centralized way may relate to you as an end user of our Services or as a customer or vendor of an Intuit customer whose personal information has been included in the Intuit Platform.
Business account information
Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with a business (such as your employer). If you are granted access to a business account (for example, in QuickBooks), the business owner or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights; making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll); or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift). If the owner or designated administrator changes your access rights, then you may lose access to the information the business controls.
Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of a business account may be subject to the business’s policies, which may differ from this Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other businesses, and you should consider both the business’s policies and whether you are comfortable giving the business access to your personal information before connecting to their services.
Personal information we collect
The personal information that we collect or otherwise receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account, and the choices you make, including your privacy settings. The way we process your personal information may also depend on the particular Services, functionalities, or experiences you use, your location, and applicable law.
Information you provide to us
You may provide us with your information as follows:
Contact data and account profile data.
We collect information when you (or your organization) create an account, activate a subscription, and/or upload information to the Intuit Platform. Personal information may include your name, previous name(s) and/or nicknames, title and honorifics, professional title and company name, education, billing and mailing addresses, phone number and email address, profile photo, billing information (your payment information), purchase history, demographic information, preferences, subscription data, and your username and account credentials.
Identity verification information.
We collect information to verify your identity, including your name, date of birth, social security number, social insurance number, driver’s license number, passport number, government-issued identification details, and similar information to verify your identity and to help you file your tax return.
Communications, feedback and survey data, and related data.
We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number and any other personal information you choose to share when you reach out to us for support, give us feedback, participate in optional surveys, attend our events, participate in product research or training, or otherwise interact or communicate with us. This information may include: call center recordings and call monitoring records, chat and text records, voicemails, photographs, and video images.
Marketing data.
You may provide us with your contact information and preferences for receiving marketing communications.
Social and community content.
We receive content you post on our social media pages and our community pages.
Business and financial information.

Device and contact data.

If you are a customer, vendor or prospect of an Intuit customer and interact with the Intuit Platform (for example, to pay an invoice, make a purchase, interact with an email, provide contact details or complete a survey), we will use this information to make recommendations about you to our customers. Our customers may also provide business connection data directly about you to us; this is described below under ‘Other users’.
Third-party sources
The Intuit Platform is designed to help you connect with other people and businesses. As a result of those connections, others may be able to input personal information about you, including other customers using the Intuit Platform. For example, an Intuit customer may share personal information about you with us in order to use and benefit from the Intuit Platform. You also may be able to input or process personal information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator of one of our products or use Intuit to manage customer lists. If you input information about others into the Platform, you must only do so if you have first provided sufficient notice and received any required permissions, and have an appropriate legal basis if required by applicable law.
We may also receive personal information about you from other third parties where you have provided consent or where permitted by applicable law. We protect and process the personal information obtained from those third parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. Our third-party sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the Intuit Platform. For example, we receive information from:
Linked third-party services.
If you choose to sync a non-Intuit account/service with your Intuit account, we will receive information from that account/service according to your settings with that account/service. This may include details of your bank account information, social media information, purchase history or your business’s sales records through a point of sale application.
Supplemental information and identity verification providers.
We work with certain third parties to help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business, and/or supplement the personal information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your personal information. For example, we use third-party providers to validate your contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address, phone number) or to provide additional details about your business. These providers may include, for example, your financial institution, telecommunications provider, or email provider.
Customer support providers.
We receive personal information about you or your interaction with the Intuit Platform from certain third parties for troubleshooting purposes. For example, we may obtain information about your interaction(s) with customer support and information about technical issues you have raised, including call center recordings, call monitoring records, voicemails, photographs and chat records.
Credit bureaus and related third parties.
Many Intuit features rely on information we receive from credit bureaus and related third parties. For example, in some countries, we may offer free credit reports and credit scores. We request these reports and credit scores on your behalf from credit bureau partners, like TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. These partners may also provide personal information such as employment or income data, social security number, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so we can make more personalized recommendations for you.
Other users.
As described above, we may receive personal information about you from other Intuit Platform users, such as your accountant, bookkeeper, tax preparer, spouse, employer, or other business customers using the Intuit Platform (e.g., businesses from which you buy products or services, or with which you otherwise interact). We may also collect such personal information through features like member referral programs.
Risk management, cybersecurity & anti-fraud providers.

We may collect information about your use of the Intuit Platform, such as the pages you viewed, the services and features you used or interacted with, your browser type, and details about any links or communications with which you interacted.
Location information.
Certain features in the Intuit Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion information, or both, if you or your organization grant(s) us permission to do so through your device settings (for example, if you use QuickBooks’ time-tracking service, participate in Karma Drive, or use CK Money to locate nearby ATMs).
Information stored locally.
Some of our web-enabled desktop services and offerings synchronize with the information on your computer. In doing so, we may collect information such as device information, product usage, and error reports. We may also store personal information locally on your device.

Cookies and similar technologies
Intuit and our service providers may use commonly used tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local shared objects and similar technologies (collectively “cookies”) to collect information about you (“
Cookie Information
”) so we can provide the experiences you request, recognize your visit, track your interactions, and improve your and other customers’ experiences. For example, we may use session-replay technologies,
such as those provided by FullStory and Medallia, that employ software code to record users’ interactions with the Services in a manner that allows us to watch video replays of those user sessions. The replays include users’ clicks, mobile app touches, mouse movements, scrolls and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement. You can learn more about FullStory at
https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy-policy

Your Rights
Depending on where you live, you may also have certain state- or country-specific rights with respect to your personal information. Please see the Region and state-specific terms section for your country, below.
Verification
To help protect privacy and the security of your personal information, you may be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity and/or ownership rights before we can fulfill your data rights request. If we cannot verify your identity or your ownership rights to the data, we may not be able to service your request until you provide proper documentation.
Data retention
Unless you specifically ask us to delete your personal information, we retain your personal information as long as it is necessary to comply with our data retention requirements and provide you with services and the benefits of the Intuit Platform and successfully run our business. Even if you submit a deletion request, we may be required to maintain your personal information for as long as necessary to:
comply with our legal or regulatory compliance needs (e.g., maintaining records of transactions you have made with us);
to exercise, establish or defend legal claims; and/or
to protect against fraudulent or abusive activity on our service.
This means we may keep different information for different periods. If your account is canceled because you haven’t used it for a long time, we may delete this information immediately.
There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize, or de-identify your personal information due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance, or other operational reasons. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to securely isolate your personal information from any further processing until such time as we are able to delete, anonymize, or de-identify it.
International data transfers
Unless you have provided us with consent to transfer your personal information, US Tax Preparation Information shall be processed and stored in the United States in accordance with applicable law.
With the exception noted above, Intuit reserves the right to store and process your personal information in the United States and in any other country where Intuit or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities in accordance with and as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
When we transfer, store or process personal information outside of your jurisdiction (including to or in the United States, as described above), we take appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law.
Some of these recipients of your personal information are located in countries for which the European Commission, the UK (and Gibraltar) Government, and the Swiss Government (as and where applicable) have issued adequacy decisions, which means that these countries are recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under applicable UK (and Gibraltar), European, and Swiss data protection laws and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Other recipients of your personal information are located in countries outside the EEA and/or the UK that are not the subject of an adequacy decision. In these cases, we may use the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or, as may be applicable, the International Data Transfer Agreement approved by the UK Government, to help ensure your personal information is protected. For more information on the transfer safeguards we rely on, please contact us by using the details in the “How to contact us” section below.
Intuit (excluding Credit Karma) and Mailchimp comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland to the United States. Intuit and Mailchimp rely on the EU-U.S. DPF to transfer data and will rely on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF once approved by the appropriate authorities.

Please note that we may claim legal exemptions for certain types of personal information and certain Intuit companies from all or certain parts of the CCPA, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and other data protection laws. In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as employees and job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.

Opt-out of Sales and/or Sharing.
Like many companies, Intuit and Mailchimp use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you as described above. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may classify our use of some of these services as “sharing” your Personal Information with the advertising partners that provide the services. You can opt-out of the “sharing” of your personal information by visiting the “Your California Privacy Rights” link in the footer of the Intuit website.
In addition, if you have enabled a recognized opt-out mechanism on your browser, device, or platform, you will automatically be opted out of any “sharings” when you interact with our Services. Please go here to learn more about enabling one such preference signal, the Global Privacy Control:
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download
. Intuit and Mailchimp do not sell personal information under the CCPA. Credit Karma does not sell or share personal information subject to the CCPA, and therefore does not offer a “Your California Privacy Rights” link on its website. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
Limit processing of sensitive personal information.
Some of the personal information that we may collect are considered sensitive personal information under the CCPA. We collect sensitive personal information for the purposes allowed by law or with your consent. We only use sensitive personal information as necessary for our (1) Service delivery and operations, (2) compliance and protection, (3) research and development, or (4) Service improvement and analytics purposes in accordance with CCPA.
