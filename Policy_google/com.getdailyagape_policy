, to fully understand.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, the Policy applies to any and all websites, mobile applications, and any other electronic and/or digital products and/or other services that are made available by Agapé and that link to this Policy, and our offline services (collectively, the “Services”).

.
When you access or otherwise use our Services, we may collect information from you. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our Services.

The information we collect may include information you directly provide to us, information we obtain automatically from your interactions with our Services, and information we obtain from other sources.

Information we collect automatically.
We and our third-party vendors, which include analytics companies such as Amplitude and Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services.

We may also track when and how frequently you access or use the Services, including how you engage with or navigate our site or mobile application. We may use this information (including the information collected by our third-party vendors) for analytics (including to determine which portions of the Services are used most frequently and what our users like/do not like), to evaluate the success of any advertising campaigns, for legitimate business interests and as otherwise described in this Policy.
We and our third-party vendors may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Services. These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Services to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services. We or our third-party vendors also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Services, because the Services may not function properly. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods. For more information, see https://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
When you use the Services, we may collect general location information (such as general location inferred from an IP address).
Information we collect from other sources.
We may also collect information about you from other parties. For example, when you are referred to the Services by another user.
In summary: Providing you with an excellent experience is at the heart of everything we do, including how we use the information we collect. We use your information thoughtfully and with great care, ensuring that our services not only meet but exceed your expectations. From crafting experiences and curating prompts that feel like they're made just for you, to keeping you in the loop about exciting new features and updates, every step we take is guided by our commitment to your privacy and satisfaction.
We may use your information for any of the following purposes:
(i) Provide and administer the Services;
(ii) Personalize the Services;
(iii) Communicate with you, including to inform you about features or aspects of the Services or third-party services we believe might be of interest to you, or to communicate with you about changes to our terms, conditions, or policies;

In summary: We enhance your Agapé experience by personalizing content, sometimes with the use of advanced technologies. Our dedication to privacy means we regularly evaluate our personalization practices to aim for responsible and sparing use of your information, always with the goal of making things better for you.
Our aim is to enrich your experience by delivering content that is not only relevant but also enhances your engagement with our Services. We achieve this by thoughtfully personalizing the content we present to you, drawing upon the information you've entrusted to our Services. This personalization process may leverage advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning (“ML”), allowing us to tailor our Services in a way that's most meaningful to you.
In our pursuit of creating a more relevant and enjoyable Agapé experience, we're committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy. We conscientiously limit our use of your personal information and we don’t want to use more of your personal information than necessary for refining our features and models.
In summary: We may share your information under certain conditions, such as with other users when they are the intended recipients or to aid in using our Services, with our affiliates who follow this Policy, and with service providers who assist us in various capacities. We also collaborate with academic partners for research, always prioritizing anonymity unless you consent otherwise. Additionally, we may disclose information to ensure the safety of Agapé and its users, comply with legal obligations, or during business transactions. Lastly, we may share your information with third parties if you explicitly consent or direct us to do so, ensuring that your privacy and trust in Agapé are always respected.
Other than what is mentioned in Section 2, we may disclose your information in any of the following circumstances:
Other Users and Intended Recipients.
We may disclose some of your information to other users of our Services, particularly when they are the intended recipient or when it facilitates your use of our Services. For instance, certain actions you take may be visible to other users, and this information may also become part of their data. For example, if you respond to a question shared with another user, you are directing us to make your responses to that question available to them. If that user requests a copy of their data, it will include any Content you sent to them, making such content part of their data as well, with all respective rights.
Additionally, in cases where a user is having trouble accessing their account, we may disclose the user's email address to a known connection within the Services, upon request, to assist with account recovery. This process involves providing your email address to a connection who may then share it with you to facilitate your account recovery. It is important to note that this disclosure is only made to connections that are mutually recognized within our platform to ensure a level of trust and security in the account recovery process.
Affiliates.
We may disclose information to our affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Agapé. Our affiliates may use the information we disclose in a manner consistent with this Policy.
Service Providers.
We may disclose your information to service providers who need access to such information to carry out work or perform services on our behalf, such as those who provide data storage, payment, technology support and services (including text generation models), survey tools, customer service, analytics, fraud prevention, legal services, and marketing services. We have thoughtfully selected each service provider. However, please be aware that each provider adheres to its own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, to which we, along with any information shared with them, are also subject.
Academic Partners.
We partner with academic institutions and/or researchers to further scientific understanding, particularly with how Agapé can help relationships. To do this, we generate anonymized information from your use of the App, or with your consent identifiable information, and we share this information with our academic partners so they may analyze it. This analysis can lead to published academic papers.
Safety and Protection of Agapé and Others.
We may disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to (i) protect or defend Agapé or other parties, including to defend or enforce this Policy, our Terms of Service, or any other contractual arrangement; and/or (ii) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Agapé, our agents and affiliates, our employees, users and/or the public.
Legal Requirements.
We may disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to comply with any law enforcement, legal, or regulatory process, such as to respond to a warrant, subpoena, court order, or other applicable laws and regulations.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose certain information, in connection with or during negotiations or closing of any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
Other Disclosures with Consent or at Your Direction
. We may disclose your information to nonaffiliated third parties based on your consent to do so. For example, you may direct us to disclose information about you when you refer us or our Services to your friends or other acquaintances.
Analytics.
We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as those of Amplitude and Google Analytics. These vendors use the sort of technology described in the “Information We Collect Automatically” section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by such technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these vendors, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services.
Tailored Advertising.
We may recommend third-party services we believe you may be interested in based on information you provide to us. For example, if you share that you are engaged we may recommend a third-party premarital counseling solution.
In summary: You have rights related to the handling of your information, including deleting or modifying your account information, opting out of certain permissions and marketing communications, and accessing or requesting changes to the information we hold about you. Depending on where you live, you might have additional rights, such as restricting how we use your information, transferring it, or withdrawing consent for certain uses. If you want to use these rights, you may need to verify your identity or use an authorized agent. Some information may be kept for legal reasons or to keep our services running, but we aim to respect your choices and privacy throughout this process.

Regional privacy disclosures and rights.
Additional disclosures for residents of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, California, and Nevada are set forth below in Regional Privacy Disclosures.
Residents of the European Economic Area and United Kingdom.
Agapé is considered the “data controller” of the “personal data” (as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation) we handle under this Policy. In other words, Agapé is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, and disclose personal data, subject to applicable law. The laws of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
Contractual Commitments: We may use, share, or disclose personal data to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, we will process your personal data to comply with our agreements with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.
With Your Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose personal data on the basis of your consent.
Legitimate Interests: In many cases, we use, share, or disclose personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, personalization of the Services, providing security for the Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.
Legal Compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
In addition to those rights described herein, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.
Residents of Nevada.
If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain personal information to unaffiliated parties. You can exercise this right by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below with the subject line “Nevada Do Not Sell Request” and providing us with your name and the email address. We do not currently sell your personal information as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A.
Residents of California.
Throughout this Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we disclose it. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), we also have to provide you with the “categories” of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect and disclose for business or commercial purposes (as “categories” are defined by the CCPA).
In the twelve months leading up to the effective date of this Policy, we have collected and disclosed the categories of personal information described in Section 1 for business or commercial purposes. The categories of personal information are: identifiers, financial information (such as payment information), commercial or transactional information, internet or other electronic network activity information, general geolocation data, audio or video information (such as pictures and videos you submit), other information about you that you may provide to us voluntarily, such as through User Content, other information that may identify you, and inferences drawn from the information we collect.
We also collect the following categories of “sensitive personal information,” as defined under the CCPA: (i) account log-in and password or other credentials that allow access to your account; and (ii) other sensitive personal information you may voluntarily provide to us in your capacity as an individual user of the Services (including, but not limited to, information you share as part of completing a survey like our wellness checks or if you voluntarily share User Content revealing your race, religion, or sexual orientation).
We process the categories of personal information identified above for the purposes as described in more detail in Section 2 above.
We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the Services; and (3) other parties such as other users and through unaffiliated parties.
We describe our information disclosure practices in more detail in section 3, above.
“Sharing” of personal information
The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses regarding the processing of personal information. Where we refer to “sell” or “share” (or their variants) in quotes, we are referencing those terms as uniquely defined in the CCPA.
We may use third-party analytics services and online advertising services that may result in the “sharing” of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, general location information, and usage information) with advertising partners to advertise the Services on other websites.
We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of children under 16.
Do-Not-Track disclosure
We do not respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations, and solutions.
Retention of your personal information
Please see the Data Retention section below.
CCPA rights
California residents can make requests about their personal information as described as set forth in Rights to Information About You above. The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.
The Services are not designed for minors under 13, and our Terms of Service prohibit use by anyone under 13 or under 16 if you are a resident of the European Economic Area. If we discover that an individual under 13 has provided us with “personal information,” as defined in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we will close the account and delete the personal information to the extent required by COPPA. We may, where permitted by law, retain certain information internally for purposes described in this Policy.
Agapé implements technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you provide over the internet to us.
In General.
We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Our services are global and your information may be stored and processed in the United States and other countries outside the United States that may have data protection laws that differ from the laws in your country, and data may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. By using the Services, or providing us with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance, and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable countries in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as, or equivalent to, those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
The Services may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information by third parties will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or services, and not this Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third parties before providing information to them.
We may change this Policy to reflect changes in the law, our information practices or the features of the Services. We will indicate the date of the most recent update in this Policy. If we make a material change to the Policy, you will be provided with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to use the Services, you are confirming that you have read, understood, and accepted the latest version of this Policy. If you are not actively using the Services but still have information stored within them, by not deleting your account within 14 days of any changes, you are agreeing to the latest version of this Policy.
