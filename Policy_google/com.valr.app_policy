Public information on our site
Public profile.
When you create your profile on our Service, other users or visitors may access your public profile and see any information you have made available about yourself. When browsing for trading ideas, they will only be able to view your market information (i.e. published ideas and scripts, markets allocation, top mentioned Symbols, etc.), social information (i.e. followers and following lists along with the ideas that you follow and comment on), contact information (i.e. your About section, avatar, links to your social media accounts, website, etc.), your community status (i.e. Moderator or Pro badges, statistical information such as reputation points, views, likes, followers, registration date, as well your last visit date). Your email address, however, will not be visible (unless you choose to make it visible).
Public content.
Our Service allows those with a registered user account to share their charts with indicators and comments, their ideas, scripts, and other content with the rest of the internet via our publish features.
By using public publishing features, you grant us an irrevocable, perpetual, and royalty-free license to publish and disclose the content, as well as the username of the author, which makes you identifiable.
You can also publish your content as "private". This means that it will not be displayed in your profile or your lists of ideas, scripts, etc., nor will it be indexed by search engines. However, users who have a direct link to your content will be able to view it. Note that you will control over who/which users have access to a link.
When you comment on any content, we also publish certain information about your comment: including date, time and application (such as "TradingView for iOS" if you commented on it from one of our applications).
Chats and private messages.
When you communicate with other users in public and private chats, we store and process your messages and any related information. We check links to make sure there is no malicious software or content as well as to detect spam and prohibited images/text. When you use private messages to communicate, please keep in mind that the recipients have a copy of your correspondence as well. This will continue to be the case even if you delete such correspondence from your account. Recipients can copy, store and/or reshare these messages. Be constantly vigilant of this.
Security of personal data
We use technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal data and require third parties with whom we work to do the same.
We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology in order to protect certain information that you submit to us. This technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone while it is being transmitted to TradingView or payment processor. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the "lock" icon in the browser window is displayed, confirming that a secure and encrypted connection has been established with the Website. We work hard to ensure that our Service is secure and that we meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards, such as firewalls, authentication systems (i.e. passwords, and personal identification numbers), and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data. If you have chosen to create an account, you are responsible for doing everything you reasonably can to keep your access details secret. You must not share these details with anyone else.
We also do our best to protect user information offline. All of our users' personal information is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need to see the information to perform their jobs are allowed to access it.
The servers that store personal data are located in a secure environment in a locked facility.
We are constantly improving the ways we secure, store, and process the data we collect, including the addition of physical security measures that help us counter unauthorized access to our systems. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Children and sensitive personal data
This Website is not directed towards children who are under the age of 18. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children below the age of 18 years, or sensitive personal data ("racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation," etc.). Please consult
Art. 9 GDPR
for more information. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately so that we can either obtain special consent or delete the information.
Third-party sites
Links to other sites.
At our discretion we may add links (web links) to other websites from our Website. These websites can be run by third parties with separate and independent privacy policies. We, therefore, have no responsibility nor are we liable for any content, activities or privacy policies of these linked sites. We suggest you read the privacy policy of each and every site that you visit.
Our hosted charting solutions.
Some business partners use our charting solutions on their own websites. Such sites may display messages such as "Powered by TradingView" or similar. We do not control the privacy policies of these sites, regardless of whether or not these messages are displayed. Again, we suggest you read the privacy policy of each and every site that you visit.
EEA and UK users' specific rights
Individuals subject to European and United Kingdom ("UK") data protection laws may have data subject rights in relation to the personal data we hold on them (described in detail below). This may, in and of itself, be subject to limitations and/or restrictions.
If you are located in the EEA or UK, please contact us to exercise your rights.
Accessing data.
If prompted, we will confirm whether or not we are processing your personal data and if so, we will provide you with a copy of that personal data along with any other pertinent details. If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee, but this can be discussed and depends on the situation.
Restricting the processing of personal data.
You may ask us to restrict or 'block' the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the data or object to us processing it. We will notify you before we lift any restriction on processing. If we share your personal data with others, we will notify them of the restriction wherever possible. If prompted, and if it is possible and lawful to do so, we will also notify you with whom we have shared or will share your personal data so you can contact them directly.
Objections.
You may:
ask us to stop processing your personal data at any time, and we will do so. If we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your personal data, then it should not be a problem unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing;
object to our processing of your data for the purposes of direct marketing at any time. This can be done by clicking the "unsubscribe" button in our marketing emails; and
refuse to receive service notifications via email (for example, when a user you are subscribed to publishes a chart, idea, etc.). This can be adjusted in the
User Settings
.
Withdrawal of consent.
If we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness with which we process your data before receiving notice of your wish to withdraw your consent. We emphasize that we do not generally rely on your consent to allow us to process your personal data if there is another lawful ground available. If we do rely on your consent, we will make this clear to you at that time.
Viewing and correcting data.
You have the right to have inaccurate personal data rectified or completed if it is incomplete. In order to do so, each user can view, manage and/or update his/her personal data in the
Profile Settings
.
If we share your personal data with others, we will notify them of any corrections made whenever possible. If prompted, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also notify you with whom we have shared your personal data so you can contact them directly if need be.
Deleting data.
You have the right to refuse to use our Services and may ask us to delete or remove your personal data in certain circumstances. If we share your data with others, we will notify them of the edits wherever possible.
