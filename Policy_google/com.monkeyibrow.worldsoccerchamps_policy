Privacy Policy
Effective Date:
January 14, 2025
1. Introduction and Scope
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to the mobile application
World Soccer Champs
(the "App"), developed and published by
Pedro Soares
("we," "our," or "us"), as well as any related services, 
  websites, or other applications that link to this Policy (collectively, the "Services").
We are committed to respecting and safeguarding your privacy rights. 
  By installing, using, or otherwise accessing the App or Services, you agree to this 
  Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not install, use, or otherwise access 
  our App or Services.
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post any modifications on this 
  page and indicate the date on which the changes were made. By continuing to use our 
  App or Services after any changes become effective, you agree to the updated Policy.
2. Information We Collect and How We Use It
Our primary purpose in collecting information is to provide and improve the Services 
  and to enable you to navigate and use our App easily. We may collect the following types 
  of information:
Device Information:
We may collect and record certain information 
    automatically such as your device model, operating system version, MAC address, 
    IP address, advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA, AAID), and/or mobile network 
    information for troubleshooting, analytics, and to ensure the best possible user 
    experience.
Usage Data:
We collect information about your usage of the App, 
    such as pages viewed, taps, clicks, and in-App actions. We use this data to improve 
    in-App content, features, and user experience, as well as for analytics and 
    statistical purposes.
Location Data:
We may collect approximate location data based 
    on your IP address or, if you expressly grant permission, through GPS coordinates. 
    You can opt out of GPS location sharing in your device's settings.
Cookies and Similar Technologies:
Our website and some App 
    features may use cookies or similar tracking technologies to remember your 
    preferences and gather analytics data. You can disable cookies via your browser 
    settings, but this may affect certain features.
3. How We Share Your Information
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may 
  share information in the following ways:
Service Providers:
We may share information with third-party 
    vendors or partners who help us perform services such as hosting, analytics, 
    customer support, and advertising. These partners only process your data on 
    our behalf and according to our instructions.
Advertising:
The App may display ads served by third-party 
    networks (e.g., AdColony, Flurry, Vungle). These networks may use cookies or 
    other tracking technologies to personalize advertisements. You can learn more 
    about how to opt out of targeted ads by visiting their respective privacy policies 
    or opt-out links.
Legal Compliance:
We may disclose your information if required 
    by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or lawful request by public authorities.
Business Transfers:
In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale 
    of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
4. Data Retention and Deletion
We retain your information for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes 
  outlined in this Policy or as otherwise required or permitted by law. When we no 
  longer need your information, we will either delete or anonymize it.
You may request the deletion of your personal data at any time by contacting us 
  using the information in the "Contact Us" section below, and we will respond within 
  a reasonable timeframe, subject to any legal obligations that require us to retain 
  certain data.
5. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information 
  from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, or disclosure. However, no 
  security measure is entirely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
6. Children's Privacy
Our App is not directed to children under the age required by applicable law, and 
  we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that 
  we have unintentionally collected personal information about a child, please contact 
  us so we can delete such data promptly.
7. International Data Transfer
We operate internationally and may transfer your information outside of your home 
  country to jurisdictions where data protection laws may differ. By using the App, 
  you consent to the transfer of your information as described in this Policy.
8. Do Not Track
We currently do not respond to "Do Not Track" signals. Third-party services that 
  we use may collect information about your online activities over time and across 
  different websites or online services.
9. Your Rights
Depending on where you reside, you may have rights under local data protection 
  laws, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. 
  Please contact us at the email below if you wish to exercise any of these rights.
