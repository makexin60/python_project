If you call one of these uniquely generated toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may collect non-personally identifiable information about the call (e.g. date, time, duration), as well as personally identifiable information (e.g. your name, the number from which your call originated).

These widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, are visible to you on the web page you visit. Integration between the Autotrader Sites and social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and others may allow social media networks in which you participate to collect information about you, even when you do not explicitly activate the network’s application or widget.

The privacy policy of the social media network controls the collection, use and disclosure of all personal information transmitted to that network.
Advertising Networks
Advertising that is customized based on predictions generated over time from your visits across different websites, devices and mobile applications is sometimes called “online behavioral” or “interest-based” advertising. We may partner with advertising networks, which are companies that deliver targeted advertisements to consumers and generate statistics and metrics related to the delivery of interest-based advertisements. They may utilize information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our affiliates and other advertisers. This data collection takes place both on the Autotrader Sites and on third-party websites and mobile applications. This process allows Autotrader and third parties to deliver targeted advertising, enhance marketing programs and help track the effectiveness of such efforts. Our advertising networks also may use this information for determining or predicting the characteristics and preferences of their respective advertising audiences and measuring the effectiveness of their advertising in accordance with their privacy policies.
We do not provide information that is directly associated with a specific person (such as name and address) to an advertising network when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may make an assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisement.
You may also modify your cookie and tracking technology preferences by using the “Manage Cookies” link below. If you choose to decline cookies or similar technologies, however, please note that certain features may not function properly or at all as a result.

Privacy Policy

If you are a resident of California, you have the right to submit certain requests relating to your PI as described below.
Right to Opt-Out of Share and Sale of Your Personal Information
Exercising Opt-Out Rights
You have the right to direct us to not Sell or Share your PI, as defined under the CCPA. Our use of cookies for advertising and marketing are considered a “Sale” or “Sharing” under the CCPA. We provide Californians who use our Services a way to manage their cookie preferences based on categories of cookies through our management tool available

More information on how to exercise choices regarding Third Party cookies and interest-based advertising is available

You may also opt out of the Sale or Sharing of your PI via cookies or tracking technologies through an opt-out preference signal. In order to process your request through an opt-out preference signal, you must use a browser supporting the preference signal. If you choose to use an opt-out preference signal, you will need to turn it on for each browser and each device you use.
California Minors
We do not knowingly Share or Sell the PI of Consumers we know are under 16. Any California residents under the age of 18 who have registered to use our Services, and who posted content or information on our websites, can request removal by contacting us at
privacy@coxinc.com
detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it. We will then make reasonably good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it, so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, other parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that we do not control.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Your Sensitive Personal Information
We do not use or disclose Sensitive PI for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for any other reasons besides the permitted purposes including: to provide our goods and services, or as needed: to ensure security and integrity; to prevent fraud or illegal activity; for physical safety; for short-term, transient use, including for non-personalized advertising; to perform services on behalf of the business; and to verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance such services or devices.  For this reason, we do not treat the Sensitive PI we process as subject to a limit use and disclosure request and, therefore, we do not offer a way for you to submit such a request.
Right to Know, Delete, and Correct Your Personal Information
California Consumers have the right to exercise certain privacy rights under the CCPA. Any Request to Know, Request to Delete, and Request to Correct you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (“
Verifiable Consumer Request
”). We will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we Collected PI.
If you are unable to provide us with certain information about yourself or, in some cases, about your transaction history with us, we will be unable to verify your identity to fulfill a request to know , delete, or correct. In some cases, we may verify identity by confirming that you are the owner of the email address we have on file. For your specific pieces of information, as required by the CCPA, we will apply heightened verification standards, and reserve the right to request further information from you, in addition to the information mentioned above.
Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with a Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests. Under the CCPA they are exceptions to your request rights. If we do not comply fully with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we Collect, Process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
You may use an Authorized Agent to submit a Consumer rights request. If you use an Authorized Agent to submit a request, we may require proof that the agent has been authorized by you to do so, and take other steps permissible under the CCPA, to ensure it is a proper request by an authorized agent.
The Right to Know
You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following:
The categories of PI we have Collected about you, including:
The categories of sources from which the PI was Collected
Our Business or Commercial Purposes for Collecting, Selling, or Sharing PI
The categories of Third Parties to which we disclose PI
The  categories of PI that we Sold or Shared, and for each category identified, the categories of Third Parties to which we Sold or Shared that particular category of PI
The categories of PI  that we disclosed for a Business Purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of Third Parties to which we disclosed that particular category of PI
The specific pieces of PI we have Collected about you.
The Right to Deletion
You may request that we delete your PI that we have Collected directly from you and are maintaining. Exceptions do apply, including, without limitation, where we need to retain your PI as permitted by applicable law, such as for regulatory reasons, to complete a warranty or other contract with you, or other internal uses of the information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not Collect directly from you.
The Right to Correct
If you believe that any of your PI we maintain about you is inaccurate, you have the right to request that we correct that information. Note that we may deny your request if we determine that the contested PI is more likely than not accurate based on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the PI, how we obtained the contested PI, and documentation relating to the accuracy of the PI. We may also delete the contested PI as an alternative to correcting the information only if the deletion of PI does not negatively impact you, or you give us consent to delete the contested PI.
To exercise the right to know, right to delete, or right to correct, you may submit a request by clicking
here
or calling us at
1-800-933-9771
and including your name, address, email address, and phone number. Do not send other information via e-mail. We will contact you for further information if necessary. In order to complete your request, you will be required to respond to any follow up inquires we may make, and we may deny your request if you do not do so.
Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights
CEI will not discriminate against any Consumer for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
Separate from your CCPA rights, California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. We do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may request information about our compliance with Shine the Light by contacting us at
privacy@coxinc.com
or by sending a letter to:
Cox Enterprises Inc.
ATTN: Chief Privacy Officer: Shine the Light Request
6205-A Peachtree Dunwoody Road
Atlanta, GA 30328
Any such request must include “California Shine the Light Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address or mail address.
As these rights and your CCPA rights are not the same and exist under different laws, you must exercise your rights under each law separately.
If you have any questions about this CA Notice, please contact CEI at
privacy@coxinc.com
. Requests under Section 4 California Privacy Rights will not be accepted via email.
