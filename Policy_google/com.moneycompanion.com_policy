Privacy Policy
At Money Companion, your privacy is our priority. We are committed to ensuring your personal information remains private and secure.
This privacy policy outlines how our app operates and reassures you that
we do not collect, store, or share any personal data
from our users.
1. No Data Collection
Money Companion is designed to provide you with a seamless financial tracking experience without requiring access to your personal data.
No account setup required:
You can use Money Companion without creating an account or providing any personal details.
Offline functionality:
All your data stays on your device, ensuring privacy and security.
No cloud storage:
Your financial information and records are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers or third-party services.
2. Permissions
To enhance your experience, Money Companion may request access to certain device features. For example:
Storage Access:
To allow exporting data as reports (e.g., PDFs, Excel).
Camera Access:
If you choose to attach images (e.g., receipts) to your financial entries.
These permissions are used solely for the described purposes and not for data collection.
3. Security
While we do not collect or store any of your data, we encourage you to use the security features
provided in the app, such as PIN protection or biometric authentication, to safeguard your financial information
stored locally on your device.
4. Third-Party Services
Money Companion integrates with third-party services (e.g., AdMob for displaying ads) to support
the app’s development and ensure it remains free for users. These services may collect limited,
non-personal information for ad targeting, such as device information or general location data (not precise)
5. Your Rights
Since Money Companion does not collect your data, there are no records to request, modify, or delete.
All information you input remains solely under your control on your device.
6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in app functionality or legal requirements.
Any changes will be communicated through the app or an updated version of this policy.
