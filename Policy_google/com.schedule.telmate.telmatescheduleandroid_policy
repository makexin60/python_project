Description of Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”)
CPNI is proprietary information about you that includes (1) information on the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of your use of ViaPath telecommunications services, that you make available to ViaPath solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship; and (2) information contained in the bills you receive concerning your telecommunications service. It does not include (1) your name, address, or phone number; (2) aggregated customer information that does not identify specific individuals; or (3) information about non-telecommunications service, such as Internet access. Under the CPNI rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), you have the right, and ViaPath has the duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI.
ViaPath's Use of CPNI
Under FCC rules, ViaPath may use your CPNI without your prior approval for certain purposes. Specifically, ViaPath may use, disclose, or permit access to your CPNI without your consent, either directly or through its agents, for the purpose of (1) initiating, rendering, billing, and collecting for ViaPath Service; (2) protecting ViaPath's right or property, or protecting ViaPath users and other telecommunications carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, ViaPath services; (3) maintenance and repair; and (4) complying with the orders or subpoenas of a court of competent jurisdiction. Other uses require your approval, as described below.
Required Customer Approval
As a leader in the corrections industry, ViaPath is continually developing new innovations in the fields of technology, education, and intelligence. From time to time, ViaPath may use and share your individually identifiable CPNI among its affiliates and agents to inform you about communications-related products and services or special promotions. Use of your individually identifiable CPNI enhances ViaPath's ability to offer products and services that are tailored to your needs.
You have 30 days from the date of this notice to inform us (see “Contacting ViaPath” above) if you do not wish ViaPath to use your individually identiﬁable CPNI for this purpose. If you do not so inform us, ViaPath will assume you consent to this use of your individually identiﬁable CPNI.
At any time after this 30-day period has elapsed, however, you have the right to disapprove this use, and limit or revoke access to your individually identiﬁable CPNI by contacting ViaPath. A denial of approval will not affect ViaPath's provision of services to you. Your approval or denial of ViaPath's use of your individually identiﬁable CPNI is valid until you affirmatively revoke or limit that approval or denial.
ViaPath will never disclose your individually identifiable CPNI to unaffiliated third parties without your express, opt-in consent.
