We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

Automatic Data Collection and Advertising
We do not use tools or third party analytical software to collect and use certain non-personal data that does not enable us to identify you. We do not pass any personally identifiable information to ad networks or advertisers.
We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.
Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Application. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy at https://sites.google.com/view/wear-casts/home/privacy.
