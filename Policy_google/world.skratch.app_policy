Privacy Policy
Effective: May 01, 2019
‍
Skratch takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. We’ve written this policy to help you best understand what information we collect, how we use it and the choices you have as a Skratch user.
When you use any of the Skratch platform (collectively, the “Services”), you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, as well as the terms set forth in our
Terms of Use
. Please read it very carefully, and feel free to
contact us
with any questions and comments.
By using or accessing the Services provided by Skratch, you are accepting the practices and policies described in this Privacy Policy and consent that we can collect and use all or part of the information outlined below. You also consent to your information being shared as outlined in our Terms of Use.
‍
What information do we collect?
‍
‍
1. Account Information
When you sign up to use Skratch, you voluntarily give us certain information to setup your account including Name, Username and Email address or Mobile phone number which are required fields. Further information can be added at the individual user’s discretion.
When you access and use the Services, you also hereby grant us the right to automatically collect the data stored in the camera roll on the Device from which you are accessing and using the Services (the “Camera Roll Data”). We will only store the Camera Roll Data in hashed form (i.e. in a manner in which we cannot read the data).
‍
‍
2. Non-Personal Information
Whenever you use our Services, we collect aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about you and your use of the Services, including:
‍
Log Data
- When you access the Services by or through a mobile device, we may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device unique ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use and other statistics ("Log Data" or “Meta Data”).
In addition, we may use third party services such as Firebase and Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to improve our Services. These third-party Services providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information
‍
‍
Cookie Data
– “Cookies” are pieces of data on your mobile device or computer tied to information about you which recognize you as a return user and help us to provide a more relevant experience for you. When we use cookies, we may use either “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). If you decline to accept cookies you may not be able to use all the Services provided by this app.
Device Information
– In some cases, we may collect information about the device you’re using Skratch on, including type of device, crash data, device settings and operating system. The information we can obtain depends on the individual device, so please be sure to check the privacy policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
Location Information
– We may use and store information about your location depending on the permissions you have set on your device. We use this information to provide features of our Services, to improve and customize our Services. You can enable or disable location services at anytime, through your mobile device settings.
‍
How do we use the information we collect?
‍
The security of your personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
All of the information we collect goes towards making Skratch a more relevant and engaging experience for our users. We may also use the information collected to:
Continue to improve the Skratch platform and all affiliated services.
Send you updates via email (i.e. new feature announcements, activity on your account). You can opt out of these by unsubscribing to emails.
Send you updates via push notification or text (i.e. new feature announcements, activity on your account). You can opt out of these by updating your settings in the app.
Help your friends and contacts find you easily on Skratch.
Recommend new content for you based on your activity.
Analyse trends, track user movement and gather statistical information for aggregate use.
Respond to any questions or comments.

‍
How do we share the information we collect?
‍
By default, Skratch is a private network, so the limited instances where we may share your personal information include:
With Your Consent
– For example, if you’ve chosen to link your Skratch account to Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, we will share information with these external Services.
‍
Compliance with Law
– We will disclose certain information if it is required to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the rights, safety or property of the public or Skratch against fraud, security or technical issues.
‍
Third Parties
– We may contract with third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based strictly on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
‍
Business Transfers
– In the event that Skratch undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, dissolution or reorganisation, we may transfer the information described in this policy to the new organisation. We will provide notice before any personal information is transferred.
‍
What choices do you have about your information?
‍
As a travel platform, we aim to offer you transparency on the options you have over your information. We have integrated simple, visual and flexible privacy options directly into Skratch to help you manage access to different types of personal information. For example, you can:
Share your Skratch map with defined networks of people and remove access at any time
Opt in or out of sharing your location with the app
Link or unlink your Skratch account from a 3rd party platform (such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter), tailor the permissions of each 3rd party platform.
Deactivate your account at any time. Once we have received your “proof of authority” over the account, we will close the account and remove all associated content. However, we may retain copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
‍
Links to third party websites
‍
We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Services, including the information or content contained within them. Please remember that when you navigate away from our Services to another third-party website or Services, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. We do not accept responsibility for their content, privacy practices and procedures whatsoever as we have no control over them.
‍
Security of your information
‍
Your account information is verified by your mobile number. To prevent unauthorized access to your account, we recommend you limit access to your mobile phone (this includes password protecting your phone, locking your SIM and restricting the number of people who can use your mobile phone).
We implement commercially suitable administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline. Whilst we take precautions against possible security breaches, we cannot guarantee unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur.
‍
Our Policy on Children's Information
‍
Skratch is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 13. No one under the age of 13 is authorized to submit any information, including personally identifying information, to Skratch. We are not liable for any damages that may result from a user’s misrepresentation of age. Parents or legal guardians of children under 13 cannot agree to these terms on their behalf.
If you learn that a minor has provided us with personal information without consent, please
contact us
and we will reasonably try to erase such information from our records as quickly as possible though we can give no assurance that we are able to do so.

‍
We reserve the right to amend or change our Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process of modifications set forth in our
