We strive to minimize the collection of sensitive information. However, the optional collection of precise location data, as described above, may fall under this category depending on applicable laws.
Aggregate and Anonymous Data:
We may collect data in an aggregated or anonymized format that does not directly identify you. This information is used for analytics, trend analysis, and app improvement purposes.
HOW WE COLLECT DATA.
We collect data from you through various interactions with our Platform, including when you actively provide information and when it is gathered automatically as you use the app.
When you create an account or update your profile, you voluntarily provide information such as your name, email address, profile picture, cover picture, and couple anniversary date. This data is necessary to personalize your experience and ensure the functionality of the app.
In addition to the information you provide, we automatically collect certain details about your device and interactions with our Platform. For example, we gather data about your device type, operating system, app version, IP address, time zone, and language settings. We also track how you use the app, including the features you interact with and the duration of your sessions. This information is used to improve the app, develop new features, and maintain the security and stability of our systems.
If you grant permission, we may collect your precise location to enable optional, location-based features within the app. Location data is only collected with your explicit consent and is not mandatory for using our Platform. We store only the most recent location data while your account is active, and we do not retain a history of your location. This data may also be gathered in the background if you enable specific features or widgets that rely on location tracking.
The information we collect, whether provided directly by you or gathered automatically, ensures that we can deliver a secure, personalized, and high-quality experience tailored to your needs.

NO SALE OF DATA.
We uphold the highest standards of data privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information of our users. In line with this commitment, we firmly assert that we do not engage in the sale of any user's personal data. This stance is a core element of our privacy practices and reflects our dedication to maintaining the trust and confidence of our users.
For clarity, the term "sale" of data, as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to the exchanging, transferring, or otherwise making available of a user's personal data to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. We understand the importance of this distinction and assure our users that their personal data will not be treated as a commodity in any business transactions.
It is important to note that this Privacy Policy does not preclude us from sharing data in ways that do not constitute a "sale" as defined above. This includes sharing information with service providers who assist us in operating our Platform, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as these parties agree to keep this information confidential and use it solely for the purposes we have directed. Moreover, we may disclose personal data when legally required to do so, to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
We prioritize transparency in all our data practices and aim to provide our users with control over their personal data. In line with this, we ensure that users are informed about the types of data we collect, the purposes for which we collect it, and the circumstances under which it might be shared, as detailed in other sections of this Privacy Policy.
This No Sale of Data policy is subject to regular review and may be updated to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. Any updates will be communicated through revisions to our Privacy Policy, and we encourage users to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect their personal information.
LAWFUL BASIS FOR COLLECTION.
At Couple Joy, we collect and process your personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. The lawful basis for our data collection and processing activities depends on the nature of the information and the specific context in which it is collected. We rely on the following lawful bases:
Consent:
Your consent is the foundation for many of our data collection practices. For instance, when you voluntarily provide your information during account registration or enable location tracking, you explicitly agree to the collection and use of this data for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. You can withdraw your consent at any time by adjusting your settings or contacting us, although this may limit your access to certain features of the Platform.
Contractual Necessity:
The processing of your personal data is essential for the performance of the contract between you and Couple Joy. For example, we require your data to create your account, provide access to the app, and enable its core features. Without this information, we would be unable to fulfill our contractual obligations to you.
Legitimate Interests:
We process certain data to pursue our legitimate business interests in providing a secure, high-quality, and personalized user experience. These interests include app optimization, fraud prevention, and system security. When processing your data based on legitimate interests, we ensure that your privacy rights are not overridden by our operational needs.
Legal Obligations:
In some cases, we are required to collect, retain, or disclose personal data to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes. For example, we may process your data to respond to a court order or government request.
User Protection:
We may process your data when necessary to protect your vital interests or the interests of others, such as ensuring the safety and security of the Platform or addressing unauthorized access.
By relying on these lawful bases, we ensure that our data collection and processing activities are conducted responsibly, transparently, and in compliance with all applicable legal requirements. If you have questions about the lawful basis for a specific data processing activity, please contact us using the details provided in the

DATA SECURITY.
At Couple Joy, safeguarding your personal information is one of our highest priorities. We have implemented robust technical, administrative, and organizational measures designed to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. While no system can guarantee complete security, we are committed to employing industry best practices to minimize risks and ensure your data remains secure.
Security Measures We Implement:
Encryption:
Data transmitted through our Platform is protected using encryption protocols to prevent unauthorized access during transmission.

Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel who require it to perform their job functions. These individuals are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and are trained in data protection practices.

Backup Systems:
Hourly backups of your data are performed and retained for up to 90 days to ensure data availability and recovery in the event of system failures or unforeseen incidents.
While we take significant steps to protect your personal information, it is important to note that no system is entirely immune to security breaches. You play a critical role in maintaining the security of your data by:
Using a strong, unique password for your account.
Avoiding sharing your login credentials with others.
= Keeping your device secure and updating your operating system and apps regularly to benefit from the latest security patches.
In the unlikely event of a data breach, we have a comprehensive incident response plan in place to address and mitigate potential harm as outlined in the Section titled “Data Breach Response.” If your personal information is affected, we will notify you promptly, as required by applicable laws, and provide you with steps you can take to protect yourself further.

DATA RETENTION.
We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The retention period for your data depends on the type of information, the reason it was collected, and applicable laws and regulations.
Account Information:
Your account data, including your name, email, profile picture, cover picture, and couple anniversary date, is retained for as long as your account remains active. Once you delete your account, all personal data is immediately removed from our primary database.

Location Data:
If you have opted to share your location, we store only your last known location while your account is active. No historical location data is retained.
Usage Data:
Aggregated and anonymized usage data may be retained indefinitely for analytical and operational purposes, as it does not identify you personally.
In certain situations, we may be required to retain your data beyond the standard retention period to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, such as tax or audit requirements, or to address disputes or enforce agreements.
You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data at any time by deleting your account through the app (Profile > Settings > Delete Account). Once your account is deleted, we will remove your data from the primary database and cease processing it, except as necessary to fulfill legal or regulatory obligations.
We regularly review our data retention policies to ensure they align with evolving legal requirements and industry best practices. Any updates to our retention policies will be reflected in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about how long we retain specific types of data or need assistance deleting your information, please contact us using the details provided in the Contact Us section.

THIRD PARTY SERVICES.
Couple Joy relies on select third-party service providers to deliver, maintain, and improve our Platform. These providers assist us in areas such as data storage, communication, analytics, and security.

These third parties are bound by contractual obligations to protect your data and use it only as instructed by us. They are prohibited from accessing or using your information for any other purpose.
While these services have access to certain data necessary to perform their functions, we take care to minimize the information shared and ensure it is protected.

DATA TRANSFERS.
Couple Joy is a global platform, and your personal data may be transferred to, stored, or processed in locations outside of your country of residence. These transfers are necessary to deliver our services, ensure platform functionality, and comply with applicable legal obligations. This section outlines how we handle international data transfers and protect your information.
Your data is primarily stored on secure servers located in Germany. However, to maintain operational flexibility, we may transfer and store your data in other locations, including outside the European Union. These transfers could involve processing by our service providers, such as hosting providers or technical support teams, located in jurisdictions with varying levels of data protection laws. We implement stringent measures to protect your personal data during international transfers, ensuring it receives an equivalent level of protection as required by applicable laws. These measures may include:
Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs): We use SCCs approved by regulatory authorities to ensure that data transferred outside the EU meets high standards of privacy and security.
Data Processing Agreements: All third-party service providers handling your data are contractually obligated to adhere to our data protection standards and applicable legal requirements.
Encryption and Security Measures: Your data is encrypted during transmission to safeguard it from unauthorized access.
By using our Platform and providing your personal data, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information in countries outside of your own, including those that may not provide the same level of data protection. We ensure that all transfers are conducted lawfully and with the necessary safeguards in place.
We comply with all applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to ensure your data is handled responsibly during international transfers. If specific local laws require additional steps to protect your data, we will take those measures. If you have any questions or concerns about how your personal data is transferred, or if you would like to learn more about the safeguards in place, please contact us using the details provided in the Contact Us section.
DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS.
Our Platform currently does not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals from web browsers. DNT is a privacy preference that you can set in your web browser to indicate your preference regarding the tracking of your online activities.
While many web browsers support the DNT feature, there is no standard interpretation or industry consensus regarding the meaning of DNT signals. As a result, our Platform does not currently recognize or respond to DNT signals.
Please note that even if you have enabled the DNT feature in your web browser, certain third-party services integrated into our Platform may still collect and track your online activities in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services for more information on their tracking practices.
MODIFICATION.
We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes we make will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Platform. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we collect, use, and protect your information.
By continuing to use our Platform after any changes to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree to the updated terms. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and ensure that you are aware of any modifications. If you disagree with any changes, you should discontinue your use of our Platform and contact us if you would like to request the deletion of your personal information.
Please note that any provision of this Privacy Policy that imposes an obligation on you or grants us a right will survive the termination or expiration of this Privacy Policy or your use of our Platform.
