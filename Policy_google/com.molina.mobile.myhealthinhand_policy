Molina Healthcare's Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions of Use
PLEASE READ THE PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY
By using Molina Healthcare’s website(s) and/or
mobile application(s) (collectively, the “Sites”), you agree to the Privacy
Policy, as well as the Terms & Conditions of Use contained therein
(collectively referred to as the "Terms of Use"). By accessing and
using the Sites, you accept, without limitation or qualification, these Terms
of Use. Molina Healthcare may modify these Terms of Use by revising them on the
Sites. Your continued use of the Sites constitutes your acceptance of any such
revisions. You should therefore periodically visit this page to review the
current Terms of Use. You may not modify these Terms of Use except in a written
agreement signed by Molina Healthcare. The Terms of Use do not address personal
information that you provide to us in other contexts (e.g., through a business
relationship not handled through the Sites, such as membership in a Molina
Healthcare plan.)
If you are a member
of a Molina Healthcare plan, please read Molina Healthcare’s applicable Notice
of Privacy Practices as described below.
If you do not agree and accept, without limitation or qualification, these Terms of Use, you must exit the Sites immediately.
WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
What Personal Information Do We Collect?
When you visit Molina
Healthcare’s Sites, no personal information—such as your name, date of birth or
telephone number —is collected, unless you provide us with that information
voluntarily, such as when you complete an online form to learn more about
Molina Healthcare’s health plans or other products and services.
When you provide personal information to Molina
Healthcare, you are responsible for the quality and accuracy of that
information. If you choose not to complete a form or provide certain personal
information through the Sites, you may not be able to use certain features of
the Sites
.
How Do We Use Your Personal Information?
If you choose to provide us
with personal information by completing a form on the Sites, emailing us, or
calling the phone number for agents listed on the Sites, we will use that
personal information to (i) respond to your question or request, (ii) communicate
with you about our health care plans via email, and (iii) send information to
you. If you are not a member of Molina Healthcare plan and you have questions
about how we use your personal information, you may contact us at
CPO.Office@MolinaHealthcare.com
.
Do We Disclose Any Personal Information to Outside Parties?
Unless you expressly give us permission in writing to do so, Molina Healthcare will not sell, rent, license, or trade your personal information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.
Disclosures to Third Parties Assisting In Our Operations.
Molina Healthcare may share
your personal information under confidentiality agreements with other companies
that work with, or on behalf of, Molina Healthcare to provide products and
services. These companies may use your personal information to assist Molina
Healthcare in its operations. However, these companies do not have any
independent right to share this information
.
Disclosures Under Special Circumstances.
We may provide information
about you to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process or governmental
regulations, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against
legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to
investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
person, or as otherwise permitted or required by law
.
Business Transfers.
We
may share your personal
information with other business entities in connection with the sale,
assignment, merger or other transfer of all or a portion of Molina Healthcare’s
business to such business entity. We will require any such successor business
entity to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy
.
Secure Website Services
Certain
online services are
available to Molina Healthcare members via our Secure Website Services, such as
MyMolina.com, and Secure Mobile Applications (collectively, “Secure Services”).
When using such Secure Services, you may disclose personal information to
Molina Healthcare. Molina Healthcare may collect your personal information for
the following
:
The Secure Services require a password to log in before accessing information, thus you may need to provide certain personal information so that Molina Healthcare may verify your identity;
To use and share your personal information to provide you with your healthcare benefits or other products and services; and
To respond to requests via email or any type of communication provided via the Secure Services.
Molina Healthcare complies
with the applicable requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Users of Molina Healthcare's Secure Services
should read Molina Healthcare's applicable Notice of Privacy Practices, which
explains in more detail how we use and disclose your protected health
information (“PHI”). The Notice of Privacy Practices includes information about
how to request access to your PHI, how to request an amendment to your PHI, and
how to file a privacy complaint. For a copy of the Notice of Privacy Practices,

Health Insurance Exchange – Molina Healthcare Marketplace Plans
Molina
Healthcare offers
Marketplace plans in many of the states where we do business. These are also
known as Exchange plans. If you wish to enroll in a Molina Healthcare
Marketplace plan you must complete an enrollment form and provide certain
personally identifiable information (“PII”). If you do not provide the PII
requested in the enrollment form, you will not be enrolled in a Molina
Healthcare Marketplace plan
.
Enhanced Direct Enrollment (EDE)
Molina
Healthcare
participates as an EDE entity by way of an agreement with the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS), which allows Molina Healthcare and its authorized
EDE partner, Health Sherpa, to submit consumer application information
collected directly from consumers to the Federally-facilitated Marketplaces for
an eligibility determination, without requiring consumers to submit Marketplace
application information through HealthCare.gov.  If you choose to apply
for coverage through Molina Healthcare’s EDE partner, Health Sherpa, using its
website, your activity will also be governed by the security and privacy
policies found at
https://www.healthsherpa.com/privacy_notice
.
You may request that we limit the collection,
creation, disclosure, access, maintenance, storage and use of your PII
submitted through our EDE partner for the sole purpose of our assisting
you in applying for health insurance or obtaining an eligibility determination,
facilitating payment for your first premium, assisting you in updating or
canceling your enrollment in a health insurance plan, and for performing other
authorized functions specified in our agreements with CMS. You may request
such a limitation by sending an email to
CPO.Office@MolinaHealthcare.com
.
Internet Protocol Addresses
You
should also be aware that
when you visit our Sites, Molina Healthcare may collect certain information
that does not identify you personally, but provides us with "usage
data," such as the number of visitors we receive or what pages are visited
most often. This data helps us to analyze and improve the usefulness of the
information we provide on these websites
.
Cookies and Web Beacons
Like
most commercial website
owners, we may also use what is known as "cookie" technology. A
"cookie" is an element of data that a website can send to your
browser when you link to that website. It is not a computer program and has no
ability to read data residing on your computer or instruct it to perform any
step or function. By assigning a unique data element to each visitor, the
website is able to recognize repeat users, track usage patterns and better
serve you when you return to that site. The cookie does not extract other
information about you, such as your name or address. Most browsers provide a
simple procedure that will enable you to control whether you want to receive
cookies by notifying you when a website is about to deposit a cookie file
.
On
some pages of the Sites
there may also be use of action tags, sometimes referred to as web beacons or
1x1 pixel graphics interchange format ("GIF") images. Such tags are
used to monitor and assess the effectiveness of promotions and marketing. These
tags work in combination with cookies, but do not collect or contain any
personal information.
Molina Healthcare may use pixels or other online tracking technologies to collect personal information about visitors on certain Sites. This information may include demographic or technical information, and/or web browser data, such as your IP address and browsing behavior. We may also use your information in order to provide information or advertising to those visitors about certain Molina Healthcare services, benefits plans, and/or provider networks
.
Links on the Sites
The
Sites may contain links to
other websites. Please be aware that Molina Healthcare is not responsible for
the privacy practices of such other websites. When you connect to a website
that is linked to our Sites, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of
that website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by
the Sites
.
Response to “Do Not Track” Signals
Some
Internet browsers include
the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals. Since uniform standards for “Do
Not Track” signals have not yet been adopted, Molina Healthcare does not process
or respond to “Do Not Track” signals
.
Children's Privacy Protection
Under Age 13
The
Sites are not designed for,
or intentionally targeted at, children under 13 years of age. It is not our
policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the
age of 13 who is not a member of Molina Healthcare plan. No one under the age
of 13 should submit any personal information to Molina Healthcare or the Sites
.
Under Age 18
Minors
under 18 years of age who
are not members of a Molina Healthcare plan may have the personal information
that they have provided to Molina Healthcare through the Sites deleted by
sending an email to
CPO.Office@MolinaHealthcare.com
requesting deletion. Please note that, while we
make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal
information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data
from all systems
.
Data Retention
Molina
Healthcare retains personal information of visitors to the Sites to the extent
required by applicable law, government contracts and in accordance with its
data retention and destruction policy. We securely destroy such personal
information when applicable retention periods have expired.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
This
Privacy Policy may be
revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change,
and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. We display an
effective date on the policy in the bottom left corner of this Privacy Policy,
following the Terms & Conditions of Use, 
so that it will be easier for you to know when there has been a change.
If we make any change to this Privacy Policy regarding use or disclosure of personal
information, we will provide advance notice on the Sites. Small changes or
changes that do not significantly affect individual privacy interests may be
made at any time and without prior notice
.
Online Security
Molina
Healthcare uses reasonable
and appropriate security measures to safeguard the information that has been
collected from you via the public Sites or Secure Services. Among the measures
that Molina Healthcare has implemented for its websites and mobile applications
are administrative, physical and technical safeguards. However, you should know
that no website operator, including Molina Healthcare, can fully eliminate
security risks associated with personal information. While Molina Healthcare
has endeavored to create secure and reliable Sites for users, the
confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from the Sites
or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed
.
