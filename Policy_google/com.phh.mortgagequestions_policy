 you marketing-related messages without your express consent.

Aggregated Usage Tracking
Aggregated usage tracking is conducted through the use of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and cookies, as described below. Such information enables us to tailor our content to fit Customers' needs better and to help our advertisers understand our audience.
 We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify an individual.
Use of Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses
An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers known as web servers that "serve up" or display web pages.
We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of Our website. When Customers request pages from PHH Mortgage Services, our servers log the Customers' IP addresses.
 We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Customer's session will be logged, but the Customer will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when we feel it is necessary
 to enforce compliance with Our website terms of use agreement, other terms of service of PHH Mortgage Services, or to protect Our service, Website, customers or others.
Use of Cookies
What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes. This information is stored in a file on your computer. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences so that
 we can use the saved information to facilitate your use of Our Website when you return to Our Website. Our use of cookies does not tell us your individual identity. We never save passwords, social security numbers or credit card information in cookies. The
 use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you'll find that most major websites use them. Cookies are used to recognize you when you visit Our Website more than once so that information doesn't have to be repeatedly gathered. We do not store any
 of your personal information with cookies.
You can delete your cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that Our Website will not function properly if you refuse
 cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing marketing transactions.
You may occasionally get cookies from Our partners. We do not control these cookies. The use of cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
For Our Former Customers
In the event you cease to be a customer of ours for any reason, we will maintain and disclose your information consistent with the privacy policies and practices that apply to our then-current customers. Please note, however, you will no longer receive annual
 Privacy Notices once you cease being a customer of ours. However, we may continue to market to you or share your information with affiliates and non-affiliated entities, unless you opt out.
What happens when you link to a third-party site?
You should be aware that when you are on Our Website you could hyperlink or be directed to other websites that are beyond our control and/or outside Our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may transfer you off Our
 Website. These other websites may include websites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use Our logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other websites may send their own cookies to Customers, collect data, or solicit information.
We does not control such websites, and, therefore, is not responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or advertising they choose to place on such websites. Our inclusion of hyperlinks to these websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on
 such websites or any association with their operators. Our privacy policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond Our control.
Please keep in mind that whenever you give out information online (for example, via message boards or chat) that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect our Customers' information and privacy, we cannot guarantee
 the security of any information you disclose online, and you disclose such information at your own risk.
