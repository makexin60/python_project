2. What Data We Collect
We collect certain data from you directly, like the information you enter yourself, data about your usage, and data from third-party platforms you connect with us. We also collect some data automatically, like information about your device and what parts of our Services you interact with or spend time using.
2.1. Data You Provide to Us
We may collect different data from or about you depending on how you use the Services. When you create an account and use the Services, including through a third-party platform, we collect any data you provide directly, including

We process your email address and once the email is confirmed we send transactional emails depending on specific actions. These emails are to notify you of said actions and are separate from email marketing and promotional emails. If you want to opt-out of these emails you can do so easily from your account settings.
If you give us your consent for email marketing, then we may use your email to notify you about promotions and discounts happening within the app.
b. Profile Data:
You can also choose to provide profile information like a photo, bio (status and info), name, location, interests, story, video streams, or other data. Your Profile Data will be publicly viewable by others. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.

We may obtain certain information through your social media or other online accounts if they are connected to your account in our Services. If you log in to our Services via Google or another third-party platform, we ask for your permission to access certain information about that other account. For example, depending on the platform or service we may collect your name, login email address, gender, and birthday.
Those platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you (via your privacy settings) or the platform or service decide to give us.

We use this data to respond to you and research your question or concern, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
h. Sensitive Data:
Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your Profile such as your sexual orientation, religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your Profile there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on our Services may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive data about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of your information and making this public to other users.

In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
This could include any personal data that Nozy holds about you, depending on the nature of the request or the issue that we are dealing with, including all CCPA Categories listed above

Sharing Data with Advertising and Marketing Partners
We collaborate with trusted marketing service providers, like Facebook, and advertising partners, such as AdMob, for dual purposes:
Advertising:
Serve tailored ads on our platforms based on user preferences.
Marketing:
Display our ads on third-party platforms.
Identify and target potential Nozy users.
Evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.
Understand and enhance user engagement with our services.
Certain personal data, such as your app ID, and ad unit id may be accessed by our partners. However:
The data shared is often in a hashed, non-human readable format to prioritize privacy.
These partners are bound to use this information exclusively as directed by us.
All partnerships undergo a stringent selection process to ensure the utmost safety and respect for personal data.
These partners are GDPR compliant.
For clarity, some reasons we utilize marketing tools include:
Excluding existing Nozy users from campaigns targeting new users.
Showcasing Nozy ads to those who’ve visited but haven’t registered.
Forming a ‘Lookalike Audience’ – identifying potential users with similar profiles.
Including users in a ‘custom audience’ designed for ads matching their interests.
7. Our Policy Towards Age
Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least 18 years old to use the App.
Nozy does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors, or anyone under the age of majority. If we become aware that a child, minor, or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal data, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Profile information from Nozy. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.
Service Providers:
We use third-party service providers to carry out moderation services to improve app quality and enforce our age policy.
We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only provide them with the personal data necessary for the service they are providing. Our suppliers are also subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention limits.
8. Data Retention
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we implement a safety retention window of 6 months following account deletion unless there is a technical difficulty. During this period, account information will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on the services anymore.
When you delete your account or it is deactivated by us, we make sure it is no longer viewable on the App. For up to 28 days it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally deleted or wrongfully deactivated. After 28 days, we begin the process of deleting your personal information from our systems.
In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon the deletion of your account (following the safety retention window) or after 10 years of continuous inactivity. An account is considered inactive when the Application of the Member has not established contact with servers, and the Member has not used the Application. In any event, the Account of a Premium Member is not considered inactive.
Unless:
We must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make purchases within the App, some personal data may need to be kept for tax and accounting purposes);
we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy, and other similar consents are kept for five years);
there is an outstanding issue, claim, or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or
the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.
Correspondence with our Customer Support team will be retained for longer to allow us to deal with any subsequent queries you may have but will usually be deleted within 6 years if there are no queries.
Anonymized information about activity on our Services is retained for longer periods of time for statistical and product research purposes but this is not attributable to an individual once the profile has been deleted.
Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due to technical constraints. The deleted data may also be available for up to 72 hours due to caching systems and the interconnection of proxy servers. Some of your data like photos may be in cache for 30 days since the CDN service is renewed every 30 days.
9. Data Protection and Security
We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately and contact
customerdesk@nozy.live
with any concerns.
We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices to update our physical, technical, and organizational security measures.
We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately.
We are not responsible for virus protection outside our service network. We are also not responsible for the damage or destruction of user data. We will pursue every detected attack by hackers, etc. under civil law and, if necessary, by the prosecution.
In case of a breach, we will notify; the EU representatives, our DPO, and our users who were or potentially were affected by the breach within 72 hours of the attack. We will get in contact via email thus, it is important that you sign up with a valid email address that you often check so you are notified of any harmful attacks that may occur.
10. Your Rights
You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and the collection of your data by certain analytics providers.

Rights related to automated decision-making including profiling: there are several rights in this area where processing carried out on a solely automated basis results in a decision that has legal or significant effects for the individual. In these circumstances, your rights include the right to ensure that there is human intervention in the decision-making process.
The particular rights which are applicable to you (which might include other rights not listed above) may vary depending on your country. You should make yourself aware of the rights you have under applicable privacy laws in your country.
We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:

Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify, or delete information that you provided to us, and that’s associated with your account directly within the service.
Device permissions:
Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as gallery, camera and microphone permissions as well as push notifications.

We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:
Reviewing your information:

If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, please contact us via
customerdesk@nozy.live
.
For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.
Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.
Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.
Uninstall:
You can stop all information collected by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you reinstall the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier from your previous transactions and activities.
Accountability:
In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work, or where we are established.

If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service. If we become aware that a child, minor, or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal data, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their profile information from our Services. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rule, we may retain basic account and profile information to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new profile.
12. International Transfer Policy

Specifically, personal data collected in Switzerland and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) is transferred and stored outside those areas.
That data is also processed outside of Switzerland and the EEA by our group companies, or our service providers, including to process transactions, facilitate payments and provide support services. We have entered into data processing agreements with our service providers that restrict and regulate their processing of your data on our behalf. By submitting your data or using our Services, you consent to this transfer, storage, and processing by us and its processors. We operate a global network of servers including in Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Canada. Data collected by advertising partners may also be held outside the European Economic Area. We ensure that the data is adequately protected by ensuring that valid, legal mechanisms are in place. For European users, if your data is transferred internationally (outside of the EEA), we rely on standard contractual clauses and additional security measures in line with the relevant clauses in the GDPR and the relevant caselaw.
