Right now, we don't track your location, but you might tell us where you live when you set up your account.
Third-Party Services
Our app leverages several advanced third-party tools and services to deliver a seamless and highly personalized journaling experience. Below is a detailed overview of the key third-party services we utilize and how they integrate with Onsen's infrastructure:
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
We rely on AWS for robust cloud storage and computing solutions, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security. Our infrastructure within AWS includes several services. This is a non-exhaustive list of the main services we use to power Onsen:
