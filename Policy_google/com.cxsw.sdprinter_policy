              request (refer to the "
Right to Object
" section in Chapter 6, "

Right:
You have the right to not be subject to a decision based solely
              on automated decision-making (decisions made without human involvement), including
              profiling, if that decision would have a legal or similarly significant effect on you.

              type
              of automated decision-making when providing Creality Cloud Products and
              Services. Therefore, your right in this regard is already respected. If you

4. Sharing Your Personal Data
We may share your personal data with third parties in the following
              circumstances:
- With your consent or at your direction
- With service providers who assist us in operating the
              Platform and
              providing
              our services
- With business partners and affiliates for joint marketing
              purposes (if you
              have provided consent)
- In response to legal requests or to comply with applicable
              laws and
              regulations
- To protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights,
              property, or
              safety
              of others.
5. Data Retention
We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the
              purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period
              is
              required or permitted by law. We will also retain and use your personal data
              as
              necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
              enforce
              our agreements.
6. Data Security
We take appropriate measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized
              access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, please note that no
              method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100%
              secure.
              Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
              your
              personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
7. Transfer to Other Countries
Due to the global nature of our business, Creality Cloud may share personal
              data
              internationally with Creality Cloud affiliated companies, subcontractors,
              and
              partners when conducting the data processing activities described in this
              Policy.
When transferring personal data internationally, we ensure that the data
              transfer complies with applicable laws. We also take measures to guarantee
              an
              adequate level of data protection when transferring your information outside
              of
              the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland. These measures include:
1. Adequacy Decisions:
We transfer personal data to
              countries outside
              the
              European Economic Area ("
EEA
") that have sufficient laws to protect
              personal
              data, as determined by the European Commission under Article 45 of the GDPR
              (or
              equivalent decisions under other laws). For example, we may transfer the
              personal data described in Chapter 1 (Personal Data We Collect) to vendors
              based
              in Japan and the Republic of Korea.
2. Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs"):
The European
              Commission has
              approved
              contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allow companies in the
              EEA
              to transfer data outside the EEA to countries without an adequacy decision.
              These clauses, known as SCCs, ensure the protection of personal data. For
              example, we utilize SCCs to transfer the personal data described in Chapter
              1
              (Personal Data We Collect) to our data hosting provider located in the US.
              You
              can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by
              contacting us
              at teamcloud@creality.com.
8. Children
The Creality Cloud Platform is not intended for use by children under the age
              of
              13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we
              become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13
              without
              parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information. If you
              believe
              that we may have collected personal data from a child under 13, please
              contact
              us using the information provided in Section 9.

              Policy periodically for any updates. Your continued use of the Platform
