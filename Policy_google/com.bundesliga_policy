Privacy Statement and Cookie Directive
Privacy statement and cookie policy
for the Official Bundesliga app ('
App
') for DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH, Guiollettstrasse 44-46, 60325 Frankfurt am Main, Germany ('
the DFL
').
The DFL processes and uses personal data collected and stored during the installation and use of the App in compliance with the data privacy regulations applicable in the Federal Republic of Germany. This privacy statement and cookie policy (hereinafter collectively referred to as '
the Statement
') sets out which personal data regarding users (hereinafter collectively referred to as '
the User
') is collected and how this data is processed and used.
Permissions
For the App to work correctly, it is necessary for the User to grant the App access to certain functions and data on the user's device. During installation, the User will be asked once to grant the relevant permissions. The way in which permissions are granted varies depending on the device manufacturer. In some cases, access permissions have different names, while individual permission categories are sometimes combined, meaning that the User can approve only the entire permission category. By granting permission, the User consents to his/her data being processed accordingly.
Note that if you do not grant one or more of the permissions requested, some functions of the App may not be usable. If the User nonetheless attempts to activate such a function, the App will again ask the User to grant permission. The User can at any time use the device settings to revoke permission that has previously been granted.
If the User has granted permission, the DFL will use it as follows:
Push notifications: The App requires permission to send push notifications about clubs and selected events (news, videos and information relating to matchdays and matches, such as goals, cards, substitutions and match start/end) to the User's device.
Files and media: The App requires access to files and media when creating user feedback so that it can access screenshots taken by the User to show problems occurring in the App.
Camera: The App requires access to the camera when creating user feedback so that it can access screenshots taken by the User to show problems occurring in the App.
Data collection and processing during use of the App
2.1 Installation and use of the App
The following data will automatically be logged on the DFL server when the App is installed and used:
IP address of the requesting device
Date and time of installation
Date and time of access
Quantity of data transferred
Access status (file transferred, file not found etc.)
Name and version of operating system used
Type and version of browser used and browser plugins installed
Time zone settings
Identification data of device used
Name of the User's internet service provider and information about the mobile network used
The collection, processing and use of this data occur for the purposes of enabling the use of the App, system security and the technical administration of the network infrastructure. The data will not be compared with other sets of data or passed on to third parties either in whole or in part.
The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation ('
GDPR
'). The DFL's legitimate interest is based on the aim of providing the User with a secure and functioning App.
2.2 Crashlytics
In the App, the DFL uses Crashlytics, a service of Google LLC (USA) ('
Crashlytics
') that collects information about user behaviour and the devices used so as to diagnose and resolve potential problems with the App. This data is stored anonymously. However, data may be transferred to the USA as part of the process. More detailed information about Firebase Crashlytics can be found via the following
link
and in
Firebase Crashlytics’s privacy policy
.
The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) GDPR. The DFL's legitimate interest is based on the aim of providing the User with the most stable App possible.
2.3 Analysis of the use of the App and its content
Additional reference is made to Clause 4 with regard to the collection and processing of data for analysing the use of the App and its content as well as optimisation of the App through analytical services.
Data collection and processing in the context of registration and login
3.1 Registration and login
The DFL uses the customer identity management platform provided by Okta, Inc., 101 1st Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, (“
Okta
”) for the registration for Bundesliga accounts and the other services offered through them (e.g. Official Bundesliga Fantasy Manager, Bundesliga Newsletter, access to certain editorial content for registered Users) and for the Bundesliga account login.
During registration and the further onboarding process, the DFL asks the Users for the following data:
Full name
E-mail address
Country
Favourite club (optional)
Gender (optional)
Date of birth (optional)
Password
Okta stores and manages this data in Germany but may refer some support queries to international support teams in Australia, Canada, Singapore, Japan and the USA. Insofar as any of these countries does not have the same level of data privacy as the EU and, particularly in the USA, it is possible for security agencies to access personal data stored there to a considerable extent, Okta safeguards this transfer of data by means of EU standard contractual clauses. Further information can be found in
Okta's privacy policy.
All data will be used only for the operation and management of the services subject to registration and to establish, implement, or terminate the underlying agreement with the User on participation in the service(s) he/she has selected. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR, provided the User has given his/her consent to the processing (which can be revoked with future effect at any time), and Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 b) GDPR.
3.2 Social logins
The social login function, which is also provided via Okta (see Clause 3.1), allows the User to log in to the APP for the access to the Services exclusively available for registered Users within the APP with his/her (social media) account with Facebook, Google or Apple. If the User chooses to use one of these social logins, the relevant social media provider will establish the User's identity and transfer the data about the User outlined below to the DFL.
No usage data (pages visited, fields activated) is transferred to the respective provider, since the DFL has implemented the social logins using OAuth (Open Authorization).
The legal basis for the transmission of data is the User's consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR, which the User grants by choosing to use a social login. The User can revoke this consent at any time with future effect. The DFL will then process the transferred data for the purposes of establishing, implementing and terminating the user agreement in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 b) GDPR.
The following privacy information regarding data transfer apply to social logins; see also Clause 7.1 on sharing content.
3.2.1 Facebook
IF THE USER DOES NOT WISH DATA TO BE SYNCHRONISED IN THIS WAY, THE USER MUST USE ONE OF THE OTHER AVAILABLE LOGIN OPTIONS.
3.2.2 Google
If the User logs in via Google, the following types of data transmission from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, ('
Google
') to the DFL will be initiated:
The transmission of certain information from the User's Google account to the DFL with the consequence that in addition to the usage data outlined in this Statement (e.g. IP address), the following information will be transmitted to the DFL:
Profile picture
Full name, as well as
E-mail address
IF THE USER DOES NOT WISH DATA TO BE SYNCHRONISED IN THIS WAY, THE USER MUST USE ONE OF THE OTHER AVAILABLE LOGIN OPTIONS.
3.2.3 Apple
If the User logs in via Apple, the following types of data transmission from Apple Inc., One Apple Park Way, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA, ('
Apple
') to the DFL will be initiated:
The transmission of certain information from the User's Apple account to the DFL with the consequence that in addition to the usage data outlined in this Statement (e.g. IP address), the following information will be transmitted to the DFL:
Full name, as well as
E-mail address
IF THE USER DOES NOT WISH DATA TO BE SYNCHRONISED IN THIS WAY, THE USER MUST USE ONE OF THE OTHER AVAILABLE LOGIN OPTIONS.
3.3 Login status
When the User logs into his/her account in the App, the User’s login details (e-mail address and password) will be saved. Only once the session has expired (because the User has either logged out, deleted the browser history or cleared the cache), after 14 days of inactivity or after six months at the latest will the User have to log in again. The User's login status is stored by means of refresh tokens and deleted after the periods outlined above as soon as the User has to log in again. If the User logs into the App on a device used by more than one person, he/she should make sure to log out again accordingly at the end of the session.
3.4 Special provisions for individual services subject to registration
3.4.1 Newsletter
The User is given the option of subscribing to newsletters of the DFL (Bundesliga Newsletter and Game Updates) when registering his/her Bundesliga account.
The registration for the subscription is processed via Okta. The service of Mapp Digital Germany GmbH (Germany) is used for the dispatch of newsletters and the associated management of User data.
The DFL will place what is known as a tracking pixel in the HTML code of the respective newsletter and assign a user ID to the User to determine the time at which the respective newsletter was opened and which links or functions were activated from that newsletter. This tracking takes place for the purpose of internal optimisation of the respective newsletter. This data will not be passed on.
The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR. If the User does not want this tracking to take place, he/she can unsubscribe from the respective newsletter (e.g. via the unsubscribe link in each newsletter or through the account settings).
3.4.2 Official Fantasy Manager
The User agrees that in the event that he/she wins, the DFL may, at its discretion, publish the User’s first name, the first letter of the User’s surname and the User’s country of residence through the official DFL tele media and/or social media accounts, while the User’s first name and the first letter of the User’s surname will also be made publicly accessible on the Official Fantasy Manager rankings, on the official websites
www.bundesliga.de
and
www.bundesliga.com
as well as the Official Fantasy Bundesliga App. Processing for this purpose is permitted on the basis of the User's consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR and the User may revoke this consent at any time with future effect.
3.4.3 Newsletters from partners and licensees
If the User has declared consent for this, the DFL will provide the his/her data (salutation, full name, e-mail address, and country, as well as time and date stamp of the registration and its confirmation via “double opt-in”) to certain partners and licensees so that they can provide the User with information on products and other services via e-mail. Users currently have the option of registering for the newsletters of the following partners and licensees:
TIPICO Services Ltd. (the DFL only provides TIPICO Services Ltd. with the data of Users who have voluntarily entered their date of birth during registration and for whom this data indicates that they have reached the age of 18 years),
Sky Deutschland Fernsehen GmbH & Co. KG
Topps Europe Holdings Ltd.
The DFL has no further knowledge in regard to how the partners/licensees in question process this data, and refers to the respective data protection provisions of the partners and licensees specified above.
The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR. The User can revoke such consent with future effect at any time (e.g. by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in the newsletter in question or by contacting the respective partner/licensee directly via the contact details specified in the imprint).
Data collection and processing in the context of analysis of use of the App and its contents by means of Matomo
For the App, the DFL uses Matomo, an open-source analytics application developed by InnoCraft Ltd, New Zealand, ('Matomo') to analyse use of the App and its content. This application is installed locally on the DFL servers. The following data is collected and stored using the SDK (software development kit) provided by Matomo:
Pseudonymised visitor ID
App page accessed
Sub-pages accessed within the App
Time spent on individual App pages
Frequency and timing of App page access
Interactions with the App, such using buttons or watching videos
Using the IP2Location™ IP-Country-Region-City-ISP Database [DB4] features from Hexasoft Development Sdn Bhd, Malaysia, ('ip2location') likewise installed locally on the DFL servers, additional geolocation information (country, region, town or city) is also collected and stored cumulatively on the basis of IP addresses.
Collection and storage take place only on the DFL servers. The data will not be passed on to Matomo or any other third parties.
Matomo and ip2location are set up to ensure that IP addresses are not stored in their entirety; instead, two bytes of each IP address are masked (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx). This renders it impossible to attribute the abbreviated IP address to the specific device used. A User can prevent such an analysis by choosing to opt out in this privacy section or in the App settings.
However, the DFL hereby informs the User that in this case, it is possible that the User may not be able to use all functions of this App to their fullest extent.
Further information on privacy can be found in
Matomo's privacy policy
.
The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) GDPR, with the DFL's legitimate interest in processing being evaluating the App data for the purposes of optimising it.
Reference is made to Clause 8.1 with regard to the use of the data collected by Matomo as part of the analysis of the use of the App and its content for the purpose for the determination of the User's interests for the sending of personalised push notifications and to Clause 8.2 with regard to the use of such data for the purpose of recommending editorial articles in accordance with Clause 4.
Google Ad Manager for showing online advertisements
The DFL uses Google Ad Manager from Google LLC (USA) ('
Google
') for placing online advertisements in the App. This allows the DFL to show certain advertisements to the User. The DFL does not place personalised advertisements from third-party provider networks but only advertisements marketed directly by the DFL. Further information can be found via the following
link
and in
Google's privacy policy
.
The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) GDPR, with the DFL's permission arising from the fact that it wishes to deploy its efforts involved in operating the App for direct advertising as well and that the User will not be at any particular disadvantage as a result of this, considering the User's reasonable expectations based on his/her relationship with the DFL as the operator of the App.
Social media content
Some content that the DFL has published on its official social media accounts on Facebook, X, Instagram and YouTube will be loaded in the App via WebView (e.g. in articles or the live ticker). Cookies will be used in the process. More details about the cookies used can be found in Clause 9.2 'Cookies'.
Further information on data processing by the providers can be found in the applicable privacy statements:
Facebook
,
X
,
Instagram
and
YouTube
(the DFL embeds content from the latter in privacy-enhanced mode; find out more
here
).
With regard to the sharing of App content via social media services, see also Clause 7.1.
Sharing content
The DFL provides users of the App with the opportunity to share the App's content as described in the following section.
7.1 Using the Facebook, X, Google+ and WhatsApp social media services
Users can share content from this App on the social media services provided by Facebook, X, Google+ and WhatsApp. To prevent User data being shared with the providers without the User's consent, the DFL offers only social sharing links in the App. This ensures that no data will be transferred to third parties without the permission of the User. Only when the User activates the social media services by clicking the relevant icon, thereby consenting to connect with Facebook, X, Google+ and WhatsApp, will a connection to the applicable service be established and the social sharing links created, and the User can then publish these links through the service. Further information on data processing by the providers can be found in the applicable privacy statements:
Facebook
,
X
,
Google+
and
WhatsApp
.
7.2 E-mail forwarding
The User can also share and recommend content from this App via e-mail by clicking the relevant button. The DFL will not use, process or store in any way the recipient e-mail addresses that the User enters in the e-mail application that opens when the User clicks the relevant icon.
7.3 Sharing via Android and iOS
If a User uses an Android or iOS device and clicks the Share button, the App will – in addition to the aforementioned social media platforms and e-mail forwarding function – show all applications that are installed on the User's device and that offer a share function. The DFL has no influence on which data is shared with the corresponding platforms and recommends referring to the respective privacy statements.
Additional services and functions
8.1 Push notifications
The DFL uses Amazon Pinpoint, a technology from Amazon Web Services, Inc., 410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, USA, and its European subsidiary Amazon Web Services EMEA Sàrl, Rue Plaetis 5, 2338 Luxembourg, Luxembourg, ('
AWS
') to send push notifications about clubs and selected events (in particular news, videos and information relating to matchdays and matches, such as goals, cards, substitutions and match start/end, live broadcasting) via the iOS and Android native interfaces. This will take place only if the User has consented to corresponding push notifications when first launching the App or later in the App settings.
If the User has not opted out of the use of Matomo in accordance with Clause 4, the DFL will use the data collected for the purpose of personalised push notifications in accordance with Clause 4. These personalised push notifications are intended to suggest editorial articles that would potentially appeal to users based on their interests and browsing histories and to make them aware of events (e.g. live broadcasts) that may interest them. If the User has opted out, the only pieces of information that the DFL will process about the User for the purpose of delivering push notifications will be whether the User has consented to push notifications, which language has been selected and the clubs and events about which the User would like to receive push notifications.
The legal basis for sending push notifications is the User's consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR. The User can revoke this consent at any time by disabling push notifications again in the App or device settings. The legal basis for determining the User's interests for the purpose of sending personalised push notifications is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) of the GDPR, according to which the DFL's legitimate interest lies in referring the User to further events and information that may interest him/her.
8.2 Recommended editorial articles
The DFL uses the data collected by Matomo in accordance with Clause 4 as part of the analysis of the use of the App and its content for the purpose of suggesting editorial articles that would potentially appeal to the User based on his/her interests and use of the App and its content via the separation 'Recommended for you' section.
If the User has opted out of the use of Matomo in accordance with Clause 4, the most popular articles in general will be shown instead. If the User does not wish to be shown any recommended editorial articles at all, he/she can disable them in the App in this privacy section.
The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) GDPR. The legitimate interest in this case consists of the evaluation of these data for the purpose of optimising the content and services of the App as well as the objective of highlighting the most interesting content possible for the User.
8.3 Playing videos
The DFL embeds videos in the App using JW Player software from Longtail Ad Solutions, Inc. (USA). JW Player does not process any user data, and it records only the video play counts.
For legal reasons, the DFL is not permitted to make the videos shown in the App available in certain countries. To ensure this, when the User selects a video, the GeoLite2 feature from Maxmind, Inc. (USA) installed locally on DFL servers is used to determine the countries in which the relevant video may be played and to compare this list against the current location of the User's device, identified via the IP address of the User's device. On this basis, the App checks whether the video is permitted to be played in the country in which the User's device is currently located or whether it must be disabled for legal reasons. In the latter case, the User will be shown only a notice to that effect instead of the video. This information will remain intact only for the duration of this check on the device and will then be deleted; furthermore, it will not be stored or transferred to a back-end system.
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) GDPR. The legitimate interest of the DFL is based on compliance with the existing contractual agreements with its national and international licensees for the media rights to the matches of the Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2.
8.4 'TV partners' section
In the 'TV partners' section, the User can find out about the broadcaster through which the Bundesliga can be followed live in the country in which the User is currently located. To direct the User to the correct broadcaster, the IP address of the User's device is used to determine the appropriate country. This information will then be stored locally as a default setting on the User's device until the User logs in with an IP address from a different country, changes the setting manually or uninstalls the App. This information will not be transferred to the DFL servers or to any third parties.
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) GDPR. The legitimate interest of the DFL is based on informing the User of how he/she can watch Bundesliga matches live at his/her current location.
8.5 Zendesk
The DFL uses the ticket system of Zendesk Inc. (USA) ('
Zendesk
') to respond to enquiries that have been submitted as well as to process problems with the App reported by users.
Information on how Zendesk processes data can be found in the
Zendesk privacy policy
.
Zendesk also processes user data in the USA, which does not have the same level of data privacy as the EU. In particular, in the USA, it is possible for security agencies to access personal data stored there to a considerable extent. Zendesk ensures security for this data transfer to the USA by means of its approved internal Zendesk Binding Corporate Rules in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 b) GDPR. These were approved by the European Data Protection Supervisor on 19 May 2017 and are available online. Zendesk uses the EU's standard contractual clauses as an additional safeguard.
The legal basis for processing is the User's consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR, granted when the User submits an enquiry or report, which the User may revoke at any time, effective from that point onwards.
8.6 Feedback service
The DFL uses the feedback service “GetFeedback” from Momentive Europe UC ('
Momentive
') to provide the User with the opportunity to provide feedback on the App and its functions and to participate in online surveys. The DFL uses the resultant feedback and surveys to improve the App and its functions in line with user requests. When a User uses the feedback form or the feedback button or participates in an online survey, the User’s device will establish a direct link to Momentive’s server and the information entered by the User (e.g. full name, e-mail address), the User's IP address and other device-related information will be transmitted. Further details can be found in
Momentive’s privacy policy
. The legal basis for processing is the User's consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR, which the User may revoke at any time with future effect.
SDKs and cookies used
9.1 SDKs used
With the App, the DFL has implemented some services using SDKs (software development kits). Some of the various SDKs process personal User data by establishing a direct link between the device and the SDK provider when the User opens the App. Users may decline the use of SDKs used for statistical purposes or individual App functions.
For technical reasons, the DFL cannot remove the SDKs in such cases but will merely configure settings to prevent further data being retrieved via the SDKs. However, as the provider of the App, the DFL cannot control which data the SDK providers retrieve (even if settings to that effect forbid data retrieval).
The App incorporates the following SDKs:

9.2 Cookies
Cookies are placed via the social media content integrated via WebView (see Clause 6). Cookies are small text files that are stored on the User's device and enable the device to be recognised. These social media cookies are capable of tracking the User's browser across multiple visited websites and to create a profile of his/her interests. This may have an impact on content and news that the User sees on other websites. Cookies are thus used for purposes including marketing.
Social media cookies are placed via the used WebViews only if the User has consented to the corresponding processing and placement of cookies. The legal basis for the use of these cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR. Users may revoke their consent at any time in the App settings, effective from that point onwards.

Data forwarding to third parties
Aside from the cases outlined, the DFL will forward personal data to third parties only if it is authorised or obliged to do so. This is the case particularly if the DFL transfers personal data to government agencies and authorities in accordance with mandatory national legislation or if forwarding is necessary for the purpose of legal action or criminal prosecution in the event of attacks on network infrastructure. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 c) GDPR in conjunction with Section 24 para. 1 no 1 of the German Federal Data Protection Act [
Bundesdatenschutzgesetz
, “BDSG”].
Storage and deletion of personal data
All stored personal data and pseudonymised usage data will be deleted immediately and permanently as soon as they are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected or if the User demands this, unless the DFL is required or entitled by law to preserve the data. If the DFL is required or entitled by law to preserve the data, the stored personal data and pseudonymised usage data will be permanently deleted upon expiry of the statutory retention periods.
Security
The DFL uses technical and organisational security measures to protect personal User data against accidental or intentional tampering, loss, destruction or access by unauthorised persons. These security measures are regularly adapted in accordance with technological developments. Nonetheless, the DFL advises the User that absolute security can never be guaranteed in online data transmission.
Links to other websites
The App may contain links to other websites. This Statement applies solely to this App. DFL has no influence over content from other providers and does not control whether other providers comply with the applicable data protection regulations or other legal requirements. If a user alerts the DFL to the presence of unlawful content on linked websites, the DFL will remove the links from the App immediately.
Rights of the User
The GDPR grants a number of rights to the User. In particular, the User has
a right of access to personal data concerning themselves (Art. 15 GDPR)
a right to rectification of inaccurate data (Art. 16 GDPR)
a right to erasure of data under the conditions stipulated in Art. 17 GDPR
a right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)
a right to data portability in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR
a right to object to processing, unless this takes place to protect the legitimate interests of the DFL (Art. 21 GDPR).
If data processing is based on the User's consent, the User may revoke this at any time with future effect.
The User can contact the DFL via e-mail to

and to any Developer Feedback to Google and acknowledges that Google
has the unrestricted right to use and exploit such Developer Feedback in any
manner, without attribution, and without any obligations or compensation to
Developer.

Application that Developer makes available for testing
through the Services (collectively, "
Developer Data
"), solely for the
purpose of providing, developing, and maintaining the Services, along with any
related customer or technical support, and as otherwise expressly permitted in
this Agreement. Developer agrees that: (a) the Services depend on the
availability of the Developer Data, and (b) Google will not assume any
responsibility or liability for, or undertake to verify, the legality, accuracy
or completeness of the Developer Data. Google shall have no obligation to
store any Developer Data or Results (as defined below).
2.6 Access by Testers; End Users; Compliance. Developer may use the Services to
grant access to Developer Data or Applications to other users, or Testers.
Developer is solely responsible for determining which users will be granted such
access, or receive an invitation to become a Tester, and for ensuring the
accuracy of any user contact information provided to Google for this purpose.
Developer shall be solely responsible for communicating any terms or conditions
associated with granting access to its Test Applications or any Developer Data.

Applications, including, without limitation, device state information, unique
device identifiers, information relating to the physical location of a device,
and information about how the Application was used. Developer may turn on
features of the Services to allow collection of other information via the
Services, including some personally identifiable information (e.g., a user's
email address), which allows Developers to communicate with users about the
engagement with and functionality of their Applications and to invite them to
become Testers. Developer represents and warrants that Developer is collecting
information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user
engagement with and functionality of Developer's Applications, and to
communicate with users about such engagement and functionality. Developer agrees

the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about the
Applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Testers and the user has
provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information.
Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not
enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers,
driver's license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services.
Developer further agrees it will not invite any user to be a Tester that is
under the age of consent as defined under any applicable laws, rules, or
regulations relating to data collection, including without limitation the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("
COPPA
"), the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27
April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation or "
GDPR
"), and all other
relevant laws and regulations. At all times during the term of this Agreement,
Developer shall maintain a privacy policy: (a) that is readily accessible to
users from its website or within its online service (as applicable), (b) that
fully and accurately discloses to its users what information is collected about
its users, and (c) that states that such information is disclosed to and

Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to
track users' activity and otherwise collect information from users. In addition,
when using the Firebase App Distribution Service, Developer shall maintain
contact information that shall be available to its Testers to obtain any
necessary information regarding the processing and handling of Tester
information. Developer authorizes Google to share such contact information with
any Tester or end user for the purposes of addressing questions regarding the
processing and handling of personal data, including requests referenced in the
Data Processing and Security Terms, Section 9.2.1. For Developer's users in the
European Union, Developer shall provide such users with clear notice of, and
obtain such users' consent to, the transfer, storage, and use of their
information in the United States and any other country where Google, or any
third party service providers acting on its behalf, operates, and shall further
notify such users that the privacy and data protection laws in some of these
countries may vary from the laws in the country where such users live. Unless
otherwise specified in writing by Google, Google does not intend use of the
Services to create obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, as amended ("HIPAA"), and makes no representations that the
Services satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a "covered entity"
or "business associate" as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the Services for
any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information
to Google unless you have received prior written consent to such use from
Google. Developer shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations relating to data collection, privacy and security, including without
limitation, COPPA, GDPR, and all other such laws and regulations. Developer will
obtain and maintain any required consents necessary and will comply with any
other applicable requirements to permit the processing of Developer Data under
this Agreement.
2.7 Developer Systems. Developer is responsible for providing: (a) all
equipment, subscriptions and credentials necessary for Google to receive
the Developer Data, and (b) all modems, servers, devices, storage, software
(other than Software), databases, network and communications equipment and
ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the Services
at its facility (collectively, "
Developer Systems
"). Developer shall ensure
that Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all
configurations and specifications described in the Documentation.
2.8 Limitations. Google will not be responsible or liable for any failures
in the Services or any other problems which are related to: (a) the Developer
Data or Developer Systems, or (b) any satellite, telecommunications, network or
other equipment or service outside of Google's facilities or control.
2.9 Confidentiality. "

disclosed by one party ("
Discloser
") to the other party
("
Recipient
") that is marked or otherwise identified as "confidential"
or "proprietary," or by its nature or the circumstances of disclosure should
reasonably be understood to be confidential, including without limitation, all
financial, business or technical information disclosed in relation to this
Agreement. Except for the specific rights granted by this Agreement, the
Recipient may not use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the
Discloser without Discloser's prior written consent, and shall use no less than
reasonable care to safeguard Discloser's Confidential Information, including
ensuring that Recipient's employees, contractors and agents
("Representatives")with access to Discloser's Confidential Information have a

party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its
Representatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser's request at any time,
Recipient shall, or in the case of Developer Data shall use reasonable efforts
to, return all of Discloser's tangible Confidential Information, permanently
erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all
information, records, copies, summaries, analyses and materials developed
therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from disclosing any of the
other's Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order or
any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation;
provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable
efforts to: (i) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to
disclose where permitted by law, and (ii) cooperate with Discloser in
protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or obtaining a
protective order.

").
SECTION 3. ACCESS FOR TESTERS

SECTION 4. WARRANTY, LIABILITY & INDEMNITY
4.1 Warranties. Google represents and warrants that it has full right,
power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its
obligations and duties under this Agreement, and that the performance of such
obligations and duties does not conflict with or result in a breach of any
other agreement of Google, or any judgment, order, or decree by which such
party is bound. Developer's sole and exclusive remedy for any and all breaches
of this provision is the remedy set forth in Section 4.4. Developer represents
and warrants that it owns all right, title and interest, or possesses
sufficient license rights, in and to the Developer Data as may be necessary to
grant the rights and licenses, and provide the representations, and for
Google to provide the Services set forth herein. Developer bears all
responsibility and liability for the legality, accuracy and completeness of the
Developer Data and Google's access, possession, distribution, and use
thereof, as permitted herein.
4.2 Disclaimers. THE SERVICES, GOOGLE PROPERTIES AND RESULTS
ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, GOOGLE AND ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, RELATED
COMPANIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, PARTNERS
AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "GOOGLE ENTITIES") MAKE NO WARRANTY: (A)
THAT THE SERVICES OR RESULTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE UNINTERRUPTED,
ERROR FREE OR BUGFREE, (B) REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, OR
PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, OR (C) THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICES CAN OR WILL
BE CORRECTED. THE GOOGLE ENTITIES HEREBY DISCLAIM (FOR THEMSELVES AND
THEIR SUPPLIERS) ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES
ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.
4.3 Claims Against Google. Developer will defend Google from all
third party claims, whether actual or alleged (collectively, "
Google
Claims
"), and will indemnify Google and hold Google harmless from
any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from such Google Claims that arise
out of Developer's: (a) use of the Services, (b) actual or alleged infringement
or misappropriation of the rights of any third party, including, without
limitation, any intellectual property rights, privacy rights or publicity
rights, and (c) breach of any representations and warranties set forth in the
Agreement. Developer is solely responsible for defending any such Google
Claims, subject to Google's right to participate with counsel of its own
choosing, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
resulting from such Claims against Google, provided that Developer will
not agree to any settlement related to any such Google Claims without
Google's prior express written consent regardless of whether or not such
settlement releases Google from any obligation or liability. If Developer
uses the Services in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a
United States federal, state, or local government entity and is legally unable
to accept this indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such
entity, but only to the extent required by applicable law.
4.4 Claims Against Developer. Google will defend the Developer from all
third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged
(collectively, "
Developer Claims
"), and will indemnify Developer and
hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs,
and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from such
Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Services, when used
as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property
rights of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Google will
have no obligation under this Section 4.4 or otherwise with respect to any
infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Services not expressly
permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Services in combination with
products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Google if
such infringement would have been avoided without the combination with such
other products, equipment, software, or data; (c) any modification of the
Services by any person other than Google or its authorized agents or
subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Services itself. This
Section 4.4 states Google's entire liability and Developer's sole and
exclusive remedy for all third party claims.
4.5 Procedure. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking
indemnification: (a) promptly notifying the other party in writing of such
claim; (b) giving the other party sole control of the defense thereof and any
related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at the other party's
request and expense, assisting in such defense. Neither party may make any
public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other
party's prior written approval. The indemnifying party may not settle,
compromise or resolve a claim without the consent of the indemnified party, if
such settlement, compromise or resolution (i) causes or requires an admission
or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (i) imposes any monetary
damages against the indemnified party, or (iii) does not fully release the
indemnified party from liability with respect to the claim.
4.6 Limitation of Liability.
(a) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY
LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL OR FOR INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR
CORRUPTION OF DATA OR NETWORKS.
(b) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIFTY ($50.00) DOLLARS (USD).
(c) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY
OBLIGATIONS OR FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS, AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED
HEREIN.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY AND
ALL CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to You. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON
LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH
APPLICABLE LAW.
SECTION 5. TERM AND TERMINATION
5.1 Term. The term of this Agreement will begin on the date you first agree to
this Agreement and are approved to register for the Services, and continue
until terminated as set forth herein ("Term"). Your use of the Services may be
terminated by Google or you at any time, for any reason, effective
immediately upon notice provided by one party to the other party as set forth
herein.
5.2 Effects of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this
Agreement, all rights, obligations and licenses of the parties shall cease,
except that: (a) all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of
termination and all remedies for breach of this Agreement shall survive, (b)
you must discontinue accessing and using the Services and delete all Software
and Google Properties, and (c) the provisions in
Section 2 titled Restrictions, Developer Feedback, Confidentiality, Proprietary
Rights, General Learning; Aggregate Data, the provisions of Section 4 and the
provisions in this Section 5 shall survive. Unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement (including the Data Processing and Security Terms), Google has no
obligation to store, delete or return any User Feedback, Performance Data,
Developer Data, or Results.
SECTION 6. MISCELLANEOUS
6.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (which includes any order form completed
by Developer) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
negotiations, understandings, or agreements (oral or written), between the
parties about the subject matter of this Agreement.
6.2 Waivers, Consents and Amendments. No waiver, consent, or modification of
this Agreement shall bind the Google Entities unless in writing and signed
by Google. Google may amend this Agreement from time to time. If we
make a change to this Agreement that, in our sole discretion, is material, we
will notify you at the email address that you provided upon signing up to
access the Services or otherwise through the Services. If you do not
agree to the modified terms, you shall notify Google in writing within
thirty (30) days, after which your right to access and use the Services shall
immediately terminate and the Google Entities shall have no further
responsibility or liability to you. The failure of either party to enforce its
rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as
a waiver of such rights.
6.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be
illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full
force and effect and enforceable.
6.4 Governing Law and Disputes. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without
regard to its conflicts of law provisions.
(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.4(b) below, all claims arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Services ("
Disputes
") will be
governed by California law, excluding California's conflict of laws rules, and
all Disputes will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of
Santa Clara County, California, USA, and You and Google consent to
personal jurisdiction in those courts.
(b) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence
(for individuals) is in any country within APAC (other than Australia, Japan,
New Zealand or Singapore) or Latin America, this Section 6.4(b) will apply
instead of Section 6.4(a) above. ALL DISPUTES (AS DEFINED ABOVE) WILL BE
GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA'S CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES.The
parties will try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the
Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it must be
resolved by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association's International
Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules
in force as of the date of this Agreement ("
Rules
"). The parties will
mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in
Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any competent
court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution
of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief
consistent with the remedies and limitations in this Agreement. Subject to the
confidentiality requirements in of this Agreement, either party may petition
any competent court to issue any order necessary to protect that party's rights
or property; this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of this
governing law and arbitration section and will not affect the arbitrator's
powers, including the power to review the judicial decision. The parties
stipulate that the courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, are competent
to grant any order under this subsection. The arbitral award will be final and
binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent
court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its
property. Any arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with this section
will be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement's
confidentiality section, including: (i) the existence of, (ii) any information
disclosed during, and (iii) any oral communications or documents related to the
arbitration proceedings. The parties may also disclose the information
described in this section to a competent court as may be necessary to file any
order under this section or execute any arbitral decision, but the parties must
request that those judicial proceedings be conducted in camera (in private).
The parties will pay the arbitrator's fees, the arbitrator's appointed experts'
fees and expenses, and the arbitration center's administrative expenses in
accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine
the non-prevailing party's obligation to reimburse the amount paid in advance
by the prevailing party for these fees. Each party will bear its own lawyers'
and experts' fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator's final decision.
6.5 Force Majeure. In the event that either party is prevented from performing,
or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement (except
payment obligations) due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, the
affected party shall give written notice thereof to the other party and its
performance shall be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform
due to such occurrence.
6.6 Notices. Any notice or communication hereunder shall be in writing and
either personally delivered or sent via confirmed facsimile, confirmed
electronic transmission, recognized express delivery courier or certified or
registered mail, prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to the other
party, which, in the case of Developer, shall be the email address provided to
Google upon signing up for the Services or specified through use of the Services,
and, in the case of Google, shall be Google
LLC 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, with a copy to
Legal Department. All notices shall be in English, and deemed to have been
received when they are hand delivered, or five business days after their
mailing, or upon confirmed electronic transmission or confirmed facsimile
transmission.

be assigned, transferred or delegated, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily
or by operation of law, contract, merger (whether Developer is the surviving or
disappearing entity), stock or asset sale, consolidation, dissolution, through
government action or otherwise, by Developer without Google's prior
written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing shall
automatically be null and void, and Google may immediately terminate this
Agreement upon such an attempt. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure
to the benefit of, any permitted successors, representatives, and permitted
assigns of the parties hereto.
6.8 Independent Contractors. The parties shall be independent contractors under
this Agreement, and nothing herein will constitute either party as the

I. Einführung
Datenschutz ist uns bei Okta wichtig. Diese Okta-Datenschutzrichtlinie („Datenschutzrichtlinie“) beschreibt unsere Datenschutzpraktiken für die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebenen Aktivitäten. Bitte nehmen Sie sich die Zeit, diese Datenschutzrichtlinie sorgfältig zu lesen, um zu verstehen, wie wir personenbezogene Daten („personenbezogene Daten“) sammeln, weitergeben und anderweitig verarbeiten, und um mehr über Ihre Rechte und Möglichkeiten bei der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu erfahren.
Wenn Sie in Kalifornien ansässig sind, lesen Sie bitte den Abschnitt dieser
Datenschutzrichtlinie für Einwohner Kaliforniens
.
In dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie bedeuten „Okta“, „wir“, „unser“ und „uns“ jeweils Okta, Inc. und die entsprechenden Okta-Partner, die an der Verarbeitungstätigkeit beteiligt sind. Die Adressen unserer Büros, in denen sich Okta, Inc. und unsere verbundenen Unternehmen befinden, finden Sie unter
https://www.okta.com/de/contact.
Auth0, Inc. ist eine Tochtergesellschaft von Okta. Alle Erwähnungen der Customer Identity Cloud schließen auch Auth0 von Okta ein.
II. Oktas Rollen und Verantwortlichkeiten
Okta ist der Verantwortliche für Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, wie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschrieben, sofern nicht anders angegeben. Bitte beachten Sie, dass diese Datenschutzrichtlinie nicht gilt, soweit wir personenbezogene Daten in der Rolle eines Verarbeiters (oder einer vergleichbaren Rolle wie „Dienstleister“ in bestimmten Ländern) im Auftrag unserer Kunden verarbeiten. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn wir unseren Kunden verschiedene Cloud-Produkte und -Dienste anbieten, über die unsere Kunden (und/oder ihre verbundenen Unternehmen) ihre eigenen Websites und Anwendungen mit unserer gehosteten Plattform (einschließlich der Services unserer Marke Auth0) verbinden, ihre eigenen Produkte und Dienste verkaufen oder anbieten, elektronische Mitteilungen an andere Personen senden oder anderweitig personenbezogene Daten über unsere Cloud-Produkte und -Dienste sammeln, verwenden, weitergeben oder verarbeiten.
Jeder unserer Kunden, nicht Okta, kontrolliert, ob er Ihnen im Rahmen seines Abonnements einen Account oder einen anderen Zugang für den Okta Identity Cloud-Dienst zur Verfügung stellt. Wenn er Ihnen im Rahmen seines Abonnements einen Account oder einen anderen Zugang zur Verfügung stellt, kontrolliert er, welche Informationen über Sie er an unseren Dienst übermittelt. Dieser Inhalt kann Kontaktinformationen (wie Ihren Vor- und Nachnamen, Ihre E-Mail-Adresse und Ihre Telefonnummer), berufliche Informationen (wie die Abteilung Ihrer Dienststelle, für die Sie arbeiten) oder andere Arten von Informationen enthalten, die ein Kunde übermittelt. Die Verwendung dieser Inhalte durch Okta unterliegt Vereinbarungen zwischen Okta und dem Kunden.
Ausführliche Informationen zum Datenschutz in Situationen, in denen ein Okta-Kunde (und/oder ein verbundenes Unternehmen des Kunden), der die Cloud-Produkte und -Dienste von Okta verwendet, der Controller ist, wenden Sie sich bitte direkt an den jeweiligen Kunden. Wir sind nicht verantwortlich für die Datenschutz- oder Datensicherheitspraktiken unserer Kunden. Diese können von den in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie festgelegten Praktiken abweichen. Sofern in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie oder in einer separaten Offenlegung nicht anders angegeben, verarbeiten wir diese personenbezogenen Daten in der Rolle eines Verarbeiters oder Dienstleisters im Auftrag eines Kunden (und/oder seiner verbundenen Unternehmen), der der verantwortliche Controller der jeweiligen personenbezogenen Daten ist.
Wenn Ihre personenbezogenen Daten von oder im Auftrag eines Okta-Kunden an uns übermittelt wurden und Sie Ihre Rechte gemäß den geltenden Datenschutzgesetzen ausüben möchten, wenden Sie sich bitte direkt an den jeweiligen Kunden. Da wir nur auf Anweisung dieses Kunden auf die Daten eines Kunden zugreifen dürfen, geben Sie uns bitte den Namen des Okta-Kunden an, der uns Ihre personenbezogenen Daten übermittelt hat, wenn Sie Ihre Anfrage direkt an uns richten möchten. Wenn wir den Okta-Kunden verifizieren können, werden wir Ihre Anfrage an diesen Kunden weiterleiten und ihn bei Bedarf bei der Bearbeitung Ihrer Anfrage innerhalb eines angemessenen Zeitraums unterstützen.
Weitere Informationen und Hinweise zu den Datenschutzverpflichtungen von Okta (auch mit Blick auf internationale Übertragungen) gegenüber unseren Kunden finden Sie in unserem Abonnementformular und den zugehörigen Dokumenten, einschließlich unserer Trust & Compliance-Dokumentation, die alle online unter
https://www.okta.com/agreements
verfügbar sind.
III. Von uns gesammelte personenbezogene Daten und Datenquellen
Abgedeckte Datenverarbeitungsaktivitäten
Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten, die wir auf folgende Weise sammeln, wie in diesem Abschnitt beschrieben.
Wir sammeln Informationen über Sie, wenn Sie sie uns zur Verfügung stellen, wenn Sie mit unseren Websites und elektronischen Systemen interagieren, wenn Sie an Veranstaltungen teilnehmen und unsere Büros besuchen und wenn sie uns andere Quellen zur Verfügung stellen, wie weiter unten beschrieben.
Informationen, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen
Basierend auf unseren aktuellen Praktiken (und einschließlich unserer Praktiken in den letzten 12 Monaten) sammeln wir die folgenden Kategorien von Informationen über Sie:
Kontakt- und berufliche Daten.
Wir sammeln Kontakt- und/oder professionelle Daten über Sie persönlich, über Mitteilungen, einschließlich der Kommunikation mit Ihnen oder Ihren Kollegen, und über unsere Websites. Sie geben uns beispielsweise Ihre Kontakt- und Berufsinformationen an, wenn Sie sich anmelden, um mehr über die Produkte und Dienstleistungen von Okta zu erfahren, Inhalte herunterzuladen, sich für eine Veranstaltung anzumelden und unsere Büros zu besuchen. Wenn Sie an einer Veranstaltung teilnehmen, erhalten wir möglicherweise auch Kontakt- und Berufsdaten über Sie, wenn Sie Ihren Teilnehmerausweis scannen oder eine Visitenkarte oder eine andere Methode bereitstellen, mit der Sie uns personenbezogene Daten mitteilen. In der Regel umfassen die Kontaktdaten Ihren Namen und Ihre Kontaktmethoden wie Telefonnummer, E-Mail-Adresse und Ihre geschäftlichen oder anderen Postanschriften. Zu den beruflichen Daten gehören Angaben wie das Unternehmen, mit dem Sie verbunden sind, Ihre Berufsbezeichnung und die Branche.
Administrator-Daten.
Wenn Sie sich für ein Konto anmelden, um Okta zu testen, einen Okta-Dienst über Okta oder eine andere Einrichtung (z. B. einen Marktplatz oder einen autorisierten Wiederverkäufer) abonnieren, die Möglichkeit haben, eine Support-Anfrage einzureichen, oder als Administrator für einen Teil des Okta-Dienstes benannt werden, werden uns Informationen über Sie zur Verfügung gestellt („Administrator-Daten“). Zu den Administrator-Daten gehören in der Regel Ihr Name, Ihre E-Mail-Adresse, Telefonnummer, Adresse, Rechnungsinformationen, geschäftliche Kontaktinformationen, Anmeldeinformationen (einschließlich Okta-Schulungen und -Anmeldeinformationen), von Ihnen gewählte Abonnement- und Service-Optionen und andere Details, die Sie uns über sich selbst mitteilen oder die Sie in Ihren Profilen in Okta-Communities und anderen Support-Portalen angeben. Wir können auch personenbezogene Daten erhalten, die Sie mit uns im Rahmen von Support-Anfragen über die dabei verwendeten Tools (z. B. Videokonferenzen oder andere Kommunikationsmethoden, an denen Sie teilnehmen) teilen.
Biografische, Community- und Support-bezogene Daten.
Wir können auch verschiedene biografische, Community- und Support-bezogene personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen über unser Hilfezentrum und Community-Support-Foren sammeln. Wenn Sie sich beispielsweise für eine von uns gehostete Online-Community registrieren, werden Sie möglicherweise aufgefordert, einen Benutzernamen, ein Foto und/oder biografische Informationen wie Ihren Beruf, den Namen des Unternehmens und Fachgebiete anzugeben. Darüber hinaus können Sie uns personenbezogene Daten zur Verfügung stellen, wenn Sie benutzergenerierte Inhalte erstellen (z. B. durch Posten in einem Forum), Okta Feedback geben oder an interaktiven Funktionen, Schulungen, Online-Umfragen, Wettbewerben, Werbeaktionen und Gewinnspielen, Aktivitäten oder Ereignissen teilnehmen. Okta kann personenbezogene Daten und Administrator-Daten in Verbindung mit Support-Anfragen eines Administrators zum Okta-Service erhalten.
Bewerber-Daten.
Wir erfassen Ihre Kontakt- und Berufsinformationen, einschließlich Ihres Lebenslaufs mit Bildungs- und Arbeitshintergrund, an, wenn Sie sich für eine Stelle bei Okta bewerben. Wir können auch vertrauliche Informationen wie Ihre Sozialversicherungsnummer oder eine andere staatliche Kennung, ethnische Herkunft oder andere personenbezogene Daten erfassen, die Sie uns im Zuge Ihrer Bewerbung zur Verfügung stellen.
Vertrags- und Zahlungsdaten.
Möglicherweise erhalten wir Vertragsdaten (wie Unterschriften) von Ihnen oder Ihrem Unternehmen und verwenden Zahlungsverarbeitungsdienste, um Zahlungs- und Rechnungsinformationen zu erfassen, die personenbezogene Daten wie Rechnungsname, Rechnungsadresse und Zahlungskartendaten in Verbindung mit unseren Produkten und Dienstleistungen enthalten können.
Audio-, elektronische oder visuelle Daten.
Wenn Sie an einer virtuellen oder einer Live-Veranstaltung von Okta teilnehmen oder der Aufzeichnung einer Telefon- oder Videokonferenz zustimmen, können wir diese Veranstaltung oder Konferenz ganz oder in Teilen aufzeichnen. Veranstaltungen können wir auf verschiedene Art und Weise dokumentieren, etwa indem wir Fotos machen, Sie bei der Veranstaltung interviewen oder Ihre Teilnahme an einer Live-Frage-Runde oder anderen interaktiven Gesprächsforen aufzeichnen. Wir verwenden diese Informationen für Geschäfts- und Marketingzwecke, um die Öffentlichkeit besser über Okta und seine Veranstaltungen zu informieren und Erfahrungsberichte über unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen bereitzustellen, soweit dies im Rahmen der geltenden Gesetzgebung gestattet ist.
Consumer-Produkte.
Wenn Sie Verbraucherprodukte von Okta („Okta Consumer Products“) verwenden, können wir verschiedene Arten von Informationen und Inhalten von Ihnen erhalten, die Sie freiwillig weitergeben, darunter Kontaktinformationen (wie Ihren Vor- und Nachnamen, Ihre E-Mail-Adresse und Telefonnummer), zusätzliche Details zur Einrichtung von Multifaktor-Authentifizierungsfaktoren, von Ihnen hochgeladene Inhalte (wie Ausweise oder andere Dokumente) und Informationen über die Websites und Anwendungen, die Sie besuchen und über Okta Consumer Products zur Authentifizierung verwenden. Darüber hinaus erhalten wir weitere Daten, darunter Gerätedaten, Nutzungsdaten und Metadaten, wie unten beschrieben, für die unten beschriebenen Zwecke.
Wenn wir sensible Daten von Ihnen erheben, werden wir Sie je nach Gerichtsbarkeit zusätzlich darüber informieren oder Ihre Zustimmung bei der Erhebung bestätigen, wenn dies im Rahmen der geltenden Gesetzgebung erforderlich ist.
Personenbezogene Daten, die wir über andere Quellen beziehen
Im Rahmen unserer Geschäftstätigkeit (und in den 12 Monaten vor dem Datum des Inkrafttretens dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie) erhalten wir personenbezogene Daten und andere Informationen von anderen Dritten für unsere geschäftlichen oder kommerziellen Zwecke. Diese Informationen variieren und fallen normalerweise in einige wenige Kategorien:
Geschäftliche Kontaktinformationen (wie Name, Berufsbezeichnung, Geschäfts-E-Mail, Telefonnummer und Adresse), Social-Media-Profil (wie LinkedIn oder XING), einschließlich anderer Details zu Ihrem Unternehmen, zu vertrieblichen und zu Marketingzwecken, sowie um Sie besser über die Produkte und Services von Okta zu informieren;
Benutzernamen und Identifizierungsinformationen für Plattformen von Drittanbietern;
Angaben zu Ihnen als Bewerber (einschließlich Ihres Namens, Ihres Lebenslaufs, Ihrer Bildungs- und Arbeitsgeschichte, Informationen zu Ihrer Kriminalgeschichte und Ihres Feedbacks), wie gesetzlich zulässig; und
Daten, die zu Sicherheitszwecken verwendet werden, um unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu schützen.
Wir erhalten Geschäftskontaktinformationen, die personenbezogene Daten für kommerzielle Zwecke enthalten, einschließlich Details zu Ihrem Unternehmen von Dritten für Marketing- und Business Intelligence-Zwecke, z. B. zur Analyse von Geschäftsmöglichkeiten, zur Identifizierung von und Kommunikation mit potenziellen Neukunden und zur Bereitstellung relevanterer Inhalte und Werbung für unser Publikum. In der Regel erhalten wir diese Informationen zu Ihrer Person, im Rahmen der geltenden Gesetzgebung, aus einer überschaubaren Zahl von Quellen: (i) Marketinginitiativen von Drittanbietern, z. B. Veranstaltungen, bei denen wir Sponsor sind, oder Website-Formulare, die von Drittanbietern gehostet werden und möglicherweise Inhalte über uns bereitstellen; (ii) wenn Sie damit einverstanden sind, dass Ihr Teilnehmerausweis bei einer von uns oder einem anderen veranstalteten Veranstaltung gescannt wird; (iii) Unternehmen wie Informationsaggregatoren und Unternehmen, von denen wir Geschäftskontaktinformationen lizenziert haben; (iv) Empfehlungen; oder (v) Wiederverkäufern und Channel-Partnern, darunter auch in Rahmen gemeinsamer Marketingmaßnahmen. In einigen Situationen können wir solche Geschäftskontaktinformationen mit anderen nicht personenbezogenen und personenbezogenen Daten kombinieren, die wir besitzen oder die Sie uns zur Verfügung gestellt haben. Beispielsweise können wir Geschäftskontaktdaten mit Details zu Ihrem Unternehmen kombinieren, z. B. Adresse oder Umsatzbereich, und diese Informationen auf Geschäftsmöglichkeiten analysieren oder diese verwenden, um Ihnen maßgeschneiderte Inhalte zu senden.
Wir erhalten auch personenbezogene Daten zur Bereitstellung von Threat Intelligence sowie um unseren Dienst und die Anwendungen unserer Kunden zu schützen, wie z. B. kompromittierte Website-Anmeldedaten anderer Unternehmen. Wir verwenden diese personenbezogenen Daten für verschiedene Zwecke, z. B. in den Bereichen Security und Betrugserkennung, und um es unseren Kunden zu ermöglichen, die Einstellungen in den Okta-Produkten und -Diensten so zu konfigurieren, dass ihre Administratoren und Nutzer benachrichtigt werden, wenn die Daten, die sie in den Okta-Dienst eingegeben haben, in diesem Datensatz enthalten sind.
Wir erhalten auch Informationen von Plattformen von Drittanbietern für verschiedene Geschäftszwecke wie das Management der Kreditinformationen des Unternehmens, das Programmmanagement oder technische Zwecke. Beispielsweise erhalten wir möglicherweise Kreditinformationen über ein Unternehmen, die die Namen von Personen enthalten. Wenn Sie an einem Open Source-Projekt oder unserem öffentlichen Bug Bounty-Programm teilnehmen, erhalten wir möglicherweise Details über Sie, wie z. B. Ihren Benutzernamen oder Pull-Anfragen, um Ihre Teilnahme an dem Projekt oder Programm zu verwalten und Ihnen Updates bereitzustellen.
Wenn Sie sich als Kandidat für eine Stelle bei Okta bewerben, erhalten wir im Rahmen der in Ihrer Region geltenden Gesetzgebung möglicherweise personenbezogene Daten über Sie von Dritten zu geschäftlichen Zwecken, z. B. durch Hintergrundüberprüfungen (Informationen zu Bildung, Beschäftigung, Kriminalgeschichte und Finanzen), öffentlich zugängliche Quellen (z. B. Social-Media-Konten, einschließlich LinkedIn zur Identifizierung von Kandidaten), Feedback zu Ihrer Bewerbung und aus Interviews sowie Daten von anderen Dritten, die möglicherweise Feedback zu Ihrer Bewerbung geben. Referenzen, die wir im Rahmen Ihres Bewerbungsverfahrens erhalten, werden von Okta vertraulich behandelt
Für unsere professionelle Dienstleistungsarbeit als Verarbeiter oder Dienstleister unserer Kunden kann Okta auch personenbezogene Daten über Sie erhalten, um seinen vertraglichen Verpflichtungen mit Dritten nachzukommen. Okta-Partner können Ihre Geschäftskontaktinformationen auch an Okta weitergeben, um Ihrem Unternehmen zu empfehlen, Okta-Kunde zu werden. Wenn Okta daran interessiert ist, mit Ihrem anstellenden oder beibehaltenen Unternehmen zusammenzuarbeiten, es zu erwerben, in es zu investieren oder mit ihm zusammenarbeitet, es erwirbt oder in es investiert, kann Okta über die (potenzielle oder abgeschlossene) Transaktion für seine Geschäftszwecke personenbezogene Daten über Sie erhalten.
Von uns gesammelte Gerätedaten, Nutzungsdaten, sonstige Daten, Diagnosedaten und Metadaten
Erläuterung der Gerätedaten, Nutzungsdaten, diagnostischen Daten und anderer verwendeter Metadaten und Technologien
Wie die meisten Websites, Anwendungen und Software-Lösungen im Internet erfasst Okta bestimmte personenbezogene Daten, wenn Sie auf unsere Websites, Anwendungen, Software-Lösungen und Produkte und Dienstleistungen zugreifen und diese nutzen, die den in Ihrem Land geltenden Gesetzen unterliegen. Diese Datenerfassung ermöglicht es uns, besser zu verstehen, wie Anwender unsere Websites, Anwendungen, Produkte und Dienstleistungen nutzen, und ermöglicht es uns, unsere Websites, Anwendungen, Software-Lösungen, Produkte und Dienstleistungen bereitzustellen, zu korrigieren und zu verbessern sowie Betrug, Sicherheitsvorfälle und andere betrügerische oder bösartige Verhaltensweisen zu erkennen, zu untersuchen und zu bekämpfen. Zu den von uns erfassten Daten können folgende gehören:
Gerätedaten.
Wir können bestimmte Informationen von und über Ihr Gerät erfassen, wie z. B. eindeutige Gerätekennungen, den Browsertyp, das auf Ihrem Gerät installierte Betriebssystem, bestimmte Gerätekonfigurationen und ähnliche Geräte- oder Versionsinformationen („Gerätedaten“). Wir nutzen diese Gerätedaten, um den Standort des Geräts zu identifizieren, um notwendige Informationen bereitzustellen, notwendige Einwilligungen einzuholen, den Zugang zu unseren Produkten und Dienstleistungen zu verhindern, wie es das geltende Recht vorschreibt, und um andere für Okta geltende Anforderungen zu erfüllen, um Betrug, Sicherheitsvorfälle und andere betrügerische oder bösartige Aktivitäten zu erkennen, zu untersuchen und zu bekämpfen, sowie um festzustellen, dass Nutzer eines bestimmten Gerätetyps unsere Websites anders nutzen als Nutzer eines anderen Gerätetyps. Dies ermöglicht es uns, Fehler zu beheben und die Leistung unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu analysieren, unsere Websites, Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verbessern, z. B. durch Optimierung der Bildschirmgröße von Okta-Mobilanwendungen, oder sicherzustellen, dass die Nutzer unserer Kunden eine hochwertigere User-Experience erhalten. Zu den von uns erfassten Gerätedaten können folgende gehören:
Standortdaten.
Wir können Informationen zu Ihrem Standort erfassen, wenn Sie unsere Websites, mobilen Anwendungen, Produkte und Dienstleistungen nutzen. Ihr Standort kann mit unterschiedlicher Genauigkeit anhand Ihrer IP-Adresse und Informationen über Dinge in der Nähe Ihres Geräts, wie z. B. Bluetooth-fähige Geräte, bestimmt werden. Welche Arten von Standortdaten wir erfassen und wie lange wir sie speichern, hängt zum Teil von Ihrem Gerät und Ihren Einstellungen ab. Wenn wir Ihre genauen geografischen Daten erfassen, tun wir dies nur mit Ihrer Zustimmung.
Kamera.
Wenn diese Funktion aktiviert ist, können Sie bei einigen unserer Dienste Services einrichten, indem Sie mit der Kamera Ihres Geräts einen QR-Code scannen. Ohne Erlaubnis können wir nicht auf Ihre Kamera zugreifen. Sie können unseren Zugriff auf Ihre Kamera jederzeit ändern, indem Sie unseren Zugriff auf Ihre Kamera im Einstellungsmenü Ihres Geräts deaktivieren.
Touch ID und Face ID.
Bei einigen unserer Produkte und Dienste können Sie sich mit Touch ID und Face ID für Apple-Geräte und Face Unlock und Fingerabdruck Unlock für Android-Geräte authentifizieren. Wenn Sie sich mit Touch ID, Face ID, Face Unlock oder Fingerprint Unlock authentifizieren, werden wir nur darüber informiert, ob die Authentifizierung erfolgreich war und können nicht auf Face ID, Touch ID, Face Unlock oder Fingerprint Unlock zugreifen. Sie können Touch ID, Face ID, Face Unlock und Fingerprint Unlock jederzeit über das Einstellungsmenü Ihres Geräts aktivieren oder deaktivieren.
Nutzungsdaten.
Wir können auch Daten über Ihre Nutzung unserer Websites, Anwendungen, Produkte und Dienstleistungen erfassen, einschließlich Daten über Dienstkonfigurationen und Anwendungen, die in Verbindung mit dem gehosteten Dienst genutzt werden, Supportdaten, Betriebsdaten, Protokolldaten, Protokolle Ihrer Nutzungs- und Klickaktivitäten, Protokolle über Ihren Anmeldeverlauf, Identitätsbestätigung und die Leistungsergebnisse für den gehosteten Dienst („Nutzungsdaten“). Okta verwendet Nutzungsdaten, um: (i) Nutzungstrends zu analysieren, (ii) Betrug und Cyberangriffe zu erkennen, zu untersuchen und zu bekämpfen, (iii) Sicherheitsvorfälle und andere betrügerische, betrügerische oder böswillige Aktivitäten gegenüber Okta oder seinen Kunden zu erkennen, zu untersuchen und zu bekämpfen, einschließlich der Ergreifung von Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des allgemeinen Security-Standings von Okta, (iv) die Service- und Produktfunktionalität zu verbessern und (v) einen anderen Dienstanbieter oder Auftragnehmer zu beauftragen und/oder zu beschäftigen.
Bug-, Fehler- und Absturzberichte.
Wir können auch Daten über Probleme sammeln, die Sie mit unseren Websites, Anwendungen, Produkten und Diensten haben, einschließlich Bug-, Fehler- und Absturzberichte, die Gerätedaten, Standortdaten, Nutzungsdaten und Benutzerdaten zum Zeitpunkt des Bugs, Fehlers und/oder Absturzes enthalten können.
Sonstige Daten.
Die erfassten Daten können nur für das Mobilgerätemanagementprodukt von Okta auch die auf Ihrem Gerät installierten Anwendungen enthalten. Zusammen bezeichnen wir diese Daten als „Zusatzdaten“. Einige der Zusatzdaten, darunter die Nutzungsdaten, die wir erhalten, hängen von den Richtlinien und Einstellungen Ihres Unternehmens ab und davon, wie sie mit Okta geteilt werden können. Okta verwendet Zusatzdaten, um die Sicherheit zu verbessern und seine Produkte für Kunden bereitzustellen und zu verbessern, einschließlich, um das Kundenverhalten besser zu verstehen, um neue Funktionen zu erstellen und bedrohungsbezogene Erkenntnisse für unsere Kunden bereitzustellen.
Einige dieser Produkte, die Zusatzdaten sammeln und verarbeiten, umfassen:
das Browser-Plugin von Okta;
die Desktop- und Mobilanwendungen (Okta Verify und Okta Mobile) von Okta; und
Verbraucherprodukte von Okta.
Durch das Browser-Plugin von Okta enthalten die von uns gesammelten Zusatzdaten Details zu Ihrer Anmeldesitzung, IP-Adresse, Benutzeragent, Name der Webanwendung und Website-Adresse sowie andere Informationen, die nicht persönlicher Natur sind. Darüber hinaus erfassen wir möglicherweise Interaktionsdaten über Ihre Verwendung des Browser-Plugins von Okta. Wir verwenden die über das Browser-Plugin von Okta gesammelten Informationen zu Sicherheitszwecken und zur Bereitstellung von Funktionen, z. B. indem wir es Ihnen ermöglichen, Ihre Passwörter für von Ihnen besuchte Websites besser zu verwalten.
Diagnosedaten.
Einige Produkte und Dienste erfordern möglicherweise die Installation von On-Premises-Software (z. B. Agents, Anwendungen zur Geräteverwaltung) oder können durch diese erweitert werden. Die On-Premises-Software kann Daten zur Nutzung und Performance der Software erfassen, einschließlich IP-Adresse, Benutzername und Host-Name, die von Okta übermittelt und verwendet werden können, um Kundensupport zu leisten, Probleme mit der On-Premises-Software und/oder damit verbundenen Produkten und Dienstleistungen zu diagnostizieren, unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verbessern und/oder für die in der/den geltenden Vereinbarung(en) zwischen Okta und dem jeweiligen Kunden genannten Zwecke. So bietet Okta Advanced Server Access („ASA“) Kunden die Möglichkeit, Support-Bundles zu erstellen, die lokale Protokolldateien enthalten. Diese werden von der auf den ASA-Servern des Kunden laufenden lokalen Software erzeugt. Der Kunde kann sie Okta zur Verfügung stellen, damit Okta Probleme diagnostizieren und Support erbringen kann.
Metadaten.
Wir können Metadaten über Sie sammeln, einschließlich technischer Daten über Ihre Leistung oder Nutzung unserer Website, Produkte und Dienstleistungen. Eine gängige Technologie zum Sammeln von Metadaten, die als personenbezogene Daten gelten können, ist die Verwendung von Cookies. Cookies sind kleine Textdateien, die in Ihrem Webbrowser abgelegt werden und die uns helfen, Ihren Browser oder Ihr Gerät je nach Art des Cookies auf unterschiedliche Weise als eindeutigen Besucher zu erkennen. Die drei Hauptarten von Cookies sind:
Erforderliche Cookies.
Für die Funktionalität und Sicherheit der Website erforderliche Cookies. Beispielsweise können Authentifizierungs-, Sicherheits- und Sitzungscookies erforderlich sein, damit unsere Website oder Produkte funktionieren.
Funktionale Cookies.
Wir verwenden funktionale Cookies, um die Leistung unserer Websites zu verbessern, für Marktforschungen oder andere Analysen oder Werbung, die nicht an eine bestimmte Person gebunden sind. Beispielsweise können wir Google Analytics verwenden, um zu verfolgen, wie viele Personen unsere Website besucht haben. Aus den in diesem Abschnitt beschriebenen Gründen können wir auch lokale HTML5-Speichercookies verwenden. Diese Arten von Cookies unterscheiden sich von Browser-Cookies in der Menge und Art der von ihnen gespeicherten Daten und in der Art und Weise, wie sie gespeichert werden.
Targeting- oder Werbe-Cookies.
Wir verwenden Targeting- und Werbe-Cookies, um unsere Marketing-Maßnahmen zu verstehen und potenzielle Kunden über das Internet zu erreichen. Beispielsweise schließen wir Verträge mit Werbenetzwerken von Drittanbietern ab, die Ihre Aktivitäten im Laufe der Zeit und über verschiedene Kanäle hinweg verfolgen können, einschließlich unserer Websites, E-Mail-Aktivitäten und anderer Websites und Anwendungen, auf denen Werbung geschaltet wird. Sie können diese Tracking-Informationen verwenden, um Ihre Interessen zu verstehen und vorherzusagen, um eine Werbung für Okta auf einer anderen Website anzuzeigen oder um Ihnen eine Marketing-Botschaft für ein Okta-Produkt per E-Mail zu senden.
Wenn Sie Ihre Cookies und Ihre Berechtigungen zum Teilen von Daten mit Cookie-Anbietern verwalten möchten, besuchen Sie bitte den folgenden Abschnitt unter
Ihre Informationsauswahl
.
Eine zweite gängige Technologie, mit der wir Metadaten erfassen, die als personenbezogene Daten betrachtet werden können, ist die Beacon-Technologie. Wir verwenden Beacons auf unseren Websites und in E-Mail-Mitteilungen an Sie. Beacons liefern uns Informationen über Ihre Aktivitäten und helfen uns, unsere Geschäftsabläufe und -strategien zu verbessern, z. B. indem wir die Funktionen unserer E-Mail-Mitteilungen verstehen und unsere Websites und Inhalte verbessern. Wenn Sie beispielsweise auf eine Marketing-E-Mail über ein neues Produkt oder eine neue Dienstleistung klicken, gibt das Beacon uns Signale, dass Sie und Ihr Unternehmen möglicherweise daran interessiert sind, mehr darüber zu erfahren. Wenn Sie Ihre E-Mail-Abonnements bei uns verwalten möchten, besuchen Sie bitte den folgenden Abschnitt unter
Ihre Informationsauswahl
.
IV. Wie wir personenbezogene Daten verwenden
Wie wir die von uns gesammelten personenbezogenen Daten verwenden, hängt zum Teil davon ab, auf welchem Weg Sie mit uns kommunizieren, wie Sie unsere Websites nutzen und mit uns interagieren und welche Präferenzen Sie uns mitgeteilt haben. Im Allgemeinen verwenden wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nach Bedarf, um unser Geschäft zu betreiben und unsere täglichen Aktivitäten auszuführen. Zusätzlich zu den an anderer Stelle in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie angegebenen Verwendungszwecken können wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verwenden, um die folgenden Aufgaben auszuführen (was wir auch in den 12 Monaten vor dem Datum des Inkrafttretens dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie getan haben):
Wir nutzen sie, um mit Ihnen über unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu kommunizieren und eine reibungslose Interaktion sicherzustellen.
Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten wie Kontaktdaten, Zusatzdaten und Metadaten verwenden, um Ihnen Transaktionsmitteilungen, Benachrichtigungen, Aktualisierungen, Sicherheitswarnungen und Verwaltungsnachrichten zu unseren Produkten und Dienstleistungen zu senden, die für Sie und Ihr Unternehmen nützlich sein können. Wir werden auf Ihre Fragen antworten, maßgeschneiderte Mitteilungen basierend auf Ihren Aktivitäten und Interaktionen mit uns bereitstellen und Ihnen helfen, unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen effektiv zu nutzen. Wir verwenden Administrator-Daten auch, um mit Ihnen zu verschiedenen Zwecken zu kommunizieren, z. B. um Sie über Aktualisierungen Ihres Kontos zu informieren (über Ihr Abonnement, Einstellungen, Sicherheit, Rechnungsstellung, Funktions- und Produktaktualisierungen, technische Probleme, Zertifizierungen und ähnliche Inhalte). Sie können sich nicht von nicht werblichen und transaktionsbezogenen Mitteilungen abmelden. Um Werbemitteilungen zu verwalten, managen Sie Ihre Kommunikationspräferenzen über Ihre Administrator-Einstellungen, die Okta-Communities oder unser Abonnement-Center (im Abschnitt „Ihre Informationsauswahl“ unten verlinkt).
In bestimmten Situationen können wir Administrator-Daten an autorisierte Partner weitergeben, um Ihnen Informationen zu liefern, die für Ihren Kauf von Okta oder von Tools anderer Unternehmen, die sich mit Okta verbinden können, relevant sind, um Ihre technischen oder organisatorischen Anforderungen zu erfüllen.
Wenn Sie sich entscheiden, die Benachrichtigungen zu aktivieren, werden wir auch Ihre Administrator-Daten verwenden, um Ihnen Benachrichtigungen zum Trust-Status zu übermitteln, auch per SMS („Okta Alerts“). Telefonnummern, die wir im Rahmen der Okta Alerts-SMS-Abonnements erfassen, werden nicht zu Marketingzwecken verwendet und nur an Dienstleister weitergegeben, wenn dies für die Abwicklung der Alerts erforderlich oder nach geltendem Recht verpflichtend ist. In einigen Fällen kann die Telefonnummer, die Sie für die Anmeldung bei Okta Alerts verwenden, dieselbe Telefonnummer sein, die wir zu Marketingzwecken verwenden, wenn Sie dem zugestimmt haben oder die Sie über einen anderen Kanal erhalten haben.
Wir nutzen Sie, um Datensicherheit und Datenschutz zu gewährleisten und einen effizienten Betrieb sicherzustellen.
Wir verwenden personenbezogene Daten wie Kontaktdaten, Zusatzdaten und andere Metadaten über Sie und Ihre Nutzung unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen, um Konten und Aktivitäten zu überprüfen, verdächtige oder betrügerische Aktivitäten zu überwachen und unsere Kunden bei der Überwachung verdächtiger oder betrügerischer Aktivitäten zu unterstützen und Verstöße gegen Richtlinien bezüglich der Nutzung unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu identifizieren. Wir können auch zusätzliche Daten mit anderen Daten kombinieren, die wir aus Sicherheitsgründen und zum Management unserer Business-Prozesse erhalten. Wir verarbeiten personenbezogene Daten, wie Kontakt- und Gesundheitsdaten, auch aus Gründen der Sicherheit und des Betriebsmanagements, z. B. um Besucher in unseren Büros zu registrieren und damit einhergehende Security-Maßnahmen umzusetzen (u. a. durch Nutzung unserer Atmosphere-Anwendung), einschließlich der Verwaltung von Non-Disclosure-Agreements, die Besucher möglicherweise unterzeichnen müssen. Wir verwenden Administrator-Daten darüber hinaus, um unseren Kunden den Okta-Dienst zur Verfügung zu stellen, Transaktionen abzuschließen, Support und andere Dienstleistungen für das Kundenkonto zu erbringen, Betrugsversuche aufzudecken und zu verhindern, zu Audit- und Compliance-Zwecken sowie zur Sicherstellung der Einhaltung geltender Gesetze. Die Räumlichkeiten von Okta werden physisch und elektronisch mit Software zur Zutrittskontrolle und geeigneten Tools überwacht und sind On-Premises durch Überwachungskameras geschützt, um unbefugte Zutritte zu unseren Büros zu verhindern und Mitarbeiter, autorisierte Besucher und unser Eigentum zu schützen.

Diese Mitteilungen zielen darauf ab, das Engagement zu fördern und den Nutzen zu maximieren, den Sie und Ihr Unternehmen aus den Produkten und Dienstleistungen von Okta ziehen können, einschließlich Informationen zu neuen Produkten und Funktionen, Umfrageanfragen, Newslettern und Veranstaltungen, von denen wir glauben, dass sie für Sie und Ihr Unternehmen von Interesse sind.
Wir nutzen sie für Analysen, Vorhersagen und Optimierungen von Ergebnissen und Betriebsabläufen.
Wir verwenden personenbezogene Daten zur Analyse und Vorhersage von Ergebnissen (z. B. aus unseren Vertriebs- und Marketinginitiativen sowie aus der Produktnutzung), zur Verbesserung der Leistung unserer Websites, Produkte und Dienstleistungen und des Kundensupports, zur Identifizierung potenzieller Kunden, Business-Chancen und potenzieller neuer Produktbereiche, zur Ermittlung von Trends, zur Verbesserung der Funktionalität unserer Websites, zur Verbesserung unserer Sicherheit und zur Bereitstellung allgemeiner Geschäftsinformationen, u. a. durch den Einsatz automatisierter Werkzeuge wie Machine-Learning-Technologien. Abhängig von den in Ihrem Land geltenden Gesetzen können wir die auf unseren Websites erfassten Metadaten und Nutzungsinformationen auch mit anderen Informationen kombinieren, um die oben geschilderten Zwecke zu unterstützen.
Wir nutzen sie für das Management von Wettbewerben, Promotions und Kundenbindungsprogrammen.
Okta kann gelegentlich Wettbewerbe oder andere Promotions durchführen, oder Sonderaktionen und Kundenbindungsprogramme für Kunden bereitstellen. Wenn Sie sich für eine solche Aktivität registrieren, verarbeiten wir möglicherweise Ihre personenbezogenen Daten wie Kontaktinformationen, biografische Informationen und vertragsbezogene Daten, um unseren Vertrag mit Ihnen auszuführen. Okta kann die bei diesen Wettbewerben, Werbeaktionen und Kundenbindungsprogrammen gesammelten personenbezogenen Daten, wie z. B. Kontaktdaten, auch verwenden, um Ihnen Werbematerial über Okta oder unsere Partner zu senden.
Wir nutzen sie, um Zahlungen zu verarbeiten.
Wir verarbeiten personenbezogene Daten wie Kontaktinformationen, vertragsbezogene Daten, Finanzinformationen, biografische Informationen und Zahlungsinformationen, um Zahlungen in dem Umfang zu verarbeiten, in dem dies erforderlich ist, um eine Transaktion abzuschließen und unseren Vertrag mit Ihnen oder Ihrem Unternehmen auszuführen.
Wir nutzen sie für die Rekrutierung von Mitarbeitern.
Wir verarbeiten Ihre personenbezogenen Daten wie Kontakt-, Bewerber- und biografische Daten, um Ihre Bewerbung zu bewerten und das Rekrutierungssystem sowie unsere Bewerbungsverfolgungs- und Rekrutierungsaktivitäten zu bewerten und zu verbessern. Wir verwenden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auch, um mit Ihnen über Ihre Bewerbung oder über offene Stellen bei Okta zu kommunizieren, die sich im Laufe der Zeit ergeben und von denen wir glauben, dass sie für Sie von Interesse sein könnten. Wir verwenden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auch, um Ihnen neue Informationen zu Einstellungsverfahren und Mitarbeitererfahrungen zu senden. Wir können Ihre Informationen überprüfen, unter anderem durch vertrauliche Referenzprüfungen und, sofern zulässig, Hintergrundprüfungen.
Wir nutzen sie für andere berechtigte Interessen.
Wo dies gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist oder wo wir glauben, dass es notwendig ist, um unsere gesetzlichen Rechte, Interessen oder Interessen anderer zu schützen, können wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten im Zusammenhang mit dem Management unseres Unternehmens verwenden – einschließlich, aber nicht ausschließlich der Betriebsabläufe, der Automatisierung von Workflows, der Business Intelligence (etwa mit Blick auf die Nutzung von Abonnements oder die Verwendung kostenloser Testversionen), der Verbesserung von Webseiten und Produkten, Rechtsansprüchen, Compliance-, Regulierungs- und Prüfungsfunktionen, um Missbrauch unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu verhindern und zum Schutz von persönlichem Eigentum oder der Sicherheit. So können wir beispielsweise die Einhaltung der geltenden Nutzungsbedingungen in unseren Kundenverträgen überprüfen, den Kapazitätsbedarf für unsere Produkte, Websites und Niederlassungen ermitteln, Ihre Benutzerfreundlichkeit verbessern, auf Ihre Support- oder Kontaktanfragen reagieren oder neue Business-Chancen identifizieren. Wenn Sie sich für die Teilnahme an bestimmten Programmen anmelden, wie z. B. für das Okta Ideas-Forum oder andere Produkt-Feedback-Programme, können wir zusätzliche Daten, einschließlich Nutzungsdaten, die im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Nutzung unserer Produkte und Dienste stehen, zusammen mit den Daten, die Sie uns über Okta Ideas zur Verfügung stellen, analysieren, um Ihnen eine bessere Kunden-Experience zu bieten. Darüber hinaus nutzen wir Administrator-Daten, um technischen Support zu leisten, wie in unserer Dokumentation und unserem Help Center beschrieben, und um unsere Produkte, Dienstleistungen und Prozesse im Zusammenhang mit der Bereitstellung dieses Supports zu verbessern.
Wir nutzen sie für weitere Zwecke, sofern Sie diesen zustimmen.
Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verwenden, wenn Sie uns zu einem bestimmten, nicht oben aufgeführten Zweck zugestimmt haben. Beispielsweise können wir mit Ihrer Erlaubnis Zeugnisse oder Kundengeschichten veröffentlichen, um für unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu werben, oder Anrufe zum Zweck der Qualitätssicherung aufzeichnen.
Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für einen anderen als den oben genannten Zweck verarbeiten, können wir Sie darüber in Kenntnis setzen und Ihre Zustimmung vor einer solchen Verarbeitung einholen, sofern dies nach den in Ihrem Land geltenden Gesetzen erforderlich ist.
Rechtsgrundlagen für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten (für Personen aus dem Vereinten Königreich, dem Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum und anderen relevanten Gerichtsbarkeiten).
Wenn Sie eine Person aus dem Vereinten Königreich, dem Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum (EWR) oder einer anderen relevanten Gerichtsbarkeit sind, sammeln und verarbeiten wir Informationen über Sie nur dann, wenn wir eine Rechtsgrundlage oder -grundlagen dafür nach geltendem Recht haben. Die Rechtsgrundlagen hängen von den Produkten und Dienstleistungen ab, die Ihr Unternehmen bei Okta gekauft hat, oder von den Okta-Consumer-Produkten, die Sie im Einsatz haben, ab, abhängig davon, was zutrifft, sowie davon, wie diese Produkte und Dienstleistungen verwendet werden und wie Sie mit der Website, den Systemen von Okta interagieren und kommunizieren und ob Sie an Okta-Veranstaltungen teilnehmen. Dies bedeutet, dass wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur in folgenden Fällen erfassen und verwenden:
Wir benötigen sie, um unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu betreiben und Ihnen unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen sowie Kundensupport und personalisierte Funktionen bereitzustellen und die Sicherheit unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu schützen;
Es erfüllt ein berechtigtes Interesse von Okta (das nicht durch Ihre Datenschutzinteressen außer Kraft gesetzt wird), beispielsweise für Forschung und Entwicklung, um Ihnen Informationen über unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen bereitzustellen, von denen wir glauben, dass sie für Sie und Ihr Unternehmen nützlich sein könnten, und um unsere gesetzlichen Rechte und Interessen zu schützen;
Sie erteilen uns die Zustimmung, dies für einen bestimmten Zweck zu tun; oder
Wir müssen einer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung nachkommen.
Wenn Sie unserer Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten für einen bestimmten Zweck zugestimmt haben, haben Sie das Recht, Ihre Meinung jederzeit zu ändern, vorbehaltlich vertraglicher und gesetzlicher Einschränkungen und einer vorherigen schriftlichen Mitteilung mit angemessenem Vorlauf. Dies hat keinen Einfluss auf die bereits erfolgte Verarbeitung. Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verwenden, weil wir oder Dritte (z. B. Ihr Arbeitgeber) ein berechtigtes Interesse daran haben, haben Sie das Recht, dieser Verwendung zu widersprechen. In einigen Fällen kann dies jedoch dazu führen, dass Sie unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen nicht mehr nutzen.
Wenn wir personenbezogene Daten für die weitere Verwendung de-identifizieren, verpflichten wir uns, die Informationen in de-identifizierter Form aufzubewahren und zu verwenden. Wir werden nicht versuchen, die Informationen erneut zu identifizieren – es sei denn, um festzustellen, ob unsere Prozesse zur De-Identifizierung geltenden gesetzlichen Anforderungen entsprechen.

Social-Media-Kanäle von Okta
Websites von Okta verwenden möglicherweise Social-Media-Funktionen, z. B. die Facebook-Schaltfläche „Gefällt mir“, die Schaltfläche „Herz“ von Instagram, die Sharing-Features von Twitter und andere vergleichbare Widgets („Social-Media-Funktionen“). Diese Social-Media-Funktionen bieten Ihnen möglicherweise die Möglichkeit, Informationen zu Ihren Aktivitäten auf einer Website auf einer Profilseite zu veröffentlichen, die von einem Social-Media-Netzwerk eines Drittanbieters bereitgestellt wird, um Inhalte mit anderen in Ihrem Netzwerk zu teilen. Social-Media-Funktionen werden entweder vom jeweiligen Social-Media-Netzwerk oder direkt auf unseren Websites gehostet. Sofern die Social-Media-Funktionen von den jeweiligen Social-Media-Netzwerken gehostet werden und Sie von unserer Website aus auf diese klicken, erhalten diese möglicherweise Informationen darüber, dass Sie unsere Website besucht haben. Wenn Sie in Ihrem Social-Media-Konto angemeldet sind, kann das jeweilige Social-Media-Netzwerk Ihren Besuch auf unseren Websites möglicherweise mit Ihrem Social-Media-Profil verknüpfen.
Ihre Interaktionen mit Social Media-Funktionen unterliegen den Datenschutzrichtlinien (und anderen anwendbaren Bestimmungen) der jeweiligen Unternehmen, die die relevanten Social-Media-Funktionen bereitstellen.
Über andere Kanäle verfügbare Produkte und Services

VI. Oktas Sicherheitslage und ergriffene Maßnahmen
Sicherheit ist für Okta von entscheidender Bedeutung. Wir unterhalten ein umfassendes schriftliches Informationssicherheitsprogramm, das administrative, technische und physische Schutzmaßnahmen nach Industriestandard enthält, um personenbezogene Daten vor Verlust, Diebstahl oder dem unbefugten Zugriff, der missbräuchlichn Nutzung, der Offenlegung und der Manipulation zu schützen.
Kein Sicherheitssystem ist jedoch perfekt, und aufgrund der Natur des Internets können wir nicht garantieren, dass Daten, einschließlich personenbezogener Daten, absolut sicher vor dem Eindringen oder anderen unbefugten Zugriffen anderer sind. Sie sind dafür verantwortlich, Ihre Passwörter und anderen Authentisierungsfaktoren zu schützen und die Sicherheit Ihrer Geräte zu gewährleisten.
Wenn Sie den Online-Dienst von Okta über ein Abonnement nutzen, das ein Okta-Kunde für Sie gekauft hat, ist dieser Kunde für die entsprechende Konfiguration Ihrer Instanz verantwortlich. Weitere Informationen zu Sicherheitseinstellungen und -konfigurationen finden Sie in der Dokumentation zu unserem Onlinedienst, einschließlich der „Trust & Compliance“-Dokumentation, die verfügbar ist unter

Ihre personenbezogenen Daten werden möglicherweise außerhalb Ihrer Gerichtsbarkeit und in Ländern verarbeitet, die keiner Angemessenheitsentscheidung der Europäischen Kommission oder Ihres örtlichen Gesetzgebers und/oder Ihrer Aufsichtsbehörde unterliegen und möglicherweise nicht das gleiche Datenschutzniveau wie Ihre Gerichtsbarkeit bieten, wie beispielsweise der Europäische Wirtschaftsraum, Großbritannien oder Japan. Zum Beispiel gibt es in den Vereinigten Staaten zum Zeitpunkt des Inkrafttretens dieser Richtlinie kein Bundesgesetz zum Schutz der Privatsphäre, das alle Arten von Daten abdeckt; der Schutz der Privatsphäre wird jedoch durch Bundes- und Landesbehörden sowie durch verschiedene Landesgesetze geregelt. In Anbetracht der regionalen Unterschiede hat Okta verschiedene Schutzmaßnahmen und die oben beschriebenen Sicherheitsvorkehrungen ergriffen. Wenn wir beispielsweise personenbezogene Daten weitergeben, ergreifen wir angemessene Maßnahmen, damit der Empfänger Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten ein angemessenes Datenschutzniveau bietet, beispielsweise durch den Abschluss entsprechender Vereinbarungen, die einschlägige Datenschutzbestimmungen enthalten, oder wir werden Sie um Ihre vorherige Zustimmung zu solchen internationalen Datenübermittlungen bitten.

We will never sell your personal data to anyone.

: Once your data is exported to Looker Studio, it will be governed by the applicable
Looker Studio terms of service and policies
provided by Google. We strongly advise you to review their terms and policies and understand the implications before initiating the data transfer.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google
to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data

Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:
Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like
Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.
Legal bases of processing
We process your information for the
purposes
described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
We process your data in order to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract.
We process your data for our legitimate interests and those of
third parties
while applying
appropriate safeguards
that protect your privacy.
We process your data when necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person.
We process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so.
We ask for your consent to process your data for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
How you use Google services and your privacy settings will determine what data is processed, the purposes for which this data is processed, and the legal bases for processing data. The table below explains these processing purposes, the kinds of data processed, and the legal grounds for processing this data, in more detail.
Why and how we process data
What data is processed
Legal grounds
To provide Google services, products, and features
Examples of processing activities:
We process the terms you search for in order to return results.
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video.
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account.
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, we use your shipping address or delivery instructions for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
We process your payment information when you buy extra storage for Google Drive.
We can use contact info (like names and email addresses) of people you interact with in Google products to make it easier to find who you’re looking for when you want to share and communicate with these people in other Google services like Gmail, Photos and Assistant.
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail.
Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
We can help you share your location using
Google Location Sharing
, so that others can find you on a map, or know your estimated time of arrival.
As described in the
Sharing your information
section, we’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent, and provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account.
The information processed will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
Things you create or provide to us
:
Content you create, upload, or receive (like photos, videos, emails, docs and spreadsheets).
Google Dashboard
allows you to manage information associated with specific products.
Personal information that you provide us when you create a Google Account (like your
name
and password,
phone number
, date of birth, or
payment information
).
Information that we collect as you use our services
:
Information about your apps, browsers & devices
, such as
unique identifiers

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.

This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services

data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

We do not knowingly sell or share any personal data of minors under the age of 16. We do not collect or process “sensitive personal information,” as defined by California law, to infer characteristics about you. Zendesk only uses sensitive personal information consistent with the exceptions to the right to limit sensitive personal information.
Financial Incentives
: We may offer a benefit or offering in exchange for you providing personal data, such as a discount or coupon to individuals who respond to a survey. As part of these surveys we may collect personal data, such as your name, contact information, preferences, experiences, beliefs, opinions, and other responses to the survey questions. Participation in surveys is governed by the applicable terms and conditions for the survey, which will describe any financial incentives associated with that survey and how to participate. The value of your data is the value of the offer presented to you. We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit. You may withdraw from any financial incentive at any time by emailing us at
privacy@zendesk.com
. If we offer another type of financial incentive, we will share with you the material terms of each offer when we ask you to participate.
b. Your Data Protection Rights:
Subject to legal limitations, certain California residents may have the below rights.
Right to Know.
You have the right to request information about the categories of personal data we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the personal data, the purposes for collecting the personal data, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your personal data, and the purpose for which we disclosed your personal data (“
Categories Report
”). You may also request information about the specific pieces of personal data we have collected about you (“
Specific Pieces Report
”).
Right to Delete.
You have the right to request that we delete personal data that we have collected from you.
Right to Correct.
You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data that we maintain about you.
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.
We do not sell personal data to third parties in exchange for money. However, as we explain in
Section 5
, we share information with advertising partners and allow advertising partners to collect information from our Digital Properties. This exchange may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under California law, and you have the right to opt out of this “sale” or “sharing” of personal data.
California residents may request to exercise the Right to Know, the Right to Delete, and the Right to Correct by using our
webform
. We will not discriminate against you, in any manner prohibited by applicable law, for exercising these rights.
How to Fully Exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing:
In order to fully exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing with respect to any “sale” or “sharing” of information, you must undertake both of the following steps:
Submit a Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request using our
webform
; and
Disable the use of advertising cookies and other tracking technologies by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in our website footer. You must complete this step on each of our Sites from each browser and on each device that you use. These steps are necessary so that we can place a first-party cookie signaling that you have opted out on each browser and each device you use.
If you block cookies, we will be unable to comply with your Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request for device data that we automatically collect and disclose to third parties online using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies. If you clear the cookies in your browser, you will need to follow Step 2 above again. To the extent required by California law, we will honor “Do Not Sell or Share” opt-out preference signals sent in a format commonly-used and recognized by businesses at the browser level, such as an HTTP header field or JavaScript object.
Verification:
To process California data protection requests, we will need to obtain information to locate you in our records or verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request. In most cases, we will request information about you, which may include your name, email address, or other information. If you submit a Right to Know “Specific Pieces Report,” we may also request a signed declaration, under penalty of perjury, that you are who you say you are. We may request alternative information under certain circumstances and/or use third parties to help verify your identity.
Authorized Agents:
Authorized agents may exercise California data protection rights on behalf of California individuals, but we reserve the right to verify the individual’s identity directly as described above. Authorized agents must contact us by submitting a request through our
webform
and indicate that they are submitting the request as an agent. We may require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on your behalf by providing signed permission from you. We may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
Timing:
We will process Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing requests within fifteen business days from the date we received the request. We will respond to Requests to Delete and Requests to Know within forty-five days unless we need more time, in which case we will notify you, and it may take up to ninety days to respond to your request.

We only use contact information to respond to an inquiry on behalf of a Customer if you, as a Respondent, contact us.
(b) Cookies.
We use required cookies to ensure the operation of a Creator’s survey, form, application, or other SurveyMonkey product. These cookies are used to ensure that all aspects of the survey operate appropriately and optimally. For more information please read our
Cookies section below
and our
Respondent Cookies Notice
.
Examples: We use page tags to allow the email sender (for a survey or form for example) to measure the performance of email messaging and to learn how to improve email deliverability and open rates. We also use cookies to ensure a respondent can only take a survey once (where the Creator has set this function) and to track completion rates of surveys.
After completion of a survey, in most cases, you will be redirected to our website and treated as a website visitor where other cookies may be used so you should read our Website Visitor section if this is of interest to you.
(c) Device and browser data.
We use device data both to troubleshoot problems with our service and to make improvements to it.
We use your device and browser data to provide our services to the Creator. For example: your IP address is used to ensure that you do not complete the same survey, form, application or questionnaire twice if the creator has included settings to avoid this (ballot stuffing).
(d) Inferred geographic location.
We also may infer your geographic location based on your IP address. This allows Creators to filter responses by inferred geographic location. Note: we do not collect precise (GPS) location.
(e) Event data.

To create and improve services, features, content or make recommendations;
To track behavior at the aggregate/de-identified level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services; and

(f) Third parties and integration data.
We will collect and use information from third parties and integration partners to facilitate Creators in sending surveys/forms/applications/questionnaires to you.
(g) Survey response data.
SurveyMonkey may use first party machine learning or third party artificial intelligence tools on data around the type of survey the Creator has sent you, the question type, survey responses (at an aggregated and de-identified/pseudonymized level only), and device and event data associated with responses to  fulfill our contract with Creators and provide Creators with useful and relevant insights from the data they have collected using our services. Specifically, we use machine learning on survey data to help Creators by:
identifying trends in their responses;
ongoing training of models to optimize responses;
making product recommendations and providing guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios (For an example of this check out how SurveyMonkey Genius works here);
Extracting and analyzing usage patterns, for example, we might identify when respondents prefer multiple choice versus open text questions and make predictive response suggestions when certain question types are selected. We might also use this data to help improve analysis of responses;
undertaking personalization for survey Creators;
improving user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers or by altering questions to match the responses being provided by a Respondent); and
identify insightful data trends (which do not disclose Personal Data) and make recommendations to Creators based on those trends.
A Creator has some controls over how we use responses and may have opted-out of applying machine learning to responses where it is
linked to a specific product feature
in some cases.

9.1
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles.
SurveyMonkey Inc. has self-certified its compliance under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles. SurveyMonkey Inc. is committed to subjecting all personal information received from the European Union (EU) member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the Framework’s applicable Principles. SurveyMonkey Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. SurveyMonkey Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.

To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework Program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
SurveyMonkey Inc. also complies with the onward transfer liability provisions of the DPF.
When SurveyMonkey Inc. receives personal information under the DPF and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as agent on SurveyMonkey Inc.'s behalf, SurveyMonkey Inc. has certain liability under the DPF if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF and (ii) SurveyMonkey Inc. is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In certain situations, SurveyMonkey Inc. may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the DPF, SurveyMonkey Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
10. Who is my data controller?
If you have provided survey responses, filled out a form, submitted an application, or provided website feedback to a Creator using SurveyMonkey services, that Creator is the controller of your data, and SurveyMonkey is the processor of that data.
For SurveyMonkey Enterprise account holders, your organization’s primary administrator controls some basic account level information which you input when setting up your account like name, email address, and profile photo.
If you have provided survey responses, filled out a form, submitted an application, or provided website feedback directly to SurveyMonkey, then SurveyMonkey is the controller and our use of that data is described by this Notice and in our
SurveyMonkey Research Privacy Notice
.
If you are a Creator and have received more responses than your plan allows (“overage data”), SurveyMonkey is the controller over the overage data until you change your plan type, or the overage data is deleted in accordance with section 12.4 of our
Terms of Use
or per the terms of your negotiated contract.
SurveyMonkey is a controller for the account-level data provided by its Creators and panelists from Contribute and Rewards. More information can be found in section 13.6 of this Privacy Notice.
11. Your rights
You may wish to exercise a right to obtain information about yourself or to correct, update or delete that information. For more information about these rights you can read about it
here
. Some of these rights may be subject to some exceptions or limitations in local law. Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon your location. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and we will respond to your request to exercise these rights within a reasonable time (and in all cases within 30 days of receiving a request) subject to the below for specific categories of person.
11.1
Apply Applicants
For SurveyMonkey Apply users please see
information on how to exercise your rights here
.
11. 2 Creator
Where you hold an account with any SurveyMonkey service, you are entitled to a copy of all Personal Data which we hold in relation to you. You also may be entitled to request that we restrict how we use your data or object to some aspect of our treatment of your data. You can access a lot of your data in your own account when you log in. If you want to exercise your rights, please contact us
here
.
Depending on your plan type, SurveyMonkey also enables you to export your own response data from our system in a variety of formats so that you can back it up or use it with other applications. Alternatively, for assistance in exporting or deleting responses, you can contact us.
11.3 Respondent
Where you have responded to a survey, form, questionnaire or application sent to you by a Creator using a SurveyMonkey service, you will need to reach out directly to that individual or organization to discuss managing, deleting, accessing, restricting access to or otherwise withdrawing consent for use of the information which you provided to them in your responses. SurveyMonkey does not control your response data and, accordingly, is not in a position to directly handle these requests in relation to that data. If you are having difficulties finding this Creator or if you have any other questions after reading this Privacy Notice, you can
contact us
through
our support team
and we will try our best to help you.

11.6 Authorized Agent
If you are a third party organization acting on behalf of a data subject (or class of data subjects) to exercise data subject rights, we do work with you. In this case:
We ask you to follow our process outlined in this Privacy Notice for security reasons so that we can independently verify the Creator (if it is a Creator) making any requests to exercise their rights.
Where applicable, we directly interact with a Creator’s registered email address, because we authenticate users with username and unique password and not with other identifying information (e.g., photo ID or similar).
Please do not share other forms of personal identification for data subjects with us when submitting requests.
11.7

TechValidate
Our main Privacy Notice applies to our TechValidate users except where the Privacy Notice specifies a section that is only applicable to our survey tool.
13.1.1
TechFacts
TechFacts are published on an anonymous basis – that is, no Respondent Personal Information is displayed in a TechFact unless your Respondents authorize the use of their name and company affiliation. You are able to see the individual respondent’s identity in your account and, if you give a SurveyMonkey employee permission to view that response, then SurveyMonkey will also see this. However, we never publish or disseminate this information (unless you explicitly ask us to do so).
We assign a unique identification number to each TechFact. The ID will appear on each copy of the TechFact. Our site is designed so that visitors may look up and view TechFacts without the collection of any personal information (except for such visitor's internet protocol (IP) address).
13.2
SurveyMonkey Apply
SurveyMonkey Apply is an online application system that helps organizations collect applications, manage subscriptions and facilitate reviews. Our main Privacy Notice applies to
apply.surveymonkey.com
(“SurveyMonkey Apply”) except where the Privacy Notice specifies a section that is applicable only to our survey tool. Responses and Respondents in this section are intended as reference to applicants and their applications for the purposes of use of SurveyMonkey Apply.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring
:

configure Analytics data collection
.
Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data

Please note that any capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined below have the meanings assigned to them in the
Terms of Service
or any applicable  Master Service Agreement (MSA) which we have entered into with you.
Summary
We only collect and process information with your consent, or on another legal basis; we only require the minimum amount of personal data that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties, and we only use it as this Privacy Policy describes.
If you're visiting us from the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK), please see our global privacy practices: we are compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") and, in certain cases, with the certain local data protection laws (e.g., the “Federal Data Protection Act” in Germany, or the California Online Privacy Protection Act in the USA).
If you are visiting us from California, the USA, please note that you may have specific rights under the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, and certain other privacy and data protection laws.
No matter where you are, where you live, or what your citizenship is, we provide a high standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location.
Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!
1. What information do we collect
A. Personal Data Subjects.
We may collect information from visitors to and/or users of our Platform (collectively, “Users” or “you”). This includes:
- visitors of our Website who have not (yet) signed up to our Platform or Services;
- natural persons who are our Customers (as defined in the Terms of Service or MSA), and
- Authorized Users - individuals who are registered or permitted by one of our Customers to access a Team’s Workspace (as defined in the Terms of Service or MSA) and/or use the Services. Authorized Users may include, for example, in-house localization managers, CTOs, CPOs, or external/outsourced translators working on a translation project in the Team’s Workspace.
B. Types of Information.
Information about you can be divided in two groups:
“Personally identifiable information” or personal data that can be used to identify or contact you (the “Personal Data” or “PII”). See Subsection C below.
“Aggregated Information” - information or data we collect that are anonymous or where all identifiable information have been removed. See Subsection D below.
Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Personal Data or Aggregated Information (collectively “User Data”). Certain User Data has been collected automatically and, if some User Data such as the names and emails of the Authorized Users is not provided, we will be unable to provide the Services.
C. Personal Data.
Personal Data is any piece of information that can potentially be used to identify, contact, or locate a user uniquely. We need this information so we can interact with each other and so that we can provide our Services in a high-quality way that is specific to your needs. You provide your Personal Data, for example, by signing up on our Platform or paying for the Services or visiting our Website.
For example, when you visit our Website, our systems automatically maintain web logs to record technical data about all visitors of our Website and store this information in our databases. These weblogs may contain information about you including the following: IP address, type(s) of operating system you use, type of device you use, date and time you visited our Website, your activity and/or referring websites and the pages most frequently accessed.
Personal Data collected by us is protected as personal data under applicable data protection laws, for example, under the GDPR.
You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all Personal Data that you submit to us. Inaccurate Personal Data may affect your experience when using the Services and/or our ability to contact you as described in this Policy.
We may transfer your Personal Data without de-identification or anonymization to our partners and service providers if it’s needed to improve our Services and Platform in case you have consented to this.
D. Aggregated Information.
Aggregated Information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous Information about users of the Platform. Aggregated Information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by the information compiled.
We may de-identify or anonymize your Personal Data so that you cannot be individually identified by this data anymore. For example, we may de-identify your weblog data by removing all device identifiers (such as the identifying parts of your IP address). We may provide that de-identified information to our partners, vendors and/or affiliates. We also may combine your de-identified information with that of other users to create aggregate de-identified data that may be disclosed to third parties who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services so that they can provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, we may use the information gathered to create a composite profile of all the users of the Platform to understand users’ needs in order to design appropriate features and tools.
2. How do we collect your Personal Data
The Information that you provide directly to us will be apparent from the context in which you provide the data. In particular, we collect the following User Data:
A. Contact Information.
When you create or update your Team’s Workspace we collect your full name, email address, phone number, company's name, role in your team and account login credentials (audit logs).
When you fill in our online form to contact our sales team (e.g., schedule a call), we collect your full name, email, country, your guests' emails, phone number and anything else you tell us about your project, needs and timeline.
When you respond to Lokalise emails, newsletters or surveys, we collect your email address, name and any other information you choose to include in the body of your email or responses.
B. Billing Details.
When you subscribe to a paid plan version of the Services, our payment processor or bank collects your billing details. Different payment methods may require the collection of different types of information, such as your payment card number, CVC, expiration date and/or bank account number and/or a billing address.
Please note that payment information submitted by you will be processed by our payment processor or bank. We do not intentionally receive or process your billing information. However, we have access to some of our Customers’ billing details via our account with the payment processor or bank. Please review our
Data Processing Addendum
for details.
C. Information we collect automatically
. Even if you do not provide information to us, we automatically collect technical data such as web logs about your use of and interaction with our Platform and/or Website as described in Section 1 above. We use the technical data to troubleshoot problems, gather information for analysis of the Platform and/or Website usage, customize your experience when accessing our Platform, Services and for other business purposes.
D. Data from Third-Party Services
. Our Customers can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services needed for better collaboration in their Team’s Workspace. Typically, Third-Party Services refer to software that integrates into our Platform (e.g., Jira, Asana, GitHub) and the Customer can enable and disable these integrations. For more information on Third-Party Services (available integrations, plugins and libraries),
click here
.
Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with Lokalise and vice versa. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit the import of files to your Team’s Workspace, we may receive a user's name and email address, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Lokalise to facilitate the integration.
Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Lokalise. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Platform.
E. Third-Party Data.
We may receive Information about you from outside sources, such as commercially available demographic or marketing information, and add or combine it with your information to provide better service to you and inform you of Services or other information that may be of interest to you. This data may be combined with the User Data we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to which zip codes or countries, or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.
We also offer you the functionality of using your social media credentials (e.g., Google, GitHub, Microsoft) and corporate identity management tools (e.g., Okta) for single sign-on to enter our Platform, and in that manner, we may also collect certain information from you as you log on. We will not collect more information from you when using your social media credentials beyond the information that third parties disclose to us.
F. Additional Information.
We receive your Personal Data when you submit it to our Platform, if you participate in an offer, program or promotion, focus group, contest, webinar, activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts, sign up for email updates, give us your business card or contact details at conferences or other events, provide feedback or otherwise communicate with our team.
3. What is our legal basis for processing information
Under specific laws (including the GDPR), we are required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process your Personal Data. We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have a lawful basis. Lawful basis includes:
Consent, where you have given explicit consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR);
Contract, where processing is necessary to take steps to enter into, perform or terminate a contract with you (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR);
Compliance with a legal obligation, e.g. where we need your data for compliance with specific laws (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR);
Vital or public interest, where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest of a data subject or another person (Art. 6 (1) (d) and (e) GDPR);
“Legitimate interests”, except where such interests are overridden by the interests, rights or freedoms of a data subject (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). For example, we have a legitimate interest in operating, securing, and delivering our Platform to you or providing customer support and/or answering questions you have submitted to us. Please see section 4 below for details on how we use your Personal Data.
Where we rely on your consent to process Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object.
If you have any questions about the lawful basis upon which we collect and use your personal data, please feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer at:
privacy@lokalise.com
.
4. How will we use your Personal Data
How we use your Personal Data will depend on which Services you use, how you use the Platform and the choices you make in your settings. Personal Data that is transferred by our Customer to Lokalise in connection with the use of the Platform will be used and processed by us in compliance with the Customer’s instructions, including any applicable contract terms, and as required by applicable law.
When Lokalise is the controller of the Personal Data (as described below), we use the User Data for operating our Platform, delivering Services, and doing our business.
To provide you with our Platform.
We process certain User Data (such as technical data and web logs) to operate our Platform and deliver to you our Website and Services.
To facilitate contractual and pre-contractual business relationships.
We use Personal Data to enter into business relationships with prospective customers and to perform the contractual obligations under the contracts that we have with existing Customers. For example, we may collect your Personal Data to schedule calls and meetings for the Platform’s demo, preparing offers to you or setting up and managing a Team’s Workspace on the Platform and performing certain accounting, auditing and billing activities.
To comply with our regulatory and other legal obligations,
including Data Processing requirements of the GDPR and “Anti-Money Laundering” (AML) and “Know-Your-Customer” (KYC) obligations.
To personalize the Platform for you by understanding your needs.
We use the User Data to customize our Services for you, including providing recommendations for translations, personalized content and the Team’s Workspace management. For example, our built-in translation memory saves all the information that you upload or set via API for later, automated use in the course of translating.
To create new features, tools and products.
For example, we may improve functionality by using the User Data to help determine and rank the relevance of content to you and make Services suggestions based on historical use and predictive models. For example, based on your translation history, thus we may identify organizational trends and insights based on the translation history of projects on the Platform.
For research and analysis.
We conduct aggregate analysis, market research and planning, develop business intelligence, generate statistical studies that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.
For customer support.
We process User Data submitted to us via email, in-app chats, calls or other means of communications to provide you customer support (e.g. to answer questions you have submitted to us). Your emails, calls and other correspondence to and from us may be recorded for the purpose of improving our customer service, including monitoring customer service quality or compliance, checking the accuracy of the information you provide us or providing training for our personnel or customer service representatives only upon your preliminary consent. Any information obtained from you through Customer support will be treated according to the provisions of this Policy. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before processing your information for improving our customer service. Where technically possible, we will remove your personal information before we process your data, which then is no longer Personal Data, further for these purposes.
To protect Lokalise, our Customers and the public.
We use your Personal Data to ensure network and information security throughout the Platform, to prevent, investigate or address service errors, security or technical issues and abuses that could harm Lokalise, our Customers or the public.
For Services-related communications.
We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages, and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our offerings and important Services-related notices, such as security notices, changes in the privacy policy and terms of the Services. These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not unsubscribe from them.
For marketing and events-related communications.
We sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about Lokalise, our products and services, invite you to participate in our events or surveys, or otherwise communicate with you for marketing purposes, provided that we do so per the applicable consent requirements. These are marketing messages (described in more detail below), so you can control whether you receive them.
For interest-based advertising.
When you visit our Platform, both we and certain third parties collect information about your online activities over time and across different sites to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your specific interests (this type of advertising is called “interest-based advertising”). These third parties may place or recognize a unique cookie or other technology on your browser (including the use of pixel tags). Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before processing your information for interest-based advertising.
5. Personal Data Lokalise does not collect
No Sensitive Data.
We do not intentionally collect, store, process or transmit any sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information or religious information. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data. We might erase the sensitive information that is uploaded to the Platform or otherwise provided to us without our request or consent, if such erasure is necessary for the public interest or compliance with our legal obligations.
Lokalise is not a Business Associate or subcontractor as defined in terms of the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (the “HIPAA”).
Lokalise will have no liability for any Sensitive Personal Information, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.
We use a third-party payment processor to process payments made to us. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any financial information such as full credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third-party processor, Stripe, whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy, which may be viewed at
https://stripe.com/us/privacy
. We only have access to limited Personal Data in Stripe (i.e., name and email address), and only use this information to verify payments made to us.
No Minorities Data.
If you're a child under the age of 16, you may not have an account on Lokalise. We do not knowingly direct any of our content specifically to or collect information from children under 16. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 16, we will, unfortunately, have to close your account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Lokalise. You may not use Lokalise in California if you are a California resident under 16.
No End-User Data.
We do not intentionally collect the Personal Data of Customers’ end-users that might be stored in your account. Information and content in a Customer's accounts belong to the Customer, and the Customer is fully responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. Any Personal Data within a Team’s Workspace is the responsibility of the Customer, namely the account's owner. The Customer shall be considered as the controller for the purposes of the GDPR. Please see Section 12 below for details.
No decisions are made based on your User Data that go beyond the automated translation services of our Platform. No automated decision-making pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR takes place.
6. How We Disclose Personal Data
Please note that our Customers determine their policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of the Personal Data under their control and Lokalise does not control how they or any other third parties choose to share or disclose such Personal Data.
We share your Personal Data with trusted entities with your explicit consent, based on our instructions and in compliance with appropriate confidentiality and security measures, as outlined below:
To Third-Party Vendors and Partners.
We do share your Personal Data with a limited number of third-party vendors and business partners who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Services, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our Privacy Policy. Our vendors perform functions such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, data storage and other related services. The updated list of our Sub-processors can be found here
https://lokalise.com/sub-processors
.
To Third-Party Services.
Our Platform enables integrations with third-party software that our Customers may use (e.g., Jira, Asana, GitHub). Available integrations, plugins and libraries can be found here
https://lokalise.com/product/apps
. The Customer has sole discretion over whether to use these integrations. Once enabled, Lokalise may share certain information with a Third-Party Service provider and vice versa. For example, we will share configuration parameters, including emails linked to the Team’s Workspace to allow software management tools to integrate into said Workspace.
To Corporate Affiliates.
We share User Data with our corporate affiliates (parents and/or subsidiaries) for internal administrative, operational, and group business purposes.
To Customer's Representatives.
Authorized Customer representatives and personnel designated as 'owners' of a Team’s Workspace may be able to access, modify, or restrict access to Personal Data of the Customer’s Authorized Users. It may include, for example, your employer using Service features to export activity logs from a Team’s Workspace or accessing or modifying your profile details.
During a Change to Lokalise's Business.
Some or all User Data may be shared or transferred, subject to standard confidentiality arrangements, if Lokalise engages in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of Lokalise's assets or stock, financing, public offering of securities, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such activities (e.g., legal due diligence).
To Share Aggregated Data.
We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified Information with others about how our customers, collectively, use Lokalise, or how our customers respond to our other offerings, such as conferences and events. For instance, we may compile statistics on the proportion of customers by industry and size. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.
To Collaborate with Others.
When an Authorized User submits Personal Data, it may be displayed to other Authorized Users. For example, your profile information, including email address, may be shared with other Authorized Users working in the same Team’s Workspace.
To Share in Public.
When you comment on our blogs or in our community forums, the information you provide on these resources may also be read, collected, used and shared by any visitors to these resources. It would be best if you were cautious when deciding whether to disclose your Personal Data in these areas related to the Platform. To request removal of your Personal Data from our community forums or social media pages, contact us at:
privacy@lokalise.com
. We may not be able to remove your Personal Data, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
To Comply with Laws.
If we receive a request for information, we may disclose User Data if we reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation, or legal process. Please find more in Section 15 hereof to understand how Lokalise responds to requests to disclose data from government agencies and other sources.
To enforce our rights, prevent fraud and for safety.
To protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Lokalise or third parties, including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection with investigating and preventing fraud or security issues.
We
do not
share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Data with third parties for their commercial purposes, except where you have specifically told us to (such as by activating an integration with third-party service providers).
We
do not
host advertising on Lokalise. We may occasionally embed content from third-party sites, such as YouTube and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the number of ads our embedded content contains, we cannot always control what third parties show. Any advertisements on individual Lokalise web pages are not sponsored or tracked by Lokalise.
We do not disclose your Personal Information outside Lokalise, except in the situations listed in this section.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agem third party in a manner not specified in this Policy, OIDF will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of Personal Data should be sent to us as specified in the "How to Contact Us" section below.
Certain personal data, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, is considered "Sensitive information." OIDF will not use Sensitive Personal for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual unless OfDF has received your affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in).
7. What are your data protection rights
A. Your data protection rights.
We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data. Depending on your location and subject to applicable law, you may have a specific range of rights concerning the Personal Data we hold on you.

. We take each request seriously. We will comply with your request to the extent required by applicable law. If you feel that you have not received a satisfactory response from us, you may consult with the data protection authority in your country.
C. Verification Procedure.
For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before responding to your request, such as by verifying that the email address from which you sent the request matches the email address that we have on file for you. If we no longer need to process Personal Data about you to provide our Services, we will not maintain, acquire or additionally process information to identify you in order to respond to your request.
D. Notice to California residents.
If you are a natural person resident in California, then, subject to certain limits under California law, you have the right under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and certain other privacy and data protection laws, as applicable, to exercise free of charge:
(1)  Disclosure of Personal Information We Collect About You. You have the right to know:
The categories of personal information we have collected about you;
The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information, if any; and
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
Please note that we are not required to:
Retain any personal information about you that was collected for a single one-time transaction if, in the ordinary course of business, that information about you is not retained;
Reidentify or otherwise link any data that, in the ordinary course of business, is not maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information; or
Provide the personal information to you more than twice in a 12-month period.
(2)  Disclosure of Personal Information Sold or Used for a Business Purpose. In connection with any personal information we may sell or disclose to a third party for a business purpose, you have the right to know (i) the categories of personal information about you that we sold and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold; and, (ii) the categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business purpose.
(3)  Protection Against Discrimination. You have the right to not be discriminated against by us because you exercised any of your rights under the CCPA. This means we cannot, among other things:
Deny goods or services to you;
Charge different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
Provide a different level or quality of goods or services to you; or
Suggest that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
Please note that we may charge a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of services to you, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by your personal information.
8. Cookies
As further described in our
Cookie Policy
, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different Services and devices. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our
Cookie Policy
. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools.
9. How do we store your data
Data Retention Period.
We will process and store the User Data no longer than necessary. Subsequently, the Personal Data will be deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.
In general, your Personal Data will be stored during the term of our contractual relationships. However, in some cases, Personal Data may be stored for longer due to laws applicable to Lokalise or for as long as the retention of Personal Data is required due to other legal reasons (e.g. in accordance with Art. 17 (3) GDPR). Thus, among other things, storage and documentation obligations from commercial and tax laws apply. The retention and documentation periods specified there are six to ten years. In addition, the storage period for all other data is based on the statutory limitation periods, which are generally three years.
This may include keeping your Personal Data after you have deactivated your account for the necessary period for us to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
10. Security of Customer Data
We take the security of data very seriously. We work hard to protect User Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure. Lokalise has received internationally recognized SOC 2 Type 2 security certification confirming that Lokalise has system and organization controls to safeguard the processing, integrity, confidentiality and security of the User Data. To learn more about current practices and policies regarding the security and confidentiality of the Services, please see our documentation and Contracts.
Please note that no method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and safety. In the event of a data breach that affects your Personal Data, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected users without undue delay.
11. Privacy Policies of other websites
Our Platform provides the ability to connect to the websites of other Third-Party Services providers. Please see Section 6 above for details. These Third-Party Services are not owned or controlled by Lokalise, and third parties that have been granted access to your Personal Data may have their own policies and practices for data collection and use. Please check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services or contact the relevant provider with any questions you may have.
You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our message to users based on a range of factors, including demographic data, users' inferred interests and browsing context (for example, the time and date of your visit to our Platform, the pages that you viewed and the links that you clicked on). This technology also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and understand if you have seen one of our advertisements. Where required by applicable law (e.g. under GDPR), we will obtain your consent before processing your information for interest-based advertising.
Please see Subsection 7A above to learn more about for various un-subscription options from Third-Party Services you have.
12. Identifying Data Controller and Processor
Data protection law in certain jurisdictions (e.g., the GDPR) differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of Personal Data.
If you are an Authorized User of our Customer, or if you are our Customer yourself, please note that Customer is deemed the controller of all Personal Data that our Customer or its Authorized Users transfer to Lokalise in connection with the use of the Platform and/or the Services. We only process such Personal Data on behalf of our Customer as a processor. Therefore, requests on such Personal Data should initially be submitted directly to our Customer. Please refer to our
“Notice to Individuals”
for more information.
Otherwise (for example, if you are a visitor to our Website who has not signed up to our Platform) we are deemed the controller of your Personal Data. Thus, you have the right to address your requests on the processing of Personal Data to us (please see section 16 for contact details).
Insofar as we are the controller of Personal Data, this is the following company:
Lokalise, Inc.
3500 South DuPont Highway, Suite BZ-101
Dover, DE 19901
United States
privacy@lokalise.com
13. International Data Transfers
We are a global business. Personal Data may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations or where we engage service providers. We may transfer Personal Data that we maintain about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the Personal Data was originally collected, including to the United States.

Choices and Means to Limit Use and Disclosure of Personal Data - please see section 7 (Your rights)
Lokalise is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Lokalise’s liability regarding onward transfers is limited according to our terms of service or applicable MSA.
If you are located in the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we comply with applicable laws to provide an adequate level of data protection for the transfer of your Personal Data to other countries outside of the EEA, UK or Switzerland (“Third Countries”). Please note that some Third Countries, and certain entities within the USA who are not certified under the DPF, do not guarantee an adequate level of data protection. Transferring data to these Third Countries may therefore involve additional risks for your privacy rights. For example, the enforcement of your rights can be more difficult in these Third Countries.
However, we use our best efforts to ensure that an international data transfer to Third Countries, or a transfer to a non-DFP certified US entity, is governed by an adequate data transfer mechanism based on a risk assessment (comparable to a data protection impact assessment) regarding the transfer. We rely on one or more of the following mechanisms: EU and or UK Standard Contractual Clauses with a data recipient outside the EEA or UK (as the case may be), verification that the recipient has implemented Binding Corporate Rules and/or verification that the European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR for the respective Third Country.
14. Onward Transfer
Lokalise may disclose personal information to subcontractors and third-party agents who assist Lokalise in providing its services. Before disclosing personal information to a subcontractor or third-party agent, Lokalise will obtain assurances from the recipient that it will: (a) use the personal information only to assist Lokalise in providing the services; (b) provide at least the same level of protection for personal information as required by the DPF Principles; and (c) notify Lokalise if the recipient is no longer able to provide the required protections. Upon notice, Lokalise will act promptly to stop and remediate unauthorized processing of personal information by a recipient. Lokalise will remain liable for onward transfers to its subcontractors and third-party agents.
Lokalise may also be required to disclose, and may disclose, personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent permitted, Lokalise will inform its relevant customer or prospective customer before making such disclosure and provide it with a reasonable opportunity to object to such disclosure.

As a developer, you can use Google Tag Manager to implement and manage
measurement tags and pixels in your mobile applications, without having to
rebuild and resubmit application binaries to app marketplaces. Developers who
work with the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK can easily add Tag Manager to
help manage and make changes to the implementation, even after the app has
shipped.
Developers can log important events and decide later which tags or pixels should
be fired.
Prerequisites
In the
Firebase console
, add your app to your Firebase project.
Set up Google Analytics
for your app, including enabling Google Analytics
in your Firebase project and adding the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK to
your app.
Create a Tag Manager account
.
Configure a Tag Manager container
.
The following sections walk you through the steps to configure and use Google
Tag Manager in your iOS application.
1.
Add Tag Manager to your project
Add the Tag Manager package:
CocoaPods
Swift Package Manager
More
To add Tag Manager via
CocoaPods
:
In a terminal, run the following command:
$
sudo
gem
install
cocoapods
Change to your project directory.
Run the following command to create a file named
Podfile
:
$
pod
init
In
Podfile
, add the following:
pod
'GoogleTagManager'
,
'~> 6.0'
Run the following command to download and install Tag Manager
dependencies to your project:
$
pod
install
To add Tag Manager via the
Swift Package Manager
:
If migrating from a CocoaPods-based project, run
pod deintegrate
to
remove CocoaPods from your Xcode project. The CocoaPods-generated
.xcworkspace
file can safely be deleted afterward. If you're adding
Firebase to a project for the first time, this step can be ignored.
In Xcode 12, install the Tag Manager library by navigating to
File > Tag Manager Packages > Add Package Dependency…
In the prompt that appears, enter the Tag Manager GitHub
repository:
https
:
//github.com/googleanalytics/google-tag-manager-ios-sdk.git
Select the version of Tag Manager you want to use. For new
projects, we recommend using the latest version of Tag Manager.
Add
-ObjC
to
Other Linker Flags
in the
Build Settings
of
your project.
Create an iOS container if your Tag Manager account doesn't have one:
Sign in to your
Tag Manager
account.
In the
Accounts
tab, select your iOS container.
Click
Admin
in the top navigation bar.
On the
CONTAINER
column, click the '+' icon to create a container.
Enter a container name.
Select
iOS
container.
Click
Create
.
Download your container:
Sign in to your
Tag Manager
account.
In the
Accounts
tab, select your iOS container.
Click
Versions
in the top navigation bar.
Select the version of the container you want to download.
Click
Download
.
Note:
The name of the downloaded file is the container ID with a
.json
extension.
Add the downloaded container to your project:
Copy the downloaded file into a folder called
container
in the XCode
project root (usually
PROJECT_ROOT/container/GTM-XXXXXX.json
).
Open Xcode.
From the
File
menu, choose
Add files to...
Select the
container
folder.
Click
Options
and make sure
Create folder references
is
selected.
Click
Finish
.
2.
Log events and variables
Tag Manager uses events, parameters, and user properties logged by the Google
Analytics for Firebase SDK to trigger and build tags you've configured in
Google Tag Manager.
Read the
Firebase developer documentation
for instructions on how to
log events
and
set user properties
.
Configure variables in Tag Manager
To capture the value of event parameters and user properties for use in Google
Tag Manager, you can
configure variables
in the Tag Manager interface.
For example, you could log the following custom event in your app:
Analytics
.
logEvent
(
"share_image"
,
parameters
:
[
"image_name"
:
name
,
"full_text"
:
text
])
Then, you could configure new Event Parameter variables in Tag Manager as
follows to capture the
image_name
and
full_text parameter
values:
Variable Name
: Image Name
Variable Type
: Event Parameter
Event Parameter Key Name
:
image_name
and:
Variable Name
: Full Text
Variable Type
: Event Parameter
Event Parameter Key Name
:
full_text
Similarly, you could set the following user property in your app:
Analytics
.
setUserProperty
(
food
,
forName
:
"favorite_food"
)
Then, you could configure a new Firebase User Property variable in Google Tag
Manager to capture the
favorite_food
value:
Variable Name
: Favorite Food
Variable Type
: Firebase User Property
Event Parameter Key Name
:
favorite_food
Modify and block events
Tag Manager enables you to modify and block events before they are logged by the
Google Analytics for Firebase SDK. Modifying events can help you add, remove, or
change the values of event parameters or adjust event names without app updates.
Events that are not blocked will be logged by the Google Analytics for Firebase
SDK.
The Google Analytics for Firebase SDK also automatically logs some
events
and
user properties
. You can use  automatically collected events and properties in
Tag Manager without needing to add any code. However, you can't block them.
3. Send events
Firebase event name variables, Firebase event parameter variables, and other
variables are used to set up
triggers
. Trigger conditions are evaluated
whenever you log a Firebase event. By default, Google Analytics for Firebase
events automatically fire. It is possible to add a Google Analytics for Firebase
tag in Tag Manager to block events from being sent to Google Analytics.
4. Preview, debug, and publish your container
Before publishing a version of your container, you'll want to preview it to make
sure it works as intended. Tag Manager enables you to preview versions of your
container by generating links and QR codes in the Tag Manager web interface and
using them to open your application.
Preview container
To preview a container, generate a preview URL in the Tag Manager web
interface:
Sign in to your
Tag Manager
account.
Select a mobile container.
Click
Versions
in the top navigation bar.
Click
Actions > Preview
on the container version you'd like to preview.
Enter your application's package name.
Click
Generate begin preview link
.
Figure 1:
Getting a preview URL from the
    Tag Manager web interface.
Save this preview URL for later steps.
To enable container previews, you must define the Tag Manager preview URL scheme
in your project's property list. Under
URL types
of your application's
property list file, register the following URL identifier and URL scheme:
URL identifier
:
_your.package.name_
URL scheme
:
tagmanager.c._your.package.name_
Figure 2:
Add the Tag Manager preview URL scheme
  to your application's property list file.
Note:
your.package.name
must match the name of the app used to generate the
preview URL (see Figure 1).
Stop your application and open the preview URL on an emulator or physical device
to preview the draft container in your application.
Debug container
When you run your app in a simulator or in preview mode, Tag Manager
automatically turns logging to verbose.
Publish container
After you preview your container and verify that it is working, you can
publish it
. After you have published your container, your tag configurations
will become available to mobile app users.
Note:
For mobile containers, a default container is used to set initial tag
configurations until the first time a container is downloaded. Once the app has
connected to the internet and downloaded a container, it will never use the
default container again. Applications periodically check for container updates,
typically every 12 hours.
