We use third-party analytics services to collect data about usage of our services. A Producer may allow third-party advertising companies (including advertising agencies, networks, and delivery vendors) to collect data regarding advertisements that they may place on our websites. Third-party analytics providers and advertising companies may use cookies to track your activities.

Collection and Use of Personal Information of Children Under the Age of 16
Our Website is not intended for children under 16 years of age.  No one under age 16 may provide any personal information to or on the Website. Our Website and SVOD are intended to be used by adults, or under the direct supervision of an adult parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.

If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us immediately at support@yippee.tv.
California residents under 16 years of age may have additional rights regarding the collection and sale of their personal information. Please see our California Resident Privacy Rights for more information.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
Yippee is committed to protecting the online privacy of children.  However, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, Yippee is excluded from the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Although not expressly covered by COPPA, Yippee strives to meet COPPA’s requirements as part of Yippee’s commitment to protecting children online. Prior to providing any personally identifiable information (name, e-mail address, address, phone number etc.), either by setting up a SVOD account, entering a contest or sweepstakes (if eligible), or participating in any other activity offered through the Website or SVOD, children under the age of sixteen (16) must have a parent or legal guardian complete and return a parental consent form to Yippee. The consent form will require the child’s Parent(s) or Legal Guardian(s) to provide their name, signature, and expressly consent to the collection and transfer of the child’s personally identifiable information.  Consent may be revoked by sending Yippee written Revocation of Parental Consent correspondence and sending it to support@yippee.tv or to Yippee Entertainment, Inc., Attn: Customer Service, 2442 Michelle Dr., Tustin, CA 92780. Yippee is sensitive about children consulting with parents or guardians before furnishing personal information or ordering anything online and urges parents and/or guardians to discuss issues related thereto with their child(ren).
Children’s Advertising Review Unit.
It is also Yippee’s intention to adhere to the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) Guidelines on Internet advertising with its special sensitivities regarding solicitations to children under sixteen (16). Yippee encourages parents/guardians to supervise and join their children in exploring cyberspace. Yippee is proud of its SVOD and believes it is suitable for Yippee fans of all ages.
Children’s Information and Third-Party Sponsors
. Occasionally, Yippee may ask, on a voluntary basis and with prior parental permission, if appropriate, for personal information to provide to sponsors of particular activities and/or products.  This will be made clear in each individual case where we have third-party sponsors.  In the event children under the age of sixteen (16) are eligible, with parental consent, to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other activities offered through our site, we will only collect and use information (e.g., e-mail address, mailing address, name, age) to the extent that it is necessary to administer the activity.  We will never require that, as a condition of participation, a child disclose more information than is necessary to participate in an activity.
Failure to Obtain Parental Permission
. Please note that if a parent does not permit Yippee’s use or collection of personally identifiable information or has instructed Yippee to delete personally identifiable information, a child’s participation on the Website or SVOD and/or related activities for which the personally identifiable information has been requested may not be possible.
Personal Information Disclosure to Third Parties.
Yippee will not disclose information collected from children under the age of sixteen (16) (or from adults for that matter) to third parties unless indicated otherwise or in special cases where Yippee has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (whether intentionally or unintentionally) with Yippee’s rights or property or anyone else who may be harmed by such actions or if required by law.
Parental Monitoring and Control Tools.
Yippee recommends that parents/guardians monitor and supervise the online activities of their children and to consider using available parental control tools which can prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. Visitors to Yippee’s Website or SVOD who are under sixteen (16) years old should not be submitting any personal information like their name, address, e-mail address, phone number etc. without a parent’s or guardian’s permission.
