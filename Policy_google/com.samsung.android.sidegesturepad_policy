SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: July 1, 2024
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its affiliates (referred to as “Samsung Electronics”, “Samsung”, or “we” in this Privacy Policy) know how important privacy is to our customers. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Samsung devices and services where we process personal information, from mobile phones, tablets, TVs and home appliances, to the customer services and online services we provide on our Samsung website. We will refer to these devices and services as the “Services” in this Privacy Policy.
It is important that you check back often for updates to the Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices with respect to the Services or changes in applicable law. We will post a notice on our website or on your device to notify you in advance of material changes to our Privacy Policy and indicate at the top of the Privacy Policy when it was most recently updated. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will always be available here:
https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy

In addition to this Privacy Policy, Samsung also provides specific privacy notices related to certain products and services, or specific jurisdictions. Where you have a Samsung Account, the Samsung Account Privacy Notice tells you how Samsung uses your personal information, which you can access here:

You will be given further specific privacy notices before using Services for which Samsung uses your personal information.

Information You Provide Directly
Some Services enable you to provide us information directly. For example:
When you create an account or profile with us, we ask for information such as your name, date of birth, or contact information such as phone number and email address.
If you order a product or paid service from us, we also ask for your name, address, contact information, and shipping and payment information such as card number, expiration date, and security code to process your order. You can also choose to save your payment information with us so you can check out more easily next time.
To provide responses when you contact Customer Service, we ask for certain information to verify your identity, the Service you are inquiring about (including repair history), and information related to your consultation (including recordings of your voice and chat or communication transcripts).
Demographic data (such as gender and age).
Information you provide when you apply for credit or financing, such as your social security number.
If you share your contacts, we will collect their phone numbers and other contact information to facilitate file sharing and messaging. You can turn off or restrict these features in the Settings on your devices.

We use third-party analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, and Adobe Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyze your use of the Services and to improve the Services.

3.
Service Providers:

HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?
We take data protection seriously. We have put in place physical and technical safeguards to keep your information secure. However, please note that although we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure.
WHERE DO WE SEND YOUR DATA?
Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information within and outside of your country of residence where necessary. In particular, your personal information will be transferred to the Republic of Korea.
Please note that the data protection laws and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. We take appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable law, to ensure that your personal information remains protected.
For European Economic Area (EEA), UK and Swiss residents only:
We will comply with applicable European data protection law when transferring your personal information outside of Europe.

WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?
Your personal information belongs to you. You have the right to ask us to provide details about what we have collected and to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to delete it, or correct any inaccuracies.

You also have the following additional rights.
You can ask us to restrict or limit processing, sharing or the transfer of your personal information.

If you have provided your consent to Samsung processing your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time. We will apply your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdrew your consent.
You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy. Please note that there are legal exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and we may need to retain information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, compliance with legal obligations, or where we otherwise have a legitimate and legal reason to do so.

https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en
, for the UK at
https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/
and in Switzerland, at
https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/deredoeb/kontakt.html
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
We will not keep your personal information for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. This means that information will be destroyed or erased from our systems when it is no longer required. In some cases, your personal information will be anonymized which means you can no longer be identified from the information.
We take appropriate steps to ensure that we process and retain information about you based on the following logic:
At least the duration for which the information is used to provide you with a service;
As required under law, a contract, or with regard to our statutory obligations;
Only for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, is processed, or for longer if required under any contract, by applicable law, or for statistical purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards.
WHAT THIRD-PARTY SERVICES DO WE USE?
Some of the content, advertising, and functionality in our Services is provided by third parties. These third parties may use cookies, beacons, tracking pixels, and other tools to collect information about your use of these Services. These third parties are not controlled directly by Samsung, so we recommend that you check their privacy policies to understand how they use your data.
For some apps and services, including social networks, we receive and store sign-in information, as well as other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these apps and services.
COOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
We, along with certain third parties such as content providers and advertisers, use technologies called cookies, beacons, or pixels, as well as other tools (collectively known as “technologies”) that communicate information from your device to a server, including those owned by third parties. These technologies can be embedded in online content, videos, and advertisements. They allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular advertisement, and determine the time and date on which you viewed the content as well as information about your device, including the IP address of your device. Among other purposes, these technologies help us to do the following:
(1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it
(2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services
(3) personalize the Services to your preferences
(4) manage and measure the usability of the Services
(5) understand the effectiveness of our communications
(6) improve our Services

US SUPPLEMENT TO THE SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: July 1, 2024
This US Supplement to the Samsung Privacy Policy (“US Supplement”) describes additional personal information practices concerning United States residents and should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Samsung Privacy Policy and this US Supplement, the terms of this US Supplement shall apply.
Additional Uses of Your Information
In addition to the purposes described above in the
HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION SECTION?
we may also use personal information about United States residents for other purposes, such as to develop and train our artificial intelligence algorithms and models.
Biometric Data Stored on Your Device Not Accessible by Samsung
In addition to the categories of personal information Samsung may obtain described above, certain Services may use your biometric data that is stored on your device to provide product or service functionality (e.g. use your fingerprint data to unlock your device or grant you access to certain Services, or your voiceprint data to create a customized Bixby Voice wake-up command). Samsung also may generate certain biometric data automatically when certain Services are used (e.g., Samsung’s face-clustering technology may group together images of the same face from different photographs stored on your device (“Face-Clustering Data”)).
This biometric data remains on your device and is not transferred to or accessed or obtained by Samsung. Samsung does not share this biometric data with third parties. Face-Clustering Data will remain on your device unless you clear the cache in your system settings, reset your device to its factory setting, or delete the relevant photos from your device. You can delete your registered biometric data or your Bixby Voice wake-up command from your device at any time in the applicable settings. Because Samsung does not have access to this data, Samsung cannot delete it for you.
Online Tracking And Personalized Advertising
Through certain Services, both we and various third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.
Samsung Ads
Our Samsung Ads service is designed to serve advertisements that are personalized to users’ interests on Samsung and third-party platforms, devices, websites, and apps. Samsung Ads may deliver personalized ads based on your demographic characteristics, preferences, choices, and interests by collecting certain information about your online activities.
Ad networks
Because Samsung participates in various advertising networks, you may also see our ads on other websites or mobile apps. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests, and browsing context. These networks can track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, pixels, device identifiers, server logs, and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing and app usage activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on certain Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn how to opt out of ad network interest-based advertising in the U.S., please visit
www.aboutads.info/choices
and
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
To serve interest-based ads, we may share your personal information by allowing certain third parties (such as online advertising services) to collect your personal information via automated technologies and server-to-server connections on the Services. This kind of sharing may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the use of personal information to serve “targeted advertising” under certain privacy laws.
State Law Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights available to you as described in the What Are Your Rights? section of the Privacy Policy, you may also, subject to applicable law, request to opt out of the (1) sale of your personal information, (2) sharing of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes, (3) processing of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, (4) collection or processing of your sensitive data, or (5) collection of your personal information through the operation of a voice recognition feature. In addition, you may, subject to applicable law, request a list of specific third parties to whom we have disclosed personal data.
How to Submit a Request
:
To submit an access, deletion or correction request, or to opt out of the (a) sale of your personal information, (b) sharing of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes, or (c) processing of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, click
here
or call us at 1-800-SAMSUNG (1-800-726-7864). You may also choose to opt-out of targeted advertising on Samsung.com by turning on an opt-out preference signal through your browser. You will need to turn it on for each browser and each device you use. We use an automated solution to process opt-out signals. We do not respond to browser-based signals that do not meet applicable state law requirements, which may include older Do Not Track signals.
To opt out of the collection and processing of your sensitive personal information, you can withdraw your consent in the applicable app settings where you have given your consent, if applicable delete your Samsung Account, or call us at the number above. To opt out of the collection of personal information collected through the operation of a voice recognition feature, you can stop using the feature or leave the applicable app or service that provides the feature in the settings.
