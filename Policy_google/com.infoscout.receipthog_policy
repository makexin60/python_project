HOW WE MAY SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
We may share aggregated and anonymized insights and reports about consumer and purchase behavior with clients, affiliates, partners, or other third parties for research, marketing, analysis and other purposes.
From time to time, we may share personal information related to your purchase or receipt information and/or survey responses with clients or other third parties for advertising, marketing research or analytics purposes (e.g., to help them better understand consumer preferences or segments, or serve more relevant advertising or measure advertising effectiveness) or to help us better understand the accuracy of such information or responses.  In these cases, we limit the types of identifiers we may share (e.g., mobile ad ids, hashed emails, etc.) and restrict the ways in which third parties may use this data.  We will only engage in this type of sharing if we have obtained your consent to do so or if we believe we have another appropriate legal basis to do so or are otherwise permitted to do so under applicable law.
We may share information we obtain with third party service providers or data processors that provide services on our behalf, such as data analytics and IT services. These third parties have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us.
We may share information with government organizations and agencies, law enforcement and regulators (1) to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules, and requests of law enforcement, regulatory and other governmental agencies; (2)  to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm or financial loss; or (4) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

California Consumer Privacy Rights
You have certain choices regarding your personal information, as described below.
Access: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold or shared about you during the past 12 months.
Correction: You have the right to request that we correct the personal information we maintain about you, if that information is inaccurate.
Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.
Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information or the sharing of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes.
Shine the Light Request: You also may have the right to request that we provide you with (a) a list of certain categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and (b) the identity of those third parties.
How to Submit a Request.
To submit an access, correction, or deletion request, please either email us at
privacy@receipthog.com
, submit a request for support through the Receipt Hog app or our websites, or mail us at the address provided in our Privacy Policy under the heading “Contact Us”.  You can opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information by clicking here
[insert “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link]
or broadcasting the Global Privacy Control signal.  To submit a Shine the Light request, email us at privacy@receipthog.com. To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer, please contact us as described in this section.
Verifying Requests:
To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.  If you have an account with us, we will verify your identity by requiring you to sign in to your account and/or answer security questions related to your account.  If you do not have an account with us, or an email address on file with us (such as if you signed up to receive our marketing emails), then there may not be a reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by the CCPA.  This is because historically we have not linked device identifiers or advertising IDs to named actual persons.  Accordingly, if you do not have an account with us, or an email address on file, and you request access to, correction of or deletion of your personal information, we will not be able to process your request at this time.
Additional Information.
If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.  This section is available in alternative formats upon request.  To request it in an alternative format, please either email us at
privacy@receipthog.com
, submit a request for support through the Receipt Hog app or our websites or mail us at the address provided in our Privacy Policy under the heading “Contact Us”.
