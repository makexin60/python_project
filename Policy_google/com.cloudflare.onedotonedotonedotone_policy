Application Privacy Policy
Last updated: February 7, 2025
We have updated our February 23, 2023, Application Privacy Policy to add
contact information about our entities in Mexico and Malaysia.
This Application Privacy Policy (“
Application Privacy Policy
”) outlines the information that Cloudflare gathers, how we use that information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such information when you use the Cloudflare Application(s). As used in this Application Privacy Policy, “Cloudflare,” “Us” or “We” refers to Cloudflare, Inc. and its affiliates as listed at the end of this policy. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Application Terms of Service
.
This Application Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of the Application as part of Cloudflare Zero Trust, in which case the
Cloudflare Privacy Policy
applies.
1. Scope of Policy
Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.
This Policy only applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in connection with the use of the Cloudflare Application(s). This Policy does not apply to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Application when the Application is used as part of a Cloudflare Zero Trust account, as described in more detail in Section 3.
2. Information We Collect
We only collect and store the minimum amount of data we believe is required to operate and improve the Application. There are three categories of data that we collect: Account Data, Operational Data, and DNS Resolver Information as described more fully below. Your Account Data and Operational Data are pseudonymized. Your DNS Resolver Information is anonymized at our edge data centers.
We do not collect your name, phone number, or credit card information (or records of any payments collected by the applicable App Store). The only information we receive from the applicable App Store is a limited amount of information that we need to confirm your subscription for a Service. We do not receive from the App Store any of your personal data or other information about your App Store account. We only receive your email address (and name, if you voluntarily provide it) if you have decided to give us feedback and/or report bugs.
We promise to keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. We will not share or otherwise disclose your personal information except as necessary to provide our services or as otherwise described in this Application Privacy Policy without first providing you with notice and the opportunity to consent.
2.1 Account Data
When you install the Application on your device, create or update your account, sign up for a Paid Application Service, or participate in one of our referral programs, we collect and store the “
Account Data
” described below, depending on your use of the Application.
Account Data
Information Type
Purpose
Account
We use account information, such as your account ID,
to administer your account and authorize Internet requests
from your device to the Cloudflare network.
Subscription
If you subscribe to Paid Application Services,
we use subscription information,
such as your order ID, to administer those subscriptions.
Referral
If you participate in our referral programs,
we use referral information, such as your registration ID,
to credit referrals to you.
2.2 Operational Data
Cloudflare also collects and stores “
Operational Data
” when you connect to our network. This data is required to operate and improve our Application.
Operational Data
Information Type
Purpose
Request data (Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP)
When you connect to our network, we see your IP address and use it to assign you a Cloudflare IP address corresponding to the country in which you are connecting from. We do not retain a link between the IP address you use to access the Internet via our Application and the websites you visit.
Performance data
We track the services you have enabled and the amount of data you have transferred via the Application. We also use performance data to understand how the Application impacts your Internet connection and to improve our Application. Performance Data does not include personal information.
Device data
We use information regarding your device, such as device model and operating system, for troubleshooting and to improve our Application. This data does not include unique device identifiers.
Crash Logs
We use crash log information regarding your device’s use of the Application for troubleshooting and to improve our Application. Crash logs do not contain your IP addresses or other personal information.
Connection Data
We retain anonymized network information to look for connection problems between your device and Cloudflare’s network. You may disable the reporting of anonymized network information in the Application.
Feedback/Bug Reports
We require your email address when you provide feedback and bug reports. When you provide feedback, you can choose whether to share your console logs. Console logs can include your device name and IP address. We use this information for troubleshooting and to improve our Application. Your email address will be deleted 6 months from the date of collection.
2.3 DNS Resolver Information
We collect limited DNS query data that is sent to the 1.1.1.1 Public DNS resolver when you have the Application enabled on your device. The DNS query data that we retain does not contain your IP addresses or personal information, and the bulk of the data is only stored for 24 hours. You can learn more about our 1.1.1.1 Public DNS Resolver commitment to privacy
here
.
3. Cloudflare Zero Trust
The Application may be used as part of the Cloudflare Zero Trust offerings to which you or your organization may subscribe. You understand that when your device is in Cloudflare Zero Trust mode, information we collect about your use of the Application and your Internet activity will be associated with your Cloudflare Zero Trust identity (e.g., work email address), and Cloudflare will process your personal data on behalf of the Cloudflare Zero Trust organization that you have associated with your account. All information provided by you or resulting from your use of the Application as part of Cloudflare Zero Trust services to which you or your organization subscribe is collected, used, maintained, shared, and destroyed in accordance with the Cloudflare Privacy Policy, available
here
, and this Application Privacy Policy will no longer apply.
You further understand that when Cloudflare Zero Trust is enabled in the Application, Cloudflare may be able to associate your Cloudflare Zero Trust account information with your other use of the Application for up to 24 hours from when you enable Cloudflare Zero Trust.
4. How We Use Information We Collect
Cloudflare only processes personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized. We use the information we collect, as described in Section 2 to operate and improve the Application, such as to assist us in our debugging efforts if an issue arises. We may also use the information we collect to comply with legal obligations as well as to investigate and prevent violations of the Application Terms of Service. We will not combine the information collected from DNS queries with any other Cloudflare or third party data in any way that can be used to identify individual end users.

.
5. Retention
We store your personal data only as long as is necessary to provide our Application and the associated services, pursue legitimate interests, and comply with applicable laws. Your Account Data and Operational Data will be stored for no longer than two years after your last use of the Application. Information associated with feedback and bug reports may be retained longer as needed.
6. Information Sharing
We work with other companies who help us run our business (“
Service Providers
”). These companies provide services to help us operate and improve the Application, including assisting with debugging and crash analytics. These Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to our instructions and in compliance both with this Application Privacy Policy, Cloudflare’s
Privacy Policy
and other applicable confidentiality and security measures and regulations.
Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to sell any personal information we share with them, or to use any personal information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any other purpose than to perform the services they provide to us.
In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above, we may also share your information with others in the following circumstances:
Within the Cloudflare Group (defined for the purposes of this Application Privacy Policy as the Cloudflare entities listed at the end of this policy);
When we are required to disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process; or in the case of an emergency to protect any person from the danger of death or serious physical injury; or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. (Learn more about how we handle law enforcement requests
here
);
In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business;
Where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required to comply with our legal obligations; or as you may otherwise consent from time to time.
Learn more about information sharing specific to the 1.1.1.1 Public DNS Resolver
here
.
We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (California Civil Code Sec. 1798.100 et seq.), nor do we sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, including as defined under California Civil Code Sec. 1798.83.
7. Legal Basis for Processing
If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA), please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We normally will collect personal information from you only where: (a) we need your personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services you have requested), or (b) the processing is in our legitimate interests. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. We will obtain your consent where required by law. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
8. International Information Transfers
Cloudflare is a U.S.-based, global company. We primarily store your information in the United States, the European Economic Area (the “
EEA
”), and the United Kingdom. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.
Whenever Cloudflare shares personal information originating in the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland with a Cloudflare entity outside the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, it will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses (adjusted to address transfers from the United Kingdom).
If you are accessing or using our Application, you are agreeing to the transfer of your limited personal information described in Section 2 of this Application Privacy Policy to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
For users in South Korea, please see our “Addendum Applicable to Users in South Korea” to this Application Privacy Policy.
9. Privacy Shield
Cloudflare is a U.S.-based, global company. We primarily store your information in the United States and the European Economic Area. You acknowledge that to facilitate your use of the Application, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Application Privacy Policy, and we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information. We describe our additional safeguards
here
.
If you are using the Application and provide us with feedback, then you are consenting to Cloudflare processing your personal data outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland.
While Cloudflare no longer relies on the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as a lawful basis for international transfers of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S., Cloudflare remains certified under both the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks
as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EEA, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States, respectively (“Privacy Shields”). We commit to periodically review and verify the accuracy of our policies and our compliance with the Privacy Shields. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Application Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. For more information on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at:
https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome
.
If you believe that we maintain copies of your personal data within the scope of the Privacy Shields, you may direct any inquiries to
SAR@cloudflare.com
or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
. If neither we nor our dispute resolution provider are able to resolve your complaint, as a last resort you may engage in binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.
Our commitments under the Privacy Shields are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Under such circumstances, we may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of disclosure.
10. Data Subject Rights and Choices
In the event you elect to contact us to report an issue with the Application, to share feedback or to send console logs, we may receive limited personal data about you, such as your email address, that we retain for a limited period of time. You will have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your limited personal information that we retain. You may email us at
SAR@cloudflare.com
with any such subject access requests (“
SAR
”), and we will respond within thirty (30) days.
Please keep in mind that except for when you provide feedback, we don’t receive personally identifiable information from you, and we are unable to associate your identity with your Account Data or Operational Data. As a result, our ability to comply with data subject rights is limited to those circumstances in which we have your personally identifiable data.
11. Data Security, Data Integrity and Access
We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We have put in place appropriate physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
12. Notification of Changes
If we make changes to this Application Privacy Policy that we believe materially impact the privacy of your personal data, we will promptly provide notice of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), as well as post the updated Application Privacy Policy on this website noting the effective date of any changes.
13. Business Transactions
We may assign or transfer this Application Privacy Policy, as well as information covered by this Application Privacy Policy, in the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.
14. English Language Controls
Non-English translations of this Application Privacy Policy are provided for convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.

Cloudflare Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 28, 2024.
We have updated our July 18, 2024 Privacy Policy to update the contact email of our Data Protection Officer.
This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the personal information that Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we use that personal information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such personal information.
CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE
Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with our Customers, users, and the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.
We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell or rent your personal information. We will only share or otherwise disclose your personal information as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy, except in cases where we first provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.
1. POLICY APPLICATION
This Policy applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of the personal information of the following categories of data subjects:
Attendees
: Those who visit our offices or provide their information to Cloudflare or Cloudflare representatives when they attend or register to attend Cloudflare-sponsored events or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, as well as those who participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Website Visitors
: Those who visit our Websites, including those who may opt to provide an email address or other contact information to receive communications from Cloudflare, fill out a survey, or provide feedback. For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites” refer collectively to
www.cloudflare.com
as well as any other websites Cloudflare operates for its own behalf and that link to this Policy. For clarity, “Websites” does not include any sites owned or operated by our Customers, including where we serve as Registrar.
Customers
: Individuals or entities who enter into a subscription agreement with Cloudflare (or its authorized partner) and to whom Cloudflare provides Services pursuant to such agreement. For purposes of this Policy, “Services” shall refer to all of the cloud-based solutions offered, marketed, or sold by Cloudflare or its authorized partners that are designed to increase the performance, security, and availability of Internet properties, applications, devices, and networks, along with any software, software development kits, and application programming interfaces ("APIs") made available in connection with the foregoing.
Administrative Users
: Those with login credentials for a Cloudflare account and/or those who administer any of the Services for a Customer. In some cases, an Administrative User and Customer may be the same individual. In other cases, an Administrative User may be an agent acting on behalf of a Customer.
Public DNS Resolver Users
: Those who use Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 public recursive Domain Name System (“DNS”) resolver service, including 1.1.1.1 for Families ("1.1.1.1 resolver"). Learn more about the 1.1.1.1 resolver
here
.
End Users
: Those who (i) access or use our Customers’ domains, networks, websites, application programming interfaces, and applications, or (ii) Customers’ employees, agents, or contractors, who access or use Services, such as Cloudflare Zero Trust end users.
Registrants:
Users of Cloudflare’s domain registrar services. Cloudflare is an
ICANN
-accredited registrar and complies with the
2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement
(“RAA”).
This Policy does not apply to “Application Users”—those individuals who use Cloudflare’s consumer-facing 1.1.1.1 Application. See the
1.1.1.1 Application Privacy Policy
for more information about the data collection and use practices for Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Application and the associated 1.1.1.1 Application Services.
This Policy also does not apply to our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, and networks, which may have their own terms and privacy policies. Our Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to the collection of personal information, in connection with the use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.
Cloudflare’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen. Cloudflare does not knowingly collect or share personal information from any person under the age of eighteen. To the extent we become aware that we have the personal information of a person under the age of eighteen, we will delete that information.
When Cloudflare is a reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS records for websites using our Services. We are a conduit for information controlled by others. It is our Customers and their users who are responsible for the content transmitted across our network (e.g., images, written content, graphics, etc.).
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT (Categories of Data Subjects)
Attendees
Name, email address, and other contact information
: We may ask for and collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you visit our offices, register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, or participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Image and voice
: When you participate in a Cloudflare study, we may ask for your permission to record your voice and/or image during your participation in the study.
Website Visitors
Name, email address, and other contact information
: We ask for and—at your option—collect personal information from you when you submit web forms on our Websites, including opportunities to sign up for and agree to receive email communications from us. We may ask you to submit such personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Websites, including participation in surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, or studies, requesting customer support, submitting feedback, or otherwise communicating with us. We will send such communications in accordance with applicable law.
Log files
: Just as when you visit and interact with most websites and services delivered via the Internet, when you visit our Websites, including the Cloudflare Community Forum, we gather certain information and store it in log files. This information may include but is not limited to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, system configuration information, URLs of referring pages, and locale and language preferences.
Cookies and other tracking technologies
: We may use cookies and other information-gathering technologies for a variety of purposes, such as providing us with information about how you interact with our Websites and assisting us in our marketing efforts. You may view a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link (or, in the United States, the “Your Privacy Choices” link) in the footer of the Cloudflare homepage at cloudflare.com or in the banner displayed when you visit our Websites from certain countries (such as the European Economic Area and the UK). Note that if you disable cookies entirely, Cloudflare’s Websites may not function properly. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you advertising on third-party sites based upon your browsing activities and interests. In addition to exercising cookie choices through our “Cookie Preferences” or “Your Privacy Choices” links, if you do not want to have cookies and similar technologies used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking
here
(or if located in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, click
here
). For more information about the cookies Cloudflare uses and your privacy choices, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Material contributed in Interactive Areas
: The Websites may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums, or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”). If you choose to participate in any of these Interactive Areas, please be aware that any information that you post in an Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others who access it. If you wish to remove your personal information from any of our Interactive Areas, please see the Section 8, below.
Customers and Administrative Users
Customer Account Information
: When you register for an account, we collect contact information. Depending on subscription level, this contact information may include your Customer name, the email address(es) of your account administrator(s), telephone number, and addresses necessary to process payment and delivery of Services. In addition, when you use the Services, we collect information about how you configure your account and the Services (e.g., firewall settings for the domains you administer). We refer to all of this information collectively as “Customer Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. Customer Account Information is required to enable your access to your Cloudflare account and Services. By providing us with any personal information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal information or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us. We also maintain logs of Administrative Users’ activity (e.g., actions taken to configure settings in Customers’ account).
Payment information
: We do not require our Customers to have payment information on file with us unless they have a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide payment and billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on which payment method you choose. For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect your card information and billing address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or personal account numbers.
Crash Reports
: When our Services encounter an unexpected error, you may be asked to submit a crash report, which may contain personal information. You will have an opportunity to review the content of the report prior to submitting the report to us.
Public DNS Resolver Users
Limited DNS query data
: We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to our 1.1.1.1 resolver.

The information processed may include but is not limited to IP addresses, traffic routing data, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to and from Customers’ websites, devices, applications, and/or networks.
The End User data that we make available to our Customers via the Service dashboard or other online interface are specifically defined as “Customer Logs”.
Registrants
Contact and domain information: We collect data such as domain name and status, contact information (such as name, organization, address, phone number and email address), name server, DNSSEC, and Form of Approval (i.e., full WHOIS capture at time of transfer into our system, including the IP address that initiated the transfer).
Network Data.
Cloudflare collects and stores Network Data, which are models, observations, reports, analyses, statistics, databases and other information created, compiled, analyzed, generated or derived by Cloudflare from server, network or traffic data generated by Cloudflare in the course of providing the Service, including information required to help Cloudflare identify, analyze, mitigate, prevent, and block malicious activities on Cloudflare’s network. Examples of Network Data include service uptime and service availability metrics, request volumes, error rates, cache rates, origin and nature of malware, and IP threat scores.

. We use information we collect from 1.1.1.1 resolver users to operate and improve the 1.1.1.1 resolver, such as to assist us in our debugging efforts if an issue arises. Our 1.1.1.1 resolver service does not store 1.1.1.1 resolver users’ personal information. We will not combine any information collected from DNS queries to our 1.1.1.1 resolver with any other Cloudflare or third party data in any way that can be used to identify individual end users. Cloudflare may store aggregated data, as outlined within our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitments to privacy, indefinitely in order to power Cloudflare Radar and assist Cloudflare in improving Cloudflare services, such as, enhancing the overall performance of the Cloudflare Resolver and identifying security threats. Learn more about our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitment to privacy

.
Information from Third Party Services
. We may combine information we collect as described in Section 2 above with personal information we obtain from third parties. For example, we may combine information entered on a Cloudflare sales submission form with information we receive from a third-party sales intelligence platform vendor to enhance our ability to market our Services to Customers or potential Customers.
4. DATA AGGREGATION
Cloudflare may aggregate data we acquire about our Customers, Administrators, and End Users. For example, we may assemble data to determine how Web crawlers index the Internet and whether they are engaged in malicious activity or to compile web traffic reports and statistics. Non-personally identifiable, aggregated data may be shared with third parties.
5. INFORMATION SHARING
We work with other companies who provide us with services that help run our business and the Cloudflare Service (“Service Providers”). These companies provide services to help us deliver customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact our existing Customers and Administrators as well as sales leads, provide marketing support, and otherwise operate and improve our Services. These Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to our instructions and in compliance both with this Privacy Policy, the contracts we have in place with such Service Providers, and other applicable confidentiality, data protection, and security measures and regulations.
Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to sell any personal information we share with them or to use any personal information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to us.
In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above, we also may share your information with others in the following circumstances:
Within the Cloudflare Group (defined for the purposes of this Policy as Cloudflare, Inc. (United States) and its subsidiaries listed Section 15);
With our resellers and other sales partners who may help us distribute the Services to Customers;
With an app developer when you install an app from our App Marketplace;
In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business;

Where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Website Terms of Use, Self-Serve Subscription Agreement, and/or Enterprise Subscription Terms of Service; or as otherwise required to comply with our legal obligations; or
As you may otherwise consent from time to time.

If you purchase a domain name from Cloudflare’s registrar service, ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and the relevant registry operators overseeing the domain’s top-level domain require us to collect registrant data for the purposes of domain registration and via the WHOIS protocol. We may also be required to share this public data with ICANN, the relevant registry operators and other such providers with whom we contract in order to provide our domain name services, and additionally upon the legitimate request of third parties. Registrant data may include the domain name, registrant name and other contact information, and domain name server information. See our Domain Registration Agreement

6. NOTICE TO EU, UK, AND SWISS RESIDENTS
“Personal information” as referenced in this Privacy Policy means “personal data” as that term is defined under the European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) and its United Kingdom (“UK”) GDPR counterpart. Cloudflare is a data controller for the personal information collected from all categories of data subjects listed above, with the following exceptions: Cloudflare is a data processor of Customer Logs, Administrative User logs, and some account settings information. In addition, Cloudflare is a data processor for any of the content provided by Customers and End Users through the Services that transits, or in some cases, is stored on, the Cloudflare network. Where Cloudflare is a data processor, Cloudflare processes data on behalf of its Customers pursuant to their data processing instructions.
If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the UK or Switzerland, please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We normally will collect personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Cloudflare Services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our legitimate interests. Please note that in most cases, if you do not provide the requested information, Cloudflare will not be able to provide the requested service to you.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object by emailing us at sar@cloudflare.com.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
7. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS
Cloudflare is a U.S. based, global company. We primarily store your information in the United States and the European Economic Area. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.
Whenever a Cloudflare company transfers personal information originating from one country to another Cloudflare group company or a third party service provider or partner in a different country, we will implement appropriate safeguards, consistent with the laws of the territory from which the data is exported. We describe the safeguards we implement
here
. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK) to the United States, we rely on our certifications under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Should these certifications lapse or become otherwise invalidated, Cloudflare relies on the standard contractual clauses, including supplementary measures as necessary for transfers to the United States. We also use standard contractual clauses for other international transfers from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.
Self-certification to the Data Privacy Framework
Cloudflare complies with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Cloudflare has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Cloudflare has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF (together, the “DPFs”), Cloudflare commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPFs should first contact us by emailing sar@cloudflare.com or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.
In compliance with the DPFs, Cloudflare commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the DPFs to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of TRUSTe, LLC are provided at no cost to you. You have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other mechanisms set out in this DPF Notice or our Privacy Notice.  For more information, please see Annex 1 of the DPF Principles, available
here
.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Cloudflare’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). We may be required to disclose personal information we receive under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Cloudflare is liable for the processing of personal information it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Cloudflare shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Cloudflare proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
8. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES
Cloudflare  recognizes individuals’ data protection rights. You have the right to access, correct, update, port, or delete your personal information, and to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information (each of these a “Rights Request”). You may email us at sar@cloudflare.com with any Rights Request, and we will respond within thirty (30) days. Customers and Administrative Users also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at Cloudflare.com.
Please note that before we can complete your Rights Request, we will need to verify that your identity matches that of the data in which you are requesting to exercise your rights. You can expect a verification email under separate cover, to the email address associated with your personal information on file. If you are making a Rights Request on behalf of another individual as an authorized agent, we require that either (a) the data subject must verify their identity and directly confirm with Cloudflare they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the Rights Request, (b) the authorized agent must be provided power of attorney by the data subject in accordance with the law of the data subject’s jurisdiction, or (c) the Rights Request must otherwise be submitted in accordance with applicable privacy law.
For any Rights Request, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist. Where a Rights Request may implicate the personal information of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply with Rights Requests to the extent required by applicable law or the Swiss-U.S. or EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. In the event that your Rights Request is denied, residents of the U.S. states Virginia and Colorado may appeal our decision by responding to the email informing them of the denial or by submitting a Rights Request to appeal to sar@cloudflare.com, and we will respond within sixty (60) days. In the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Please note that we do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that would be subject to the Rights Requests described above. In addition, Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users. Even where “Cloudflare” may be indicated as the authoritative name server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain, we have no control over a domain’s content. Accordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for Rights Requests in accordance with their obligations under applicable data protection laws. If an End User requests that we fulfill a Rights Request, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly. Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website users.
9. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES
Cloudflare will send you commercial communications based on the communication preferences in your account settings. Cloudflare also will send you service-related communications. You may manage your receipt of commercial communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of such emails, through your account settings if you have a Cloudflare account, or you may send a request to unsubscribe@cloudflare.com.
10. DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS
We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access. We have put in place appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
11. DATA RETENTION
We store your personal information for a period of time that is consistent with the business purposes set forth in Section 3 of this policy or as long as needed to fulfill and comply with legal obligations. The criteria we used to determine how long we store your personal information will vary depending on several different factors. We typically consider the following when determining data retention:
The purpose for collecting the personal information in the first place. For example, if you have an active account with us, we need to keep your contact information during the entirety of that time in order to provide you with support or contact you regarding your account;
The volume, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information we are processing;
The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information;
Whether we can achieve the purposes for processing with less data or through other means
Legal requirements that may apply to the data, such as applicable statutes of limitation or contractual obligations.
When the data retention period expires for a given type of data, we will delete or destroy it. If, for technical reasons, we are unable to do so, we will implement appropriate security measures to prevent any further use of such data.
12. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
If we make changes to this Policy that we believe materially impact the privacy of your personal information, we will promptly provide notice of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), as well as post the updated Policy on this website noting the effective date of any changes.
13. BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS
We may assign or transfer this Policy, as well as information covered by this Policy, in the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.
14. ENGLISH LANGUAGE CONTROLS
Non-English translations of this Policy are provided for convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.
15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
If you have an unresolved privacy or data-use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
.
16. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section, “Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in the CCPA. It does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.
How We Collect, Use, and Share Your Personal Information under the CCPA
We may collect, use, and disclose for our business and commercial purposes, the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers for the categories of individuals/users defined in Section 1 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy (e.g., email address of Customers and Administrative Users, name and contact information of Attendees);
Payment and customer records information of our Customers;
Protected classification characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, race, languages spoken, or gender) to the extent these characteristics are voluntarily disclosed to us or contained in any  content transmitted across or stored on our network;
Commercial information (e.g., records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or usage histories);
Professional or employment information;
Internet or other electronic network activity information; and
Inferences (e.g., information about your interests or preferences).
The sources from which we collect information are described in Section 2 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The business and commercial purposes for which we collect and use this information are described in Section 3 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The categories of third parties to whom we “disclose” the information for a business purpose are described in Section 5 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
Your California Privacy Rights
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.
Knowledge
. You can request information about what personal information we have collected about you, including:
the categories of personal information;
the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information;
the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.
Access
. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you.
Deletion
. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.
Correction
. You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal information and, taking into account the purpose of processing the personal information, ensure it is complete;
Opt-out of sales or sharing
. You can ask that we do not “sell” or “share” your Personal Information as “sell” and “share” are explicitly defined under the CCPA. For more information, please refer to the section titled “Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information” below.
Nondiscrimination
. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you the Services; increasing the price/rate of the Services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.
In order to submit a request to exercise your right of information, access, or deletion pursuant to the CCPA, please follow the instructions for the submitting a Rights Request detailed in Section 8, above. Please note, we reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and may need to confirm your identity to process certain requests using the verification methods described in Section 8. For example, we take reasonable precautions to verify the identities of those California residents submitting requests to delete or access Personal Information.
Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information
Cloudflare does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use. Making Personal Information (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information under the CCPA.
You can request to opt out of such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information using the “
Your Privacy Choices”
link in the footer below
.
In addition, some internet browsers offer the option to enable opt-out signals such as Global Privacy Control that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Cloudflare responds to these signals by processing them as a request to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information as discussed above.
Please note that you will still see some advertising, regardless of your selection. We do not impose verification protocols for processing opt out requests unless we have reason to question the authenticity of a requester’s identity, in which case we may request evidence of identity and California residency.

Purpose of Data Collection
Cloudflare empowers organizations to make their employees, applications, and networks faster and more secure everywhere, while reducing complexity and cost. Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud delivers the most full-featured, unified platform of cloud-native products and developer tools, so any organization can gain the control they need to work, develop, and accelerate their business. Cloudflare uses data to manage our relationships with our customers and provide our services. For example, Cloudflare collects contact information and billing information to facilitate transactions with our customers. In connection with our customer's use of the services, Cloudflare processes information to provide, operate, maintain, improve, promote, and enable access and use of our websites and services. We may share such data with third parties who provide us with billing, marketing, account management tools, and other product support that enable us to provide services to our customers. Data from visitors to our customers' networks or Internet properties is processed as part of the Internet traffic logs we process on behalf of our customers (e.g., network interaction data) and may also be processed if our customers include such information in the data they insert into our network. In addition, Cloudflare may use data from event attendees, website visitors, registrants, as well as Customer Account Information for internal marketing or user experience purposes and to analyze usage trends and activities in connection with our services. 

Cloudflare also processes employee data to facilitate a working relationship with our employees. Such data may include identification information, banking information, medical or benefits election information, performance management information, and strategy and planning data. In order to maintain a global workforce, Cloudflare transfers employment data internationally via our globally distributed HR Team. Cloudflare may share this data with approved third party service providers who support our workforce management efforts, such as to provide payroll and benefits to our employees.

Candidate Privacy Notice
Last Updated: 12/15/2023
When you apply to work with any of the Cloudflare Group of companies (Cloudflare, Inc.
and its wholly owned subsidiaries as listed in our
Privacy Policy
(together, “Cloudflare” or
“we”), we will collect the personal data contained in your application. In this case, we are
a "data controller.” This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use
personal data about you.
This notice provides applicants (whether for an employee, worker or contractor position)
with information about the personal data we collect, how and why your personal data will
be used, and how long we will retain it. It also provides you with certain information that
we are required to provide you under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Applicable Data
Protection Laws means all data protection laws and regulations of the jurisdictions of the
aforenamed Cloudflare companies that are applicable to the processing of personal data.
Your personal data will be processed for the purposes of managing our recruitment and
hiring-related activities, which include setting up and conducting interviews and tests for
applicants, evaluating and assessing the results thereto, conducting reference and/or
background checks, and as is otherwise needed in the recruitment and hiring processes.
We process your information as necessary for our legitimate interests (that is, the
solicitation, evaluation, and selection of applicants for employment) or where we have
your consent to do so.
1. DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES
We will comply with data protection laws and principles, which means that your data will
be:
Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.
Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes.
Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes.
Accurate and kept up to date.
Retained only as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.
Kept securely.
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
In connection with your application for work with us, we will collect your personal data
from you, from recruitment agencies (who may provide us with information such as CVs,
and your named references. We gather, store, and use the following categories of
personal data about you:
The information you have provided to us in your resume, curriculum vitae, and/or cover letter.
The information you have provided on our application form, including but not limited to name, title, address, telephone number, personal email address, date of birth, gender, employment history, and qualifications.
Any information you provide to us during an interview.
Test results (if applicable to the role) and work sample.
Any information your references provide to us during a reference check.
In some cases, we may perform a background and/or credit check. When we do that, we
may collect the following categories of information from a background check provider:
name, title, address, telephone number, personal email address, date of birth, employment history, national ID, references, education. Section 4, below, provides more information about the "special categories" of Sensitive Personal Information we may collect, store, and use.
3. HOW WE WILL USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
We will use the above-described categories of personal data we collect about you to:
Assess your skills, qualifications, and suitability for the work.
Carry out background and reference checks as appropriate and in accordance with applicable law.
Communicate with you about the recruitment process.
Keep records related to our hiring processes.
Comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
It is in our legitimate interest to decide whether to appoint you to a role as it would be
beneficial to our business to appoint someone to that role. We also need to process your
personal data to decide whether to enter into a contract of employment or contract for
services with you. We may use your information to re-engage with you for future
employment opportunities.
4. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA
If you fail to provide information when requested, and that information is necessary for
us to consider your application (such as evidence of qualifications or work history), we
will not be able to process your application successfully. For example, if we require a
credit check or references for this role and you fail to provide us with relevant details, we
will not be able to take your application further
5. SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT, AND HOW WE USE IT
We may collect the following "special categories" of more sensitive personal data:
information about your race or ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation and political
opinions, if you choose to give us that information (“Sensitive Personal Information”). We
will hold this information for the purposes of legal compliance, diversity and equal
opportunities. We will use Sensitive Personal Information in the following ways:
We will use information about your disability status to consider whether we need to provide appropriate adjustments during the recruitment process, for example whether adjustments need to be made during a test or interview.
We will use information about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or moral beliefs, or your sexual life or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equal opportunity monitoring and reporting.
In addition, we will collect, store, and use information about your criminal convictions
history if we perform a background check. Typically, we perform background and/or
credit checks if we would like to offer you the role. Such an offer is usually conditional on
checks and any other conditions, such as references, being satisfactory. We are entitled
to ask you to apply for a basic criminal record check in order to satisfy ourselves that
there is nothing in your criminal convictions history which makes you unsuitable for the
role. Every role at Cloudflare requires a high degree of trust and integrity and therefore
requires a criminal background check. Such background checks are conducted in
accordance with applicable law.
We have in place an appropriate policy document and safeguards which we are required
by law to maintain when processing such data.
6. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based
solely on automated decision-making.
7. HOW WE MAY SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES
We share the above-described personal data with third-party service providers, including other entities in the Cloudflare Group for business purposes. These service providers help us manage our recruiting and hiring processes, communicate with applicants, schedule interviews, and, when appropriate, conduct background checks. The service providers we use include:

CrossHCQ
, a cloud services provider located in the United States of America and engaged by Cloudflare to help facilitate the recruitment process on Cloudflare’s behalf.

All of our third-party service providers and other entities in the Cloudflare Group (Cloudflare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries) are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal data in line with our policies. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes or to sell your personal data. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
Cloudflare will not “sell” candidate personal information or “share” candidate personal information for the purposes of conducting behavioral or targeted advertising, as “sell” and “share” are defined under Applicable Data Protection Law.
Cloudflare is a U.S. based, global company. When you submit your personal data to any Cloudflare entity outside the United States, we transfer your personal data and special categories of personal data to countries where the Cloudflare Group
has offices in the legitimate interests of the Company and/or with your consent. The Cloudflare Group offices are listed here: https://www.cloudflare.com/about-overview/.
We recognise that the EU has established strict positions regarding the handling of personal data (including special categories of personal data, as appropriate) including requirements to provide adequate protection for personal data collected within the EEA and transferred outside the EEA. We will ensure that we only transfer personal data (including special categories of personal data, as appropriate) to a country or territory outside the EEA if that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of individuals in relation to the processing of personal data (including sensitive personal data, as appropriate) or where adequate contractual or other safeguards to protect that data are in place.
Whenever a Cloudflare company transfers personal information originating from one country to another Cloudflare group company or a third party service provider or partner in a different country, we will implement appropriate safeguards, consistent with the laws of the territory from which the data is exported. We describe the safeguards we implement here. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK) to the United States, we rely on our certifications under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Should these certifications lapse or become otherwise invalidated, Cloudflare relies on the standard contractual clauses, including supplementary measures as necessary for transfers to the United States. We also use standard contractual clauses for other international transfers from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.
Self-certification to the Data Privacy Framework
Cloudflare complies with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Cloudflare has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Cloudflare has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF (together, the “DPFs”), Cloudflare commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPFs should first contact us by emailing sar@cloudflare.com or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.
In compliance with the DPFs, Cloudflare commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the DPFs to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request for more information or to file a complaint. The services of TRUSTe, LLC are provided at no cost to you. You have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other mechanisms set out in this DPF Notice or our Privacy Notice. For more information, please see Annex 1 of the DPF Principles, available here.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Cloudflare’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). We may be required to disclose personal information we receive under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Cloudflare is liable for the processing of personal information it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Cloudflare shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Cloudflare proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
8. HOW WE SECURE YOUR DATA
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from
being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In
addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors,
and other third parties who have a business need-to-know. They will only process your
personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Details of these measures may be obtained from
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and
will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally
required to do so.
9. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION
We will retain your personal data for a period of up to 3 years after we have communicated to you our decision about whether to appoint you to a role. We retain your personal data for that period so that we can show, in the event of a legal claim, that we have not discriminated against candidates on prohibited grounds and that we have conducted the recruitment exercise in a fair and transparent way. After this period, we will securely destroy your personal data in accordance with internal policies and procedures.
10. YOUR RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. If you are a California resident, you can also request the following:
1. categories of personal information,
2. the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected,
3. the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information,
4. the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information, and
5. the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Request the limitation or restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it. If you are a resident of California, you may have the right to limit some uses of your Sensitive Personal Information.
Request the transfer
of your personal data to another party.
Non-discrimination
for exercising your privacy rights.
If you want to make a request with respect of your rights relating to your personal data, please send your request to
sar@cloudflare.com
in writing.
Please note, that we may be required to ask you for further information in order to confirm your identity before we provide the information requested. Specifically, we may send a separate email to verify your email address on file. We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible. Should we not be able to respond to your request within thirty (30) days after receiving your request, we will inform you in writing within thirty (30) days of the time by which we will be able to respond to your request. If we are unable to provide you with any personal data, make a correction or delete personal data requested by you, we shall generally inform you of the reasons why we are unable to do so (except where we are not required to do so under Applicable Data Protection Laws).
California residents also have the right to designate an authorized agent to make a
request on their behalf. If you would like an authorized agent to submit a request on your
behalf, we require that either (a) you must directly confirm with us that you provided the
authorized agent permission to submit the request, (b) you must provide the authorized
agent with your power of attorney in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which
you are located, or (c) the request must otherwise be submitted in accordance with
Applicable Laws.
You also have the right to object to our processing of your data where we are processing
such data in our legitimate interests or to withdraw your consent for processing where
our processing is based on having received your consent. To object or withdraw your
consent, please contact us at
sar@cloudflare.com

privacy notice. If you have any questions about this privacy notice or how we handle
