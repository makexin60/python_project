This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and MoneyLion may share this aggregated data with MoneyLion Related Companies, and with its agents, service providers, marketplace partners, and other third parties with whom we do business.  This includes, but is not limited to, information such as consumer financial trends, choices, and comparisons. We may also use aggregated information from these sources to create similar audiences in order to better target advertisements on third-party advertising and social media networks to potential consumers who appear to have shared characteristics. MoneyLion may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective marketplace partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. This aggregated information does not identify you personally. We will not attempt to re-identify the data once in aggregated or non-personally identifiable form.
HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may disclose your Personal Information to the following categories of recipients for our business or commercial purposes:
A) MONEYLION RELATED COMPANIES:
We may disclose your Personal Information to MoneyLion Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy (including for marketing and advertising purposes).
B) THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS:
MoneyLion, like many businesses, hires other companies and contractors to provide certain business-related services (for example, verifying your identity, facilitating mailings, maintaining databases, providing customer service, cloud storage providers, and business analytics and marketing providers). We
may also disclose this information to consumer reporting agencies, acting in a service provider capacity, as part of data studies intended to test the reliability of our internal data and to improve the quality of our Services. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, and we ensure that we have appropriate contractual provisions in place to protect your Personal Information.
C) BUSINESS PARTNERS:
When we partner with other businesses to provide content, products, or services to you or to such business partners, we may disclose relevant Personal Information in connection with such content, products, or services. For example, when you enable our Driver Score feature, your location information is disclosed to Zendrive, our automobile insurance partner, in order to track your driving habits to seek out automobile insurance discounts and savings. Or, when you use our “Products and Services” offering to search for financial products or services from our marketplace partners, we will disclose the information you provide when using these services to marketplace partners whose pre-qualification criteria you may satisfy. In addition, we may provide summarized purchase information, on an aggregated and anonymized basis, to marketplace partners in order to support the accuracy of their financial and business analytics. We may also share this information with marketplace partners to improve efforts to target appropriate advertising content to you.
D) CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES:
We may disclose basic Personal Information to consumer reporting agencies, either for purposes of completing a “soft” credit inquiry with your authorization, or as part of data studies, with the consumer reporting agencies acting in a service provider capacity, which are intended to test the reliability of our internal data and improve the quality of our Services.
E) POTENTIAL PARTIES TO A CORPORATE TRANSACTION (AND THEIR AGENTS AND ADVISORS):
We may disclose your Personal Information to actual or potential buyers (and their agents and advisors) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger, acquisition, reorganization, financing, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider.

When we are no longer required to retain the Personal Information as described above, we will destroy, erase, or de-identify it.

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by MoneyLion (the “
Third-Party Sites

SECURITY:
We take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards (which vary depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information) designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure or access to Personal Information, and we regularly adapt these controls to respond to changing requirements and advances in technology.
However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. If you are, or believe you have become, a victim of identity theft, you may visit the website of the Federal Trade Commission at
https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/
for free information to help guard against identity theft and guidance on the recovery steps you can take.

Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE:
From time to time, we may offer the opportunity to enter Promotions subject to program-specific rules. Because you would be required to provide personal information (typically contact information) to opt into these Promotions and receive the opportunity to earn rewards, these offers may be considered “financial incentives” under applicable law.
You may opt into Promotions by submitting an entry form. You have the right to withdraw from a Promotion at any time by contacting us at
optout@moneylion.com
, and you may opt out of marketing emails at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located in the footer of the emails you receive.
We offer Promotions because the value of the personal information we collect through program entries is reasonably related to the value of the prizes and rewards offered. This value is based on the expense of running the Promotions, along with other factors, such as whether you sign up for our products or services and whether we are able to use the data we collect from you.

Your personal financial situation is unique, and it is your responsibility to evaluate the information and content provided, before making any financial decisions.
‍
We support the principles of the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the “ECOA”). We do not engage in business practices that discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program, or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
‍
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) Disclosure:
The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the rate at which your loan accrues interest. It is based upon the amount of your loan, the cost of the loan, term of the loan, repayment amounts and timing of payments and payoff. By law, the lender or lending partner must show you the APR before you enter into the loan. States have laws that may limit the APR that the lender or lending partner can charge you. Rates will vary based on your credit worthiness, loan size, amongst other variables, with the lowest rates available to customers with excellent credit. Minimum and maximum loan amounts and APRs may vary according to state law and lender or lending partner. We recommend that you read the lender's and/or lending partner's personal terms and conditions in full before proceeding for any loan.
‍
Representative Example
: If you borrow $5,000 with a 36 month repayment term, and a 10% APR, the monthly payment amount will be $161.34. Total repayment will be $5,808.24. Total interest paid will be $808.24.
‍
Representative Example (Credit Cards)
: If you have a $5,000 balance remaining at a 15% APR. Your end of day balance would be $5,000 after the first day., Assuming no purchases or payments, your balance at the end of the second day would be $5000, plus $2.05 in interest that accrued on the previous day’s balance ($5000*(0.15/365)). This would repeat every day until the end of the billing period. If there are no fees or other charges monthly repayment may be $5,061.50.

PRODUCT SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES
Mortgage Products Including Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC) & Home Equity Loans
See our licensing page for additional mortgage product licensing information and state specific disclosures.
Any information you provide to Engine by MoneyLion pursuant to a request for mortgage product offers may be shared with the Financial Institution Providers on our platform in furtherance of your request.These Financial Institution Providers may retain your information provided to them by Engine by MoneyLion regardless of whether or not you obtain a loan from them.
The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Act, requires Financial Institution Providers to include a Good Faith Estimate (GFE), also referred to as a Loan Estimate Form, with any firm offers of credit they extend to you pursuant to an application you submit directly to that provider. This document sets forth the various loan terms and costs involved, such as a credit report fee, property appraisal fee, or other third-party fees in connection with your loan.
The interest rate reflected in any offers presented to you are subject to change without notice, unless and until you and the Financial Institution Provider have entered into an interest rate lock-in agreement.. The refundability of any fees associated with an interest rate lock-in agreement will be set forth in the terms and conditions of that agreement.
If your home value is higher than your outstanding mortgage balance(s), you may be able to borrow against the portion of equity available in your home. Under the ECOA, you are entitled to receive a copy of any appraisal.
A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is a line of credit that is secured by your home. Some HELOC products offered on Engine by MoneyLion’s platform have variable interest rates. These variable interest rates may go up or down in relation to an index, economic conditions, and/or the terms of the loan agreement. Some HELOC products may be subject to interest rate adjustment caps that limit the range of fluctuation of your interest rate for a set period (i.e. 6 months or 1 year) and for the life of the loan. Example: A Variable Rate HELOC with interest rate caps of 2% for the first year and 1% each year afterward for the life of the loan.
‍
HELOC
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) Disclosure:
Rates and terms may change at any time and will be subject to property type, loan amount, credit history, lien position, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, FICO score and draw amount at closing. Rates are subject to change daily and minimum line amounts may apply. All accounts are subject to individual lender approval. Any minimum periodic payments stated by a lender may result in a balloon payment if only the minimum is made. The amount and timing of the balloon payment is at the discretion of the lender. Please evaluate all terms prior to making any financial decision.
‍
HELOC Representative Example
Home value $300,000
$300,000 x 80% = $240,000.
You owe $100,000 on your first mortgage: $240,000 – $100,000 = $140,000. In the above scenario, assuming your lender caps the maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%, you could potentially qualify for a HELOC with a maximum credit line of $140,000.”
‍
Other helpful information can be found at: HELOC Brochure "What you should know about home equity lines of credit"
‍
Banking Products Including Checking & Savings Accounts
Minimum balance, minimum opening deposit, and/or other funding requirements may apply in order to open an account or earn the stated Annual Percentage Yield (APY). All accounts are subject to approval by the Financial Institution Provider. Accounts with variable rates are identified as such in the offers from Financial Institution Providers.
Annual Percentage Yield (APY) reflects the total amount of interest paid on an account, based on the interest rate and the frequency of compounding for a 365-day period, expressed as a percentage. This differs from the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) which does not include compounding interest. APY is subject to change before and after account opening.
‍
Types of Banking Products Offered on the Engine by MoneyLion Platform
-
Money Market Accounts (MMA)
are sometimes called money market deposit accounts or money market savings accounts. MMAs restrict withdrawals and payments to 6 times per month when using a check, debit card, draft, or electronic transfer. Withdrawals or payments by ATM, in person, by mail, messenger, or telephone check do not count against the 6 transactions per month limit.
- Cash Management Accounts (CMA)
are cash accounts that combine services and features similar to those offered by traditional checking, savings, and investment accounts into one financial product. CMAs are offered by non-banking Financial Institution Providers such as brokerage firms.
- High Interest Checking Accounts (HIC)
offers a higher interest rate (annual percentage yield, or APY) on money held in that account compared to other types of checking accounts.
- Certificate of Deposit (CD)
is a type of savings account that earns interest on deposited funds for a fixed period of time ending with the “maturity date.” If funds are withdrawn prior to the maturity date penalties may be applied, including loss of interest.
‍
Private Student Loans and Student Loan Refinance
Refinancing your federal student loan may result in the loss of certain benefits, and/or eligibility that apply to federal student loans. In addition, refinancing your student loan(s) may result in penalties, restrictions, or changes in your payment amount and terms. Refinancing your student loan(s) may not result in lower payments and in many cases can extend the life of the loan. Requirements, discounts, or other terms and conditions will vary by lender.
You may also qualify for federal student financial assistance. Visit
https://studentaid.gov
for more information.
‍
Auto Loan and Auto Loan Refinancing
Any offers you receive for auto loans or auto loan refinancing on Engine by MoneyLion’s platform do not include all costs that may be associated with an auto loan such as taxes, licensing, and fees. Other factors such as down payment, trade-in, rebates, and type of
automobile may impact the actual terms of the loan. Minimum and/or maximum loan amounts may be applied by the Financial Institution Provider based on several factors such as your income, credit history, and the vehicle you are purchasing or refinancing. Restrictions as to the type and age of vehicle you are purchasing or refinancing, as well as other characteristics may also apply. Refinancing your auto loan may not always result in lower payments and in many cases it can extend the life of the loan.
Auto Loans or Auto Refinance Loans are a type of secured loan. This means the vehicle financed by the loan will be used as collateral to satisfy the loan in the event you become unable to pay according to the terms of the loan. In some cases, the Financial Institution Provider may hold a lien on the collateral until the loan is fully repaid.

This Notice serves as a disclosure statement, notice, contract, and/or agreement, as required by the laws of the corresponding state listed below. This Notice also identifies the nature of our relationship with you, describes the services we provide and duties we owe to you, and explains how we will be compensated.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE AND RETAIN A COPY OF IT FOR YOUR RECORDS. Your use of our services constitutes your signed acknowledgement that you have received, read, understood, consented, and agreed to the terms of this Notice. However, accepting the terms of this Notice does not obligate you to obtain a mortgage loan through us, nor does it constitute mortgage loan approval. You further acknowledge that you are entitled to a copy of this Notice and agree to retain a copy for your records.
I. Nature of Relationship
We operate an online platform that provides a loan matching service and offers information about loans and other financial products and services to consumers. We are not a lender or correspondent lender. We do not make mortgage loans or commitments or take applications and cannot guarantee acceptance into any particular loan program by any Lender, or specific loan terms or conditions. We are an independent contractor and do not act as an agent or advisor to you or any financial service provider. We enter into mortgage loan brokerage contracts with consumers only to the extent required by state law. Any loan may be co-brokered but not in South Carolina. This Notice does not create an exclusive relationship and remains in effect only as long as you seek to use our services. You may discontinue this relationship at any time, without notice, at no cost or penalty to you.
II. Services and Duties
In order to operate our online platform and loan matching service in compliance with law, we are required to be licensed in some states as a mortgage loan broker and/or mortgage loan originator. However, we do not act as a lender or credit provider. We do not take applications, make loans or credit decisions in connection with loans, issue commitments or lock-in agreements, or fund loans. Our services are purely administrative. You are not required to use our computerized loan matching services in order to obtain a residential mortgage loan.
We will perform the following services for you: (1) make loan request forms available to you; (2) transmit your completed loan request to participating lenders in our network; (3) offer you access to general educational information concerning home financing including glossaries, articles, and calculators; and (4) send you the initial loan offers from lenders responding to your loan request.
Any loan request you submit is NOT an application for credit. Rather, it is a request to be matched with prospective third-party lenders to receive conditional loan offers from those lenders. Any lender will require you to submit a loan application to them for their consideration before extending an offer. One or more lenders may provide you with their loan product offers.
We do not issue loan approvals, loan commitments, or make any guarantees on behalf of any lender. We do not connect you with every lender in the market, so other lenders and loans not listed on our service may be available to you, and those other loans may have different terms and conditions, including lower rates. We cannot guarantee the lowest price or best terms available in the market. We do not endorse or recommend particular lenders or products. Your personal financial situation is unique, and it is your responsibility to evaluate the information and content provided, before making any financial decisions. You should rely on your own judgment in deciding which available loan product, terms, and lender best suits your needs and financial means or consider obtaining additional information and/or advice from a qualified financial advisor who is fully aware of your individual circumstances.
The lenders are solely responsible for their services to you, and you agree that we will not be liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your use of such services. You understand that lenders may keep your loan request information and any other information provided by us or received by them in the processing of your loan request, whether or not you are qualified for a loan with them or obtain a loan from them. You agree to notify any particular lender directly if you no longer want to receive communications.
III. Compensation and Fees
We provide our services at no cost to you and will not charge or seek fees of any kind from you. We may, however, receive compensation from lenders in different amounts for different products or services, ranging from $1.00 TO $1,000,000.00 and may be paid based on the goods, facilities, or services performed or provided by us to lenders. We will be compensated in compliance with Section 1026.36(d) of Regulation Z (12 CFR 1026.36(d)) (as applicable). The lenders or other service providers may charge you fees in connection with the loans or other products they offer. The amount of any fee will be determined by the lender.
If your loan request is forwarded to a prospective lender that makes you an offer, you should receive from the lender a disclosure, sometimes referred to as a good faith estimate (GFE) of the settlement costs of your loan, and now generally referred to as a Loan Estimate form as required by the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Act. The disclosure sets forth the various loan terms and costs involved, such as a credit report fee, property appraisal fee, or other third-party fees in connection with your loan.
The interest rate quoted in connection with the loan you select is subject to change without notice, unless and until an interest rate lock-in agreement has been entered into between you and the lender. We do not offer interest rate lock-in agreements and do not guarantee any interest rate quoted by a participating lender. If you enter a lock-in agreement with the lender and are required to pay an interest rate lock-in fee, the terms and conditions under which the interest rate lock-in fee may be refunded, if any, will be set by the lender. The documentation you receive will include the information or terms and conditions on the refundability of any fees paid. We do not offer or provide any refund on behalf of any lender.
IV. Fair Lending Compliance
We support the principles of the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the “ECOA”). We do not engage in business practices that discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program, or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Similarly, we are committed to compliance with any applicable state and local anti-discrimination laws. Under the ECOA, you are entitled to receive a copy of any appraisal. The federal agency that administers our compliance with the ECOA is the Federal Trade Commission, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Washington, DC 20580. An applicant, if married, may apply for a separate account / loan.
