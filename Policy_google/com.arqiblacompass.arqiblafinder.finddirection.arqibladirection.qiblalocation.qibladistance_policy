DATE: 17/04/ 2024
Privacy Policy for Quran App(AlphaMuslim Apps)
Introduction
The Quran app ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you" or "your"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application, The AlQuran kareem App.
Information We Collect
We may collect the following information from you when you use the App:
Location Information(Optional):
We may request your location permission to allow features like finding nearby mosques or displaying prayer times specific to your location. You are not obligated to grant this permission, and the core functionality of the Quran will still be available.
Storage Permission:
We request storage permission to allow the App to download and store Quran data and other resources on your device for offline access. This allows you to use the App without an internet connection.
How We Use Your Information
Location Information (if granted):
We will only use your location information to provide features you have explicitly enabled, such as displaying nearby mosques or prayer times specific to your location.
Storage Permission:
We will only use storage permission to download and store Quran data and other resources on your device for offline access. We will not access any personal data stored on your device besides the Quran data downloaded through the App.
Sharing Your Information
We will not share your information with any third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. We may share your information with third-party service providers who help us operate the App, such as cloud storage providers for Quran data. These service providers will only be given access to the information necessary to perform their services and will be contractually obligated to keep your information confidential.
Your Choices
Location Permission:
You can choose to deny or grant location permission when you first use the App and can change this permission in your device settings at any time.
Storage Permission:
You can choose to deny storage permission when you first use the App. However, this will limit the App's functionality, as offline access will not be available. You can manage storage permission in your device settings.
Security
We use appropriate security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or electronic storage system is 100% secure.
Children's Privacy
Our App is intended for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. We will take steps to delete the information from our servers.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the App.
