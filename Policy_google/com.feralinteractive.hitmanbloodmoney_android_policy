Privacy policy for Feral games
Unless required to do so by law, or in order for a game to function correctly, Feral Interactive holds all communications between it and its customers in confidence. Feral does not disclose any customer information to other parties. If you have any questions please
contact Feral
.
What information does Feral receive?
Feral receives various types of information, including hardware specification, software versions and usage data. This is not used to identify individuals. However, for some services it also collects personal details such as email addresses and usernames where these are integral to the service it provides.
Purchasing and Game Activation
Games that are bought from the Feral Store will be in the form of a Steam activation key. Feral Interactive will hold a record of the purchase details, including customer name, billing address and email address. The activation of Steam keys is processed by Valve via their Steam Client.
Games that are downloaded from the App Store (iOS games), the Mac App Store (macOS games), Steam (macOS, Linux or Windows games), Google Play (Android games), Nintendo eShop (Nintendo Switch games), Epic Games Store (macOS games), and the Meta Quest Store (Meta Quest games) use systems that are managed by Apple, Valve, Google, Nintendo, Epic and Meta respectively. Please check their privacy policies for how your data is handled.
Game Updates
From time to time the documentation and default settings of Feral games are updated. In order to do this, your device periodically checks with the Feral servers to make sure its data is current. This process collects non-personal information only, such as the type of device being used, the version of the operating system being used, the game title and its version number. This data is used to help Feral maintain a good user-experience.
Support
When you send a support request to Feral, the support team may ask for more information about your system.
For macOS, Linux and Windows games, this information is gathered in a
support report
, which contains details of your computer’s hardware and software.
For iOS, Android and Meta Quest games, the in-app functionality to email the Feral support team will automatically populate the email with information about your device and its operating system, as well as your user preferences and saved games. None of this information is used to identify you as an individual.
Feral keeps a record of all support requests, but does not use the information they contain for any purpose other than to identify problems and resolve support issues. Any attachments sent to the Feral support team via email are automatically deleted 10 days after the issue is resolved.
Crash Reports
If a macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android, Switch or Meta Quest game crashes, a report is automatically created by the operating system. On all platforms other than Switch, the next time the game is launched you will be given the option of sending the crash report to Feral; this may help to diagnose the issue that caused the crash. A crash report only contains information about the device being used and the crash itself; it does not contain any personal information, but you will be given the option to include an email address when you send the report.
iOS and Android games also offer the option to send an email containing a crash log the next time a game launches after a crash. If taken, an email will be sent to the Feral Support team from the user’s email account. Your email address will only be used by the support team to contact you about the crash, and will not be used for any other purpose.
Feral / Calico Accounts and Online Features
In order to access certain online features, some games require you to log in to a Calico account, which is the Feral Interactive client for online play. By default, your account data is kept private; however, some items such as your username are publicly viewable.
In order to create a Calico Account, you will need to provide your name, email address and date of birth. Feral does not disclose this information to anyone other than its trusted partners in order for them to provide their services. For example, if you create a Feral Account in order to access online modes in Company of Heroes 2, your details will be available to Relic Entertainment, who manage the servers that run the game’s online modes.
While you are logged into Calico, the game will periodically communicate with Feral’s servers, including whenever you start up or shut down a game. Feral records this data to help address specific technical issues and to better understand how our games are played.
Steam games on macOS, Linux and Windows use Valve’s services to enable certain online features. Feral Interactive is not responsible for any data usage by these services; for more information please check
Steam’s Terms of Service and Privacy policies
.
Anonymous Usage Analytics
While connected to the internet, Feral  games will communicate periodically with its servers, including whenever you start up or shut down a game. This data (known as “analytics”) is recorded to help address specific technical issues and to better understand how the games are played. None of this information is used to identify you as an individual.
Deletion of Personal Data
If you have interacted with a Feral service using user-identifiable data, for example registering for Calico with your real name, or contacting Feral’s Support team using your name and a user-identifiable email address, then you can
contact Support
to request that this data is deleted.
Changes to This Policy
This privacy policy may be modified from time to time.
