Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy outlines how Arrow of Time, LLC (hereinafter referred to as "Provider") collects, uses, and protects your data through the Arrow of Progress application (hereinafter referred to as "Application"). Our commitment is to your privacy and data protection.
This privacy policy is applicable to the Application for mobile devices, which was developed by the Provider as a Commercial service. This service is provided "AS IS.”
Automatically Collected Information
The Application collects anonymized information, automatically through Unity Analytics, a 3rd party analytics plugin made for the Unity engine (which this game is built on). This includes, but is not limited to, gameplay statistics, app usage patterns, and device type. The Provider views general activity and progress data across all users. No individual data is tracked by the Provider. The user can opt out, opt in, and delete all related server data from within the application settings at any time.
Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?
This Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.
Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?
Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted and saved to external services to aid the Provider in improving the Application and their service.
Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:
*
Google Play Services
*
Unity
The Provider may disclose Automatically Collected Information:
* As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
* When they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
* With their trusted services providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.
What are my opt-out rights?
You can halt all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application or opting out within the settings menu of the Application. No user data will be collected before being shown an opt-in screen.
Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information
The Provider will retain automatically collected information for up to 24 months and thereafter may store it in aggregate.
Data Deletion and Anonymization
Our Application is designed with your privacy in mind. As part of our commitment to protecting your privacy, we collect information in a way that does not directly identify you. This means that once the information is collected and anonymized, it becomes impossible for us to identify the data pertaining to any specific individual. As such, our data collection and analysis are based on anonymized data sets. Also, all data can be deleted from the Application settings menu at any time.
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
We recognize the rights of individuals under the GDPR, including the right to erasure (“the right to be forgotten”). However, the GDPR applies these rights to identifiable data. Since our Application processes data in an anonymized form that does not allow us or anyone to trace data back to an individual, these rights do not apply to the anonymized data collected and processed by our Application. Should you choose to stop using our Application, any data previously collected and anonymized cannot be individually assessed or deleted, except by the user themselves through the Application, as it does not constitute personally identifiable information under the GDPR.
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
Similarly, the CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This includes the right to request the deletion of personal information. However, because our Application only processes anonymized data that cannot be linked back to any individual, these rights do not apply to the information processed by our Application. The anonymized data is beyond the scope of information that can be requested for deletion under the CCPA, as it cannot be associated with any consumer or household. However the user themselves can delete all data from within the Application settings menu.
Our Commitment
Please be assured that our use of anonymized data is aimed at improving user experience and enhancing our Application without compromising individual privacy. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and will continue to monitor and adjust our practices in line with legal requirements and best practices.
If you have any questions or concerns about our data practices, please contact us at [contact information].
Children Under 13
The Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.
The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case the Provider discovers that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Provider will immediately delete this from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact the Provider (contact@arrowofprogress.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.
Security
The Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve their Application. Please be aware that, although we provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-03-25
Your Consent
By using the Application, you are giving your consent to the Provider processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing,” means using cookies on a computer/hand held device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information.
Contact us
If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Provider via email at contact@arrowofprogress.com.
