Categories   of recipients
Reason for data sharing

These companies include providers of management services, hosting services, email correspondence, cloud services, database management, advertising services such as Microsoft Azure, OpenAI, StatSig, Mixpanel, Meta, Tik Tok, Google Ads, Tag Manager, Google Analytics, The Marketer, Google Cloud Platform, Twilio etc.).

DATA SECURITY
We have implemented at least reasonable and appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect and to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure and misuse of your Personal Information, such as encryption.

If you access third-party services, such as social media sites or other sites linked through the Services (e.g., if you follow a link to our Instagram account), these third-party services will be able to collect Personal Information about you, including information about your activity on the Services. If we link  a site or service via our Services, you should read their data usage policies or other documentation. Our linking to another site or service doesn't mean we endorse it or speak for that third party.

RETENTION PERIOD
We will store and process your Personal Information for the period of time necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Policy and in accordance with our legal and contractual obligations. For the use of the App, we store your data for the duration of such use and for up to 5 years after your termination of any use of the Services or deletion of your account (whichever occurs last), unless otherwise required by law or unless we have legitimate interests that allow us to do so for a longer term case in which data will be stored for this latter longer term. Thereafter, the data will be erased in accordance with our procedures, which may involve anonymization or destruction. If you ask us to, we will delete or anonymize your Personal Information so that it can no longer be identified, unless we are permitted or required by law to retain certain Personal Information, including in situations such as the following:
• If there is an unresolved issue related to your account, such as an outstanding claim or an unresolved complaint or dispute, we will retain the necessary Personal Information until the issue is resolved;
• Where we need to retain Personal Information for our legal, tax, audit and accounting obligations, we will retain the Personal Information required for the period required by applicable law;
• When necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to prevent fraud or to maintain the security of our users; and/or

.

There is usually no fee for exercising the above rights.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
YOUR RIGHTS UNDER US PRIVACY LAWS (INCLUDING CCPA AND VCDPA) FOR US RESIDENTS
You have certain rights in relation to BibleChat, which you can exercise by sending an e-mail to privacy@thebiblechat.com. You can invoke the consumer rights authorized at any time by submitting a request to BibleChat specifying the consumer rights you are invoking.
Rights you have as a consumer:
• To confirm whether or not BibleChat is processing your Personal Information and to access such Personal Information
• To access your Personal Information
• To correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information
• To delete Personal Information provided by or obtained about yourself
• To obtain a copy of your Personal Information that the consumer previously provided to BibleChat
• To opt out (at
privacy@thebiblechat.com
) of the processing of the Personal Information for purposes of:
(i) sale
(ii) targeted advertising,
(iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer
• To appeal a decision regarding a specific request
Some of these rights are further detailed below:
Request to opt out/Do Not Track
You have the right to opt out of sharing your personal information with our analytics and advertising partners and from selling your data.
Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information
Under certain U.S state laws, you may have the right to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive data to certain purposes such as to a) conduct internal research to improve, repair, or develop products, services, or technology, b) provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the parent or guardian of a child, perform a contract to which the consumer is a party, or take steps at the request of the consumer prior to entering into a contract; c) maintain the security and integrity of our Services, systems, and data, prevent fraud or illegal activities, and protect individuals' physical safety, and d) any other purposes allowed by future regulations under applicable U.S. state data privacy laws.
Right to complain
BibleChat shall respond to you without undue delay, but in all cases within 45 days of receipt of the request. The response period may be extended once by 45 additional days when reasonably necessary, considering the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, but we shall inform you of any such extension within the initial 45-day response period, together with the reason for the extension.
If BibleChat declines to take action regarding your request, we shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases and at the latest within 45 days of receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and also BibleChat shall provide instructions for how to appeal the declined decision.
In the unlikely case of having your request declined by BibleChat, you can appeal by sending a sufficiently substantiated notice at privacy@thebiblechat.com.
Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, BibleChat will inform you in writing of any action taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decision.
If the appeal is denied, BibleChat will provide you a method through which you can contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.
Non-Discrimination
Under U.S. state privacy laws, businesses are prohibited from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. This includes actions such as denying you a product or service, offering a lower quality or different level of service, or charging you higher prices. However, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allows businesses to offer different levels or qualities of service or charge different prices, provided the business can demonstrate that these differences are reasonably tied to the value the consumer's personal information brings to the business. This ensures that businesses can adjust their offerings in a way that reflects the value of the Personal Information they collect, without unfairly penalizing consumers for exercising their privacy rights

BookVitals App SRL is based in Romania. Personal Information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States (“US”), including by our affiliate BookVitals Inc. Also, some of our third-party providers may be based outside the European Union or the UK. Their processing of your Personal Information will involve a transfer of data outside these territories Whenever we transfer your Personal Information outside the EU or the UK, we endeavor to ensure that one of the following safeguards is in place:
• we only transfer your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of Personal Information. For more details in the EU, please see European Commission: Adequacy Decisions;
• where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts, which provide the same protection for Personal Information as in the EU or the UK;
• where such data cannot be afforded one of the above protections, we will only transfer it outside of these territories if it is necessary for the performance of our contract with you or if we have your free, informed, clear and specific consent.

If permitted by law, your continued use of the Services after this Policy has been updated indicates your acceptance of changes made. In some cases, you will be given a choice to accept changes to this Policy. If you do not accept the terms of the updated Policy, you are not allowed to continue using or accessing the Services
