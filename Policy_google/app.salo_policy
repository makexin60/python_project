Welcome to Yope App. The Yope App is a mobile application (the “App”) owned and operated by Salo App, Inc. ("Salo App, Inc.," "Company", "we", or "us"). We are making the App available to you subject to the following terms and conditions of use (the "Terms"). The Terms are a legal contract between you and Salo App, Inc. regarding your use of the App (you and others using the App will be referred to as "Users"). As long as you comply with these Terms, you have the right to download and install a copy of the App to your mobile device for your own personal use. By accessing and using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms at any time, please do not use the App.
1. Applicable Terms and Policies
a. Guidelines. When using the App, you will be subject to any additional posted guidelines or rules applicable to specific services and features (the "Guidelines"). All such Guidelines are hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms.
b. Privacy Policy. Please read our
Privacy Policy
carefully for details relating to what information and data we collect from you and other Users, and how we use that information internally and disclose it to third parties. Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
c. Modifications. From time to time, we may modify the Terms. If we do so, we will make the modified Terms available through the App, and indicate the date of the latest revision. We encourage you to review the Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the App after revised Terms have become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Terms. If you do not agree with any changes to the Terms, you must cease using the App.
d. Users Must Be 13 or Older. If you are opening a Yope App account (“Account”) on behalf of yourself, you represent that you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction and fully able and competent to agree to these Terms. You affirm that you are 13 years of age or older, as the App is not intended for, and does not knowingly collect personal information from, children under 13. If you are between 13 and 18 years old, you may use the App only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
e. Advertisements. Our App may, at some point, include advertisements, which may be targeted to the content or information on the App, queries made through the App, or from other information. The types and extent of advertising on the App are also subject to change over time.
2. Your Account
a. Account Information.
In order to use the App, you will have to create an Account. When creating an Account, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information. You also must ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. You agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your Account information and your Content in accordance with the present Terms and the Privacy Policy if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms; (c) respond to a claim that your Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond if you contact us; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company, Users and the public.
b. Phone Number. When you register, you must provide your cell phone number in order to create an Account. Your Account is associated with the cell phone number you provide to us when you register ("Account Phone Number"). If you subsequently change your cell phone number, in order to maintain your Account, you must notify us and provide us your new cell phone number within the App before you relinquish or change your Account Phone Number. If you fail to notify us before you relinquish or change your Account Phone Number, your Account will be terminated according to Section 2.e., below.
c. Account Verification. When you register, you will be provided a verification code to your Account Phone Number and asked to input the verification code. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and for restricting access to your mobile devices, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur in your Account. If you relinquish or give up your Account Phone Number, the verification will no longer work and you will not be able to access your Account. If you have reason to believe that your Account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your Account ID or if your Account Phone Number has been given to someone else), you should immediately notify us. You may be liable for the losses incurred by us or others due to any unauthorized use of your Account.
d. Prohibitions. When creating an Account, you may not (a) create any Account for anyone other than yourself without such other person's permission; (b) use a username that is the name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (c) use a username that is subject to rights of another person without appropriate authorization; or (d) use a username that is offensive, vulgar or obscene or otherwise in bad taste. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, false, misleading, or violates our Terms. We welcome you to contact us at contacts@salo.team if you believe someone is violating these Terms.
e. Termination. You may terminate your Account at any time. You agree that we may also terminate your Account or use of the App at any time in our sole discretion, and you agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination. If you or we terminate your Account, your access to the App will be terminated and your Content, as defined below, will no longer be accessible through your Account.
3. Your Content
a. General. These Terms apply to video and audio messages ("Content”) submitted by you and by other Users. You may (i) save this Content to the gallery on your mobile devise, (ii) sharing the Content within the App, including group chats, (iii) sharing the Content outside the App, (iv) make video massages with subtitles, which are formed based on the default functionality of your device itself (in particular, the iOS operating system). You shall be solely responsible for your Content and assume all risks associated with sharing your Content through and outside the App. By submitting Content to the App, you grant us the right and license to process your Content, subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy. You retain rights to your Content, subject to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, and are responsible for protecting those rights. Your Content will be stored and available to you as it described in the Privacy Policy. Further, to the extent you have an active Account, we do not have an obligation to maintain your Content in perpetuity.
b. Content Sharing and Deletion. When you share your Content through the App with other Users, such Content will be primarily hosted and stored on our Server until the User to whom you sent the Content is online in his/her Account. After the user to whom you have sent the Content appears online in his/her Account, such Content is transmitted to such User, stored in the user device's memory and is marked for deleting from our server. After 1 (one) month from the moment of automatic saving of the Content in the operating memory on the user's device, such a message will be completely deleted from our servers.  Thus, both the user who sends the message and recipient will have only 1 (one) month from the moment of receiving the message by the recipient to download it to the gallery of the device.
By submitting Content to the App, you give us your consent to store on our Server the Content you have sent to other Users, to transfer the Content to the Users to whom it is addressed, as well as to delete it from our Server after such transfer is carried out.
When you share Content through the App with other Users, such shared Content will exist in the accounts of other Users even after your Account has been terminated unless such Content is deleted from our servers as described above. Only if you permanently delete a message will it be deleted from the accounts of others and the App, but not from the user’s device in case the user hаs saved such Content before. You also have the possibility to permanently delete a video (audio) message that you recorded and sent within the App or remove such message you received from other User. Note, however, that to the extent another User has saved or shared such Content, that Content will continue to exist and we are not responsible for that Content.
c. Representations and Warranties Regarding Your Content. You represent and warrant that (a) you own your Content or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights as provided in these Terms, and (b) the sharing of your Content on or through the App does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person.
d. Prohibitions.

e. Our Right to Monitor, Edit and Remove Content. We don't have an obligation to monitor your use of the App or to review any Content, but we have the right to monitor, remove, edit, and block Content or Accounts for the purpose of operating the App, to ensure compliance with these Terms, or to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body.
