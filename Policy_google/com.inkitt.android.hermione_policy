Privacy Policy
Website
We, Inkitt GmbH, operate https://www.inkitt.com and collect certain data from you, where necessary. In the following privacy policy, you will be informed what we do with your data, so-called personal data, and why we do this. We will also inform you how we protect your data when this data is deleted, and what rights you have within data protection.
Who can I contact?
Responsible for this website is:
Inkitt GmbH
Saarbrücker Str. 36
10405 Berlin
E-Mail:
[email protected]
Via the contact data, you can reach our Data Protection Officer or another relevant contact person for data protection. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have specific questions about your personal data, deletion of your personal data, or similar requests.
What are my rights?
You can contact us at any time if you have any questions about your rights regarding data protection or if you wish to exercise any of the following rights:
Right to withdraw your consent in accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you wish to cancel a previously given consent to a newsletter)
Right to access your data in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you would like to know what data we have stored about you)
Right to correct your data in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if your e-mail address has changed and we should replace your old e-mail address)
Right to have your data deleted in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you want us to delete certain data that we have stored about you)
Right to limit data collection in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you do not want us to delete your e-mail address, but only to send absolutely necessary e-mails)
Right to data portability in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us to receive your data in a zipped format, if you want to upload it to another website)
Right to object how your data is handled in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you do not agree with advertising or user analytics procedures as described within this privacy policy)
Right to send complaints to the supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 para. 1 f GDPR (e.g. you can contact the data protection supervisory authority directly: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm)
Deletion of data and storage periods
Unless otherwise stated, we will delete or anonymize your data as soon as it is no longer needed, e.g. your e-mail address after you have unsubscribed from a newsletter. Your data will also be deleted or blocked automatically if the mandatory storage period expires. Such data may be needed for longer periods of time for legal reasons. You can request information about all personal data we have stored about you. Data protection inquiries and other legal matters may also be stored for a longer period of time within the scope of the legally relevant retention and statute of limitations periods.
Contacting us
When contacting us via email, the User's details are stored for the purpose of processing the enquiry and, if applicable, follow-up questions based on your consent based on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) a. GDPR or fulfilling your request based on Art. 6 (1) b. GDPR.
Visiting our website
If you merely wish to browse our website, we do not collect any personal data, with the exception of the data that your browser sends to us, e.g.:
Approximate location based on IP range (e.g. "Berlin city")
Date and time of visit (e.g. 11:55 on 25.05.2023)
Last visited website (e.g. google.com)
Browser and version (e.g. Chrome or Safari)
Operating system (e.g. Mac OS)
As a protective measure in favor of your privacy, we delete or anonymise the IP address after your visit to our website. This means that the other technical data can no longer be traced back to you and are only used for anonymous, statistical purposes to optimize our website. The purpose of the temporary storage of the data is, on the one hand, the technical necessity for establishing the connection and, on the other hand, the correct, error-free presentation of our website. The IP address and the technical data already mentioned are necessary to display the website, prevent display problems for visitors, and correct error messages. The legal basis is the so-called legitimate interest, which has been examined in the context of the aforementioned protective measures as well as in accordance with the European data protection requirements from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Automated Decision making (including "profiling")
In general we do not process any data via "profiling" or in form of automated decision-making via the Website or Service. However, such profiling may happen by third-party providers through the Website or Service. We will inform you about such fact if possible.
Data Security
We have implemented sufficient measures to ensure data and IT security. The Website is operated through a safe SSL connection. If an SSL connection is activated, third parties are prevented from reading any data that you transfer to us.
Sign up
You also have the option of signing up on our website and then logging in at any time with a user account. To register with us, the following data is required:
E-mail address
User name
Password
Gender
Date of birth
As a protective measure, data is transmitted via a secure connection like the rest of the website. After successful confirmation, your data will be stored until you decide to delete individual data or the entire user account. The purpose of the data requested is the creation of a user account that provides extended functionality to the website. Sign-up is voluntary and can be withdrawn or the user data deleted at any time. The legal basis is your consent in accordance with the European data protection requirements under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. In cases where the sign-up is required for the mutual conclusion of the contract, the legal basis is the fulfillment of the contract in accordance with the European data protection requirements from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
Participation in the Inkitt Community and use of the Service
For taking part in our community through our Website you are asked to provide us with certain data. Such data will only be sent and provided to us after you clicked the respective 'submit' button on the Website.
This data may include the following information for the following purposes:
Your user name is required to log-in to your account
Your email address is required for account verification
Your gender is required for our recommendation engine
Your date of birth is required to enforce restrictions of content for under-aged users
Your favorite genre is required to provide you with recommendations
Your interests are required to provide you with recommendations
Social Sign-In & Social Login
In addition to manual registration, we provide the option of logging in directly to us with your existing user account of a social network from selected providers. We use Google Login for this purpose. If you wish to use one of these functions, you will be redirected to the page of the respective provider and navigated through the registration process.
As a protective measure, the data you enter is transmitted via an encrypted connection of the respective platform. We do not use the registration to access personal data such as friend lists or contacts or to store them for our own purposes. A permanent link between your user account and the user account at Google does not take place. We do not know what data social networks collect in the course of registration or how data is linked. Further details can be found in the privacy statements of Google. The purpose of the requested data is the registration via an existing user account for the use of extended functions on the website. Registration via social networks is voluntary and can be revoked or the user account can be logged out at any time. The legal basis is your consent in accordance with the European data protection requirements from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.
Newsletter
If you are interested in receiving updates about our company or our products, you can subscribe to our newsletter. You will then receive an e-mail in which you must click on a link to confirm receipt of the newsletter. We will then save your e-mail address until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, you will find a corresponding link to unsubscribe in every e-mail of our newsletter. The delivery of the newsletter is carried out by the specialized service provider Sendgrid by Twilio. Further information can be found in the service provider's privacy policy: https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy.
As a protective measure, we ask for a so-called "Double-Opt-In" to ensure that the registered e-mail address actually belongs to you. Furthermore, we have entered into a data processing agreement with the assigned service provider. You are also able to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time and thus delete your e-mail address from the service provider's database. The purpose of the data requested is to send the newsletter to your personal e-mail address in order to fulfill your request for updates about our company or our products. The legal basis is your consent in accordance with the European data protection requirements under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
Job applications
Insofar as you apply to us online or otherwise respond to one of our job ads, we collect and process the personal applicant data for the purpose of handling the application process. The processing is primarily carried out electronically. This is particularly the case if corresponding application documents are submitted electronically to us, for example by e-mail or via a web form located on the website. If we conclude an employment contract, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If we do not conclude an employment contract, the application documents will be deleted six months after notification of the rejection decision - this retention period is justified by a potential obligation to provide evidence in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). If consent was given, applications may also be retained for longer than six months.
As part of the job application process, we also use a recruiting and applicant management software, which is provided by the service provider BambooHR. This software helps us to place job advertisements and manage applications centrally. For this purpose, we have concluded a data processing agreement to ensure that the personal data of our applicants is only processed in accordance with our instructions. Further information can be found in the service provider's privacy policy: https://www.bamboohr.com/privacy-policy/
The legal basis is the establishment and performance of the employment relationship on the basis of an employment contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, Art. 88 GDPR with § 26 BDSG (Federal Data Protection Act of Germany, where applicable).

Privacy Policy - Galatea Stories
We only share data that is necessary for the performance of the mutual contract or if you have given us your consent, for example in the context of our newsletter or cookie banner. If no contract exists yet, we share the data in certain cases in the context of legitimate interests. This is the case, for example, if you only want to visit our website or contact us. When you visit our website, it is in the interest of both parties to provide access to the services and to communicate with each other.
We have also entered into data processing agreements with all external recipients to comply with European legal requirements. Depending on your location, some of the above service providers - if specified - will also transfer your data to the United States. The European Court of Justice has ruled that the United States does not have an equivalent level of data protection to the EU and authorities may be able to access data without due process. Additional safeguards are therefore required to ensure a sufficient level of data protection. To meet this requirement, we have concluded additional data processing agreements called Standard Contractual Clauses. We also check each service provider together with our data protection officer and ensure that additional security measures are available, such as strong encryption of data

Privacy Policy
Website
We, Inkitt GmbH, operate https://www.inkitt.com and collect certain data from you, where necessary. In the following privacy policy, you will be informed what we do with your data, so-called personal data, and why we do this. We will also inform you how we protect your data when this data is deleted, and what rights you have within data protection.
Who can I contact?
Responsible for this website is:
Inkitt GmbH
Saarbrücker Str. 36
10405 Berlin
E-Mail:
[email protected]
Via the contact data, you can reach our Data Protection Officer or another relevant contact person for data protection. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have specific questions about your personal data, deletion of your personal data, or similar requests.
What are my rights?
You can contact us at any time if you have any questions about your rights regarding data protection or if you wish to exercise any of the following rights:
Right to withdraw your consent in accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you wish to cancel a previously given consent to a newsletter)
Right to access your data in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you would like to know what data we have stored about you)
Right to correct your data in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if your e-mail address has changed and we should replace your old e-mail address)
Right to have your data deleted in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you want us to delete certain data that we have stored about you)
Right to limit data collection in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you do not want us to delete your e-mail address, but only to send absolutely necessary e-mails)
Right to data portability in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us to receive your data in a zipped format, if you want to upload it to another website)
Right to object how your data is handled in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR (e.g. you can contact us if you do not agree with advertising or user analytics procedures as described within this privacy policy)
Right to send complaints to the supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 para. 1 f GDPR (e.g. you can contact the data protection supervisory authority directly: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm)
Deletion of data and storage periods
Unless otherwise stated, we will delete or anonymize your data as soon as it is no longer needed, e.g. your e-mail address after you have unsubscribed from a newsletter. Your data will also be deleted or blocked automatically if the mandatory storage period expires. Such data may be needed for longer periods of time for legal reasons. You can request information about all personal data we have stored about you. Data protection inquiries and other legal matters may also be stored for a longer period of time within the scope of the legally relevant retention and statute of limitations periods.
Contacting us
When contacting us via email, the User's details are stored for the purpose of processing the enquiry and, if applicable, follow-up questions based on your consent based on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) a. GDPR or fulfilling your request based on Art. 6 (1) b. GDPR.
Visiting our website
If you merely wish to browse our website, we do not collect any personal data, with the exception of the data that your browser sends to us, e.g.:
Approximate location based on IP range (e.g. "Berlin city")
Date and time of visit (e.g. 11:55 on 25.05.2023)
Last visited website (e.g. google.com)
Browser and version (e.g. Chrome or Safari)
Operating system (e.g. Mac OS)
As a protective measure in favor of your privacy, we delete or anonymise the IP address after your visit to our website. This means that the other technical data can no longer be traced back to you and are only used for anonymous, statistical purposes to optimize our website. The purpose of the temporary storage of the data is, on the one hand, the technical necessity for establishing the connection and, on the other hand, the correct, error-free presentation of our website. The IP address and the technical data already mentioned are necessary to display the website, prevent display problems for visitors, and correct error messages. The legal basis is the so-called legitimate interest, which has been examined in the context of the aforementioned protective measures as well as in accordance with the European data protection requirements from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Automated Decision making (including "profiling")
In general we do not process any data via "profiling" or in form of automated decision-making via the Website or Service. However, such profiling may happen by third-party providers through the Website or Service. We will inform you about such fact if possible.
Data Security
We have implemented sufficient measures to ensure data and IT security. The Website is operated through a safe SSL connection. If an SSL connection is activated, third parties are prevented from reading any data that you transfer to us.
Sign up
You also have the option of signing up on our website and then logging in at any time with a user account. To register with us, the following data is required:
E-mail address
User name
Password
Gender
Date of birth
As a protective measure, data is transmitted via a secure connection like the rest of the website. After successful confirmation, your data will be stored until you decide to delete individual data or the entire user account. The purpose of the data requested is the creation of a user account that provides extended functionality to the website. Sign-up is voluntary and can be withdrawn or the user data deleted at any time. The legal basis is your consent in accordance with the European data protection requirements under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. In cases where the sign-up is required for the mutual conclusion of the contract, the legal basis is the fulfillment of the contract in accordance with the European data protection requirements from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
Participation in the Inkitt Community and use of the Service
For taking part in our community through our Website you are asked to provide us with certain data. Such data will only be sent and provided to us after you clicked the respective 'submit' button on the Website.
This data may include the following information for the following purposes:
Your user name is required to log-in to your account
Your email address is required for account verification
Your gender is required for our recommendation engine
Your date of birth is required to enforce restrictions of content for under-aged users
Your favorite genre is required to provide you with recommendations
Your interests are required to provide you with recommendations
Social Sign-In & Social Login
In addition to manual registration, we provide the option of logging in directly to us with your existing user account of a social network from selected providers. We use Google Login for this purpose. If you wish to use one of these functions, you will be redirected to the page of the respective provider and navigated through the registration process.
As a protective measure, the data you enter is transmitted via an encrypted connection of the respective platform. We do not use the registration to access personal data such as friend lists or contacts or to store them for our own purposes. A permanent link between your user account and the user account at Google does not take place. We do not know what data social networks collect in the course of registration or how data is linked. Further details can be found in the privacy statements of Google. The purpose of the requested data is the registration via an existing user account for the use of extended functions on the website. Registration via social networks is voluntary and can be revoked or the user account can be logged out at any time. The legal basis is your consent in accordance with the European data protection requirements from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.
Newsletter
If you are interested in receiving updates about our company or our products, you can subscribe to our newsletter. You will then receive an e-mail in which you must click on a link to confirm receipt of the newsletter. We will then save your e-mail address until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, you will find a corresponding link to unsubscribe in every e-mail of our newsletter. The delivery of the newsletter is carried out by the specialized service provider Sendgrid by Twilio. Further information can be found in the service provider's privacy policy: https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy.
As a protective measure, we ask for a so-called "Double-Opt-In" to ensure that the registered e-mail address actually belongs to you. Furthermore, we have entered into a data processing agreement with the assigned service provider. You are also able to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time and thus delete your e-mail address from the service provider's database. The purpose of the data requested is to send the newsletter to your personal e-mail address in order to fulfill your request for updates about our company or our products. The legal basis is your consent in accordance with the European data protection requirements under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
Job applications
Insofar as you apply to us online or otherwise respond to one of our job ads, we collect and process the personal applicant data for the purpose of handling the application process. The processing is primarily carried out electronically. This is particularly the case if corresponding application documents are submitted electronically to us, for example by e-mail or via a web form located on the website. If we conclude an employment contract, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If we do not conclude an employment contract, the application documents will be deleted six months after notification of the rejection decision - this retention period is justified by a potential obligation to provide evidence in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). If consent was given, applications may also be retained for longer than six months.
As part of the job application process, we also use a recruiting and applicant management software, which is provided by the service provider BambooHR. This software helps us to place job advertisements and manage applications centrally. For this purpose, we have concluded a data processing agreement to ensure that the personal data of our applicants is only processed in accordance with our instructions. Further information can be found in the service provider's privacy policy: https://www.bamboohr.com/privacy-policy/
The legal basis is the establishment and performance of the employment relationship on the basis of an employment contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, Art. 88 GDPR with § 26 BDSG (Federal Data Protection Act of Germany, where applicable).

Privacy Policy - Galatea Stories
We only share data that is necessary for the performance of the mutual contract or if you have given us your consent, for example in the context of our newsletter or cookie banner. If no contract exists yet, we share the data in certain cases in the context of legitimate interests. This is the case, for example, if you only want to visit our website or contact us. When you visit our website, it is in the interest of both parties to provide access to the services and to communicate with each other.
We have also entered into data processing agreements with all external recipients to comply with European legal requirements. Depending on your location, some of the above service providers - if specified - will also transfer your data to the United States. The European Court of Justice has ruled that the United States does not have an equivalent level of data protection to the EU and authorities may be able to access data without due process. Additional safeguards are therefore required to ensure a sufficient level of data protection. To meet this requirement, we have concluded additional data processing agreements called Standard Contractual Clauses. We also check each service provider together with our data protection officer and ensure that additional security measures are available, such as strong encryption of data

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls

For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:
Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like
Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.
Legal bases of processing
We process your information for the
purposes
described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
We process your data in order to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract.
We process your data for our legitimate interests and those of
third parties
while applying
appropriate safeguards
that protect your privacy.
We process your data when necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person.
We process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so.
We ask for your consent to process your data for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
How you use Google services and your privacy settings will determine what data is processed, the purposes for which this data is processed, and the legal bases for processing data. The table below explains these processing purposes, the kinds of data processed, and the legal grounds for processing this data, in more detail.
Why and how we process data
What data is processed
Legal grounds
To provide Google services, products, and features
Examples of processing activities:
We process the terms you search for in order to return results.
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video.
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account.
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, we use your shipping address or delivery instructions for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
We process your payment information when you buy extra storage for Google Drive.
We can use contact info (like names and email addresses) of people you interact with in Google products to make it easier to find who you’re looking for when you want to share and communicate with these people in other Google services like Gmail, Photos and Assistant.
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail.
Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
We can help you share your location using
Google Location Sharing
, so that others can find you on a map, or know your estimated time of arrival.
As described in the
Sharing your information
section, we’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent, and provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account.
The information processed will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
Things you create or provide to us
:
Content you create, upload, or receive (like photos, videos, emails, docs and spreadsheets).
Google Dashboard
allows you to manage information associated with specific products.
Personal information that you provide us when you create a Google Account (like your
name
and password,
phone number
, date of birth, or
payment information
).
Information that we collect as you use our services
:
Information about your apps, browsers & devices
, such as
unique identifiers

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.

This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more

and
why you may see particular ads

advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.

A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.

the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Information that you provide
We collect information about you when you input it into our Site or the Service or otherwise provide it directly to us.
Account and profile creation
We collect information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, and set preferences for the Service. For example, you may provide your contact information, including your first and last name, email address, and password when you register for the Service. You may also have the option of adding an avatar to your profile to be displayed in the Service. We keep track of your preferences when you select settings within the Service, including marketing and notification settings.
Sign in via other platforms
Instead of creating a user account, you can log in via your account with other platforms (currently Google, Github, or Azure Devops). We will not collect the password that you use for the relevant platform, but we may collect details from your account with the platform, such as username and email address.
Requests and inquiries
You may choose to provide us with information when you contact us about our Service or otherwise interact with us. For example, you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with our Service and send us screenshots to help in resolving the problem. You may submit your contact information to register for our events, to subscribe to receive marketing communications from us, or to make an inquiry through our Site. You may also provide content to us when you participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstake, activity, or event, including via social media and other content platforms.
Purchases
If you register for a paid Service, we will collect purchase information, such as the Service plan that you purchase and information related to refunds, credits, and cancellations, and your billing address and payment information. Please note that any payment information you provide is sent directly to a third-party payment processor. We have no access to and do not store your payment information.
Information that we collect from your device and usage
We collect certain information about your device and how you and your device interact with us and our Site or Service. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (together, ”
Europe
”), this information may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws.
Specifically, the information we collect will include information such as your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, operating system, software installed on your device, product keys, general location information (such as inferred from an IP address), and referring URL.  We also collect information about how you and your device have interacted with our Site or Service or with us via email, including the pages you accessed, features you used, Service you purchased, links you clicked, and when you accessed and for how long.
Some of this information is collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading
“Cookies and similar tracking technology”
below.
Information that we obtain from third-party sources
From time to time, we receive personal information about you from third-party sources (including social media and other content platforms, public databases, and from our business and channel partners and service providers).
The types of information we collect from third parties include name, email addresses, job titles, and social media profiles. We may combine this information with information we collect through other means described above. This helps us to maintain and improve the accuracy of our records, identify new customers, deliver personalized communications, and suggest services that may be of interest to you.

Legal basis for processing personal information
If you are based in Europe, we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable European laws. This means we collect and process your information only where:
We need it to provide the Site or Service, including to register you as a new user, operate the Site or Service, provide technical support, and to protect the safety and security of the Site or Service;
It satisfies our legitimate interests, such as to market and promote the Service and to protect our legal rights and interests, which are not overridden by your own interests, rights, and freedoms;
It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or in connection with a legal claim, such as to respond to judicial orders or subpoenas; or
You provide consent for a specific purpose, such as for marketing communications (where consent is required under applicable marketing laws).
The legal bases depend on the type of information and the purpose for our processing. In some contexts, more than one legal basis applies. When we process your information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on such consent before it is withdrawn. To exercise your rights, see
“Your data protection rights”
below. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g., your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Service.
Return to top
Who does Sentry disclose my personal information to?
We disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
Affiliate companies
who help operate and improve our Site and Service (including to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Site and Service), offer other Sentry affiliated services to you, or who otherwise process personal information for the purposes described in this policy. The protections of this policy apply to the information we disclose in these circumstances.
Third-party services providers
who provide hosting, storage, support, payment processing, billing, communication, analysis, and other services to us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access or use information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under appropriate security and confidentiality procedures designed to protect your information.
Third-party go-to-market partners
who provide referral, sale, resale, or similar go-to-market services. We may disclose your information, like your name, email address, and job title, in connection with their services. We may also disclose information to these third parties where you have agreed to that disclosure.
Third-party analytics partners
to provide analytics services. These entities may use Cookies in the same way we do, to among other things, track and analyze data, and better understand your online activity.
Third-party platforms
when you, your administrator or other Service users choose to install or enable third-party apps, add-ons or other platforms for use with the Service. Doing so may give the providers of those platforms access to your account and information about you, like your name and email address, and any content you choose to connect with those platforms. Please note that when you use third-party platforms, your use will be governed by their own terms and privacy policies.
Any
competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party
where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.

Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “
Cookies
”) to collect and use personal information about you, including to understand and save your preferences, and to compile aggregate data about Site and Service interaction.
We may also allow certain third parties (e.g., service providers such as Stripe) to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site or Service. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed, non-human-readable form.
You may refuse to accept Cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of Cookies. You can find information on popular browsers and how to adjust your Cookie preferences at the browser provider’s websites.

How does Sentry keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet, or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. In particular, email sent to or from Sentry may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.
Return to top
International data transfers
In some cases your personal information is transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, our Site and Service are hosted in the United States and Germany, and our affiliate companies and third-party service providers operate around the world, including in the United States, Canada and Europe. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries.
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of Europe and Switzerland, which have been formally recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” from the European Commission and Swiss Federal Administration, and “adequacy regulations” from the Secretary of State in the United Kingdom.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this policy. The safeguards we use are the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses, the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, and other appropriate legal mechanisms. This is how transfers of personal information between our group companies and with our third-party service providers will be safeguarded.
Data Privacy Framework Notice
Functional Software, Inc. (our registered company name) participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the
“Data Privacy Framework”
) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information about you that is transferred from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the U.S.  We have self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles for all information about you that is received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. We have also self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (together with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles, the
“Data Privacy Framework Principles”
) for all information about you that is received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles will govern.
As required under the Data Privacy Framework, when we receive information under the Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Data Privacy Framework if the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We may be required to disclose information about you under the Data Privacy Framework in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view Sentry’s certification, please see the
Data Privacy Framework website
.
We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Data Privacy Framework-related (or general privacy-related) complaint and we commit to resolve any such complaint. We have further committed to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework to JAMS, a U.S.-based alternative dispute resolution provider.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your Data Privacy Framework-related complaint from us, or if you are not satisfied with our response to your Data Privacy Framework-related complaint, please visit
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution

Data retention
We retain the personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (e.g., to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).  In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our relationship has ended. For example, we may retain your data for longer than the usual retention period when we have a legal obligation to do such, to deal with and resolve requests and complaints, to protect an individual’s rights and property, and for litigation and regulatory matters. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of any legal requirement. The criteria we use to determine the retention period include:
How long is the personal information needed to provide the Service or operate our business?
This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of the Service, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.
Is there an automated control, such as in your Sentry dashboard, that enables you to access and delete the personal information at any time?
If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.
Is the personal information of a sensitive type?
If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.
Has consent been provided for a longer retention period?
If so, we will retain the data in accordance with your consent.
Is Sentry subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data?
Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal reason to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (e.g., because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

We also ask you to create a password and name your account (or accounts, if you have more than one).
Customer Account Data -
We process certain personal data to manage our relationship with you and administer you or your company’s account. This includes purchase history, names or contact information of individuals authorized to manage the Twilio account on behalf of our customer to set up, access and manage billing.

Payment Information -
In connection with Services you pay for, we ask you to provide our payment processor with your payment method information like a credit card or your Paypal account and your billing address. Our payment processor, acting on our behalf, gathers this so we can bill you for your use of our Services. Our payment processor will share your billing address with Twilio for this purpose.
Personalization Details -
Some of our products, such as our short code service, may require you to complete an application form by providing details about your or your company’s  intended use of the product to determine eligibility for these products.

Support and Feedback -
When you interact with us on our websites including through our AI chatbots (e.g. our Help Center Assistant), over the phone or via email, we process the phone number or email address that you use, the content of your interaction and the feedback you provide about our Services.

Security Identifiers or SIDs -
When you sign up for an account with Twilio, we’ll automatically assign you and each of your accounts a unique security ID and generate an API token for each account.

When you use certain US voice-based communications services, Twilio collects information associated with your service usage. This includes information such as the number of phone calls, call destinations, call locations, type, and service configuration, and is known as Customer Proprietary Network Information ('CPNI').

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.

If you are a
US resident
interested in what personal data we have disclosed lately for our business purposes, here’s a list:
Identifiers
Commercial information
Financial information
Internet or other electronic activity information
Geolocation information
Professional or employment information
By “our business purposes,” we mean that we only disclose personal data as we describe in the section "
How We Disclose Personal Data
" above.  Also, as described in the “How We Use Cookies & Other Tracking technologies” section below, we process personal data to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ websites and mobile apps. Some of these activities may be considered “sharing” or “targeted advertising” under certain laws. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.
You also have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Privacy Notice or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
You may have additional rights under our
Binding Corporate Rules
in the EU. For example, where you believe your personal data has been transferred by an EU-based Twilio company to our US headquarters and processed by the US company in breach of the Binding Corporate Rules, you may have a right to:
Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.
If Twilio processes your personal data as a data processor on behalf of a customer, we will either direct you to contact our customer to exercise your rights.
How To Exercise Your Rights and Choices

Accessing and Controlling Account Data
As part of our Services, we provide you with a number of self-service features at no additional cost within the Twilio console itself, including the ability to access your data, update any incorrect data, download a copy of your data, delete your data, or restrict the use of your data. You can make various choices about your Customer Account Data through the account portal when you log into your Twilio account or through the marketing preferences center.

Customer Support
. Please be aware that closure or deletion of your Twilio account will result in you permanently losing access to your account and the data in the account. After closure of your account, certain information associated with your account may remain on Twilio’s servers in an aggregated form that does not identify you. Similarly, after you close your account, we will retain data — including personal data — associated with your account that we are required to maintain for legal purposes or for necessary business operations (see “
How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.
Identity Verification
In some instances, we will need to verify your identity before honoring your request. We will generally verify your identity by asking you to provide personal data related to your recent interactions with us. Thereafter, we will process your request and inform you of any decisions we have made about your request.  Additionally, you may exercise your privacy rights through an authorized agent. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
.
We won’t discriminate against you or change the price of our services if you make a request, but if you ask us to delete your data, it may affect your ability to use our Services.
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)
As an individual Twilio account holder or as an authorized representative of a Twilio customer in the US, you have the right to restrict Twilio’s use of
CPNI
. To opt-out of the use of CPNI data related to your Twilio account to market other Twilio Services based on your usage of our Services, click
here
.  Please note that, if you have subscribed for the services on behalf of an organization, the CPNI relates to the service usage by that organization and not you individually. Opting-out of the use of CPNI for marketing will not unsubscribe you from other types of marketing contacts from Twilio and will not affect the status of the services you currently have with us. Your approval or opt-out of the use of your CPNI outside of the services to which you are already subscribed is valid until you affirmatively revoke or limit such approval.

Twilio uses common information gathering tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels and other similar tracking technologies to automatically collect information as you navigate our websites, your account or when you interact with emails we send to you.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your browser or elsewhere on your hard drive. Cookies allow Twilio to identify your device as you navigate our websites or your account. This makes navigating and interacting with our websites or your account more efficient, easy and meaningful for you.
Twilio uses both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies are cookies that disappear from your computer or browser when you turn off your computer. Persistent cookies stay on your computer even after you’ve turned it off.

To learn more about each category of cookie, you can visit our cookie consent tool by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting.

If you decide to change your preferences at a later date, you can easily do so by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Please note that Required Cookies cannot be disabled and if you decide to opt-out of Functional Cookies, certain functionality of our websites or your account may be impacted.  Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific.

If you believe an underage person has signed up for a Twilio account, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com

Automated Decision Making
Automated decision-making occurs when an electronic system uses personal data to make a decision about you, without human involvement. Twilio uses automated decision-making leveraging a variety of signals derived from records we collect or obtain from third party vendors, to help monitor, identify, and suspend accounts sending spam or engaging in other abusive or fraudulent activity.  We may also use this information to evaluate your account application and make decisions about whether to approve or decline. If your account is suspended or not approved under these circumstances you will be notified and given an opportunity to request human review of the decision.
We may rely on other automated decision-making where:
We have notified you of the decision and provided you with the opportunity to request a human review of the decision
It is necessary to perform a contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights
We have your consent and we have put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights

Twilio Product Privacy
Twilio offers a range of industry-leading communications and customer data platform services to our customers. Depending on the Service, Twilio may be a data controller and data processor of personal data used to provide the Services.
Twilio processes personal data (Communications Usage Data and Customer Content) for most of our Services as a data processor acting on the instruction of our customer and in accordance with the terms of our agreement with a customer, our
Data Protection Addendum
, and service specific terms. Our Services provide customers with ways to control, access and secure their data.
We also offer customers the ability to store, delete, access, or exercise other choices about their personal data. The ability to make these choices depends on the Service being used and how it is being used by a customer. Customers are referred to our
API docs
for each of our Services, along with SendGrid’s
documentation
and Segment’s
documentation
to find more detailed information about managing personal data collected and stored in connection with their use of our Services. We also provide an overview of our retention and deletion practices, including how to delete data you control in our
support documentation
. We provide information about the security measures we use to protect our customer’s data  in our
Security Overview
, and if you are located in a country that requires you to obtain information about our supplemental measures, you may read more about those measures
here
.
For some of the Services we also act as a data controller where disclosed and agreed to by our customer in the agreement, Data Protection Addendum, product specific terms or via the customers’ use and configuration of a product or feature.As a data controller, Twilio is responsible for the processing of the personal data.
For more detail on our Services, please find information below or by visiting our
products page
.
Authy
The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.

How We Share Personal Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions Involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the AWS Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.
Third-Party Service Providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Us and Others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of AWS, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.
At Your Option:
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
Location of Personal Information
Amazon Web Services, Inc. is located in the United States, and our affiliated companies are located throughout the world. Depending on the scope of your interactions with AWS Offerings, your personal information may be stored in or accessed from multiple countries, including the United States. Whenever we transfer personal information to other jurisdictions, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.

Google Cloud Privacy
                      Notice
Effective Date: February 6, 2025
This Google Cloud Privacy Notice describes how we collect
                      and process your personal information in relation
                      to
Google Workspace (including Google Workspace for Education)
,
Google Cloud Platform
,
Google Cloud Marketplace
,
Cloud Identity
(when sold separately),
Implementation Services
and
Google Cloud Training
(together,
                      “Cloud Services”).
We offer Cloud Services to our customers either directly
                      or via our authorized partners. Where we refer to our
                      customers in this notice, we also mean our partners and
                      their customers.
If European Union (EU), UK or Swiss data protection law
                      applies to the processing of Service Data relating to you,
                      you can review the
                      ‘
European Privacy Standards and GDPR
’
                      section below to learn more about your rights and Google’s
                      compliance with these laws.
If your organization has entered into our
Google Workspace for Education Service Data Addendum
,
                      please review the
Supplemental Google Cloud Privacy Notice
together with this notice.
Google processes Customer Data, Partner Data and Service
                      Data to provide Cloud Services. This Privacy Notice
                      applies solely to Service Data and
does
                        not
apply to Customer Data or Partner Data. We
                      explain what we mean by “Service Data” below.
Customer Data and Partner Data are defined in the
                      agreement(s) with our customers covering Cloud Services
                      and represent the data that you and our customers provide
                      for processing in Cloud Services. For more information
                      about how we process Customer Data and Partner Data, see
                      our
Cloud Data Processing Addendum (Customers)
and
Cloud Data Processing Addendum (Partners)
.
Service Data is the personal information Google collects
                      or generates during the provision and administration of
                      the Cloud Services and related technical support,
                      excluding any Customer Data and Partner Data.
Service Data consists of:
Account information.
We collect the data you or
                        your organization provide when creating an account for
                        Cloud Services or entering into a contract with us
                        (username, names, contact details and job titles).
Cloud payments and
                          transactions.
We keep reasonable
                        business records of charges, payments, and billing
                        details and issues.
Cloud settings and configurations.
We
                        record your configuration and settings, including
                        resource identifiers and attributes, and service and
                        security settings for data and other resources.
Technical and operational details of your
                          usage of Cloud Services.
We collect
                        information about usage, operational status, software
                        errors and crash reports, authentication details,
                        quality and performance metrics, and other technical
                        details necessary for us to operate and maintain Cloud
                        Services and related software. This information includes
                        device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens,
                        and IP addresses.
Your direct communications.
We keep
                        records of your communications and interactions with us
                        and our partners (for example, when you provide
                        feedback, ask questions or seek technical support).
Google processes Service Data for the following purposes:
Provide Cloud Services you request.
We use Service Data primarily to deliver the Cloud
                        Services that you and our customers request. This
                        includes processing Service Data as needed to conduct
                        checks before extending credit to certain customers, to
                        bill for the Cloud Services used, to ensure those
                        services are delivered or working as intended, to detect
                        and avoid outages or other technical problems, and to
                        secure your data and services.
Make recommendations to optimize use of Cloud
                          Services.
We use Service Data to provide you
                        and our customers with recommendations (for example,
                        suggesting ways to better secure your account or data,
                        reduce service charges or improve performance, or
                        optimize your configurations), and providing information
                        about new or related products and features. We also
                        evaluate your responses to our recommendations and other
                        feedback (if you choose to provide it).
Maintain and improve Cloud Services.
We evaluate Service Data to help us improve the
                        performance and functionality of Cloud Services. As we
                        improve Cloud Services for you, this will improve them
                        for our customers, and vice versa.
Provide and improve other services you
                          request.
We use Service Data to deliver and
                        improve other services that you and our customers
                        request, including Google or third-party services that
                        are enabled via the Cloud Services, administrative
                        consoles, application programming interfaces (APIs) or
                        command line interfaces (CLIs), or the Google
                        Workspace Marketplace.
Assist you.
We use Service Data to
                        provide technical support for Cloud Services that you
                        and our customers request, and to assess whether we have
                        met your needs. We also use Service Data to improve our
                        technical support, inform you and our customers about
                        updates to Cloud Services and send other notifications
                        relating to Cloud Services.
Protect you, our users,
customers,
the public, and Google.
We use Service Data
                        to detect, prevent and respond to fraud, abuse, security
                        risks, and technical issues that could harm you, other
                        users, our customers, the public, or Google. This
                        helps make our services safer, more reliable, and more
                        secure.
Comply with legal obligations.
We use
                        Service Data to comply with our legal obligations (for
                        example, where we’re responding to legal process or an
                        enforceable governmental request, or meeting our
                        financial record-keeping obligations).
To achieve these processing purposes, we use algorithms
                      to recognize patterns in Service Data, manual review of
                      Service Data (such as when you interact directly with our
                      billing or support teams), aggregation or anonymization of
                      Service Data to eliminate personal information, and
                      combination of Service Data with information from other
                      Google products and services. We also use Service Data for
                      internal reporting and analysis of applicable product and
                      business operations.
Please note, if your organization has entered into our
Google Workspace for Education Service Data Addendum
:
your organization will process Service Data collected
                        or generated from Google Workspace for Education, as a
                        controller, for purposes it is required to disclose to
                        you separately; and
Google’s processing purposes listed above will not
                        apply to you. The purposes that apply to you are
                        described in the
Supplemental Google Cloud Privacy Notice
.
                        Please visit that link to learn more.
We maintain data centers around the world, and provide
                      Google Workspace (including Google Workspace for
                      Education) and Cloud Identity (when sold separately) from
these locations
,
                      and Google Cloud Platform from
these locations
.
Service Data may be processed on servers located outside
                      of the country where our users and customers are located
                      because Service Data is typically processed by centralized
                      or regionalized operations like billing, support, and
                      security.
Regardless of where Service Data is processed, we apply
                      the same protections described in this Privacy Notice.
                      When transferring Service Data outside of the European
                      Economic Area, the UK or Switzerland, we comply with
                      certain
legal frameworks
.
We build Cloud Services with strong security features to
                      protect your data. The insights we gain from providing our
                      services help us detect and automatically block security
                      threats from ever reaching you.
We work hard to protect the Service Data we hold from
                      unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure,
                      or destruction, including by:
Encrypting Service Data at rest and while in transit
                        between our facilities.
Regularly reviewing our Service Data collection,
                        storage, and processing practices, including our
                        physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized
                        access to our systems; and
Restricting access to Service Data to Google
                        employees, contractors, and agents who need it in order
                        to process Service Data for us. Anyone with this access
                        is subject to strict contractual confidentiality
                        obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they
                        fail to meet these obligations.
We instruct our affiliates to process Service Data for
                      the purposes listed under
                      "
Why We Process Service Data
"
                      above, in compliance with this Privacy Notice and
                      appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We do not share Service Data with companies,
                      organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in
                      the following cases:
When you procure third-party services
We share Service Data outside
                      of Google when you or our customer choose(s) to procure a
                      third-party service through Google Cloud Platform, the
                      Google Cloud Platform Marketplace or the Google Workspace
                      Marketplace, or use a third-party application that
                      requests access to your Service Data.
With your consent
We’ll share Service Data
                      outside of Google where we have obtained your consent.
With your administrators and authorized resellers
When you use Cloud Services,
                      your administrator and resellers authorized to manage your
                      or your organization’s account will have access to certain
                      Service Data. For example, they may be able to:
View account and billing information, activity and
                            statistics
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Access your account information in order to
                            satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process,
                            or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your
                            information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We do not sell your Service
                      Data to any third parties.
We share Service Data with
                      trusted third party providers to process it for us as we
                      instruct them and in compliance with this Privacy Notice
                      and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. In
                      particular, we share Service Data with our third party
                      providers when you request technical support services (we
                      share the information you provide in the support ticket,
                      and those providers may communicate with you or your
                      administrator in that ticket, including providing updates
                      and closing the ticket) and professional services (we
                      share your contact details to enable communication and
                      collaboration).
For legal reasons
We share Service Data outside
                      of Google when we have a good-faith belief that access to,
                      or disclosure that Service Data is reasonably necessary
                      to:
Comply with applicable law, regulation, legal
                            process, or enforceable governmental request. We
                            share information about the number and type of
                            requests we receive from governments in
                            our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable agreements, including
                            investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
                            security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or
                            safety of Google, our customers, users, and the
                            public as required or permitted by law.
If Google is involved in a
                      reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets,
                      we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of Service
                      Data and give affected users notice before Service Data
                      becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Your organization may allow you to access and export your
                      data in order to back it up or transfer it to a service
                      outside of Google. Some Google Cloud Services enable you
                      to directly access and download the data you have stored
                      in the services. As further described in our
Google Workspace Data Subject Requests Guide
,
                      you or your organization may use various tools to access,
                      control, and export your data.
You and your organization’s administrator can access
                      several types of Service Data directly from Google Cloud,
                      including your account information, billing contact
                      information, payment and transaction information, as well
                      as product and communication settings and configurations.
If you’re otherwise unable to access your Service Data,
                      you can always request it

We retain Service Data for different periods of time
                      depending on the type of data, how we use it, and how you
                      configure your settings. When we no longer need Service
                      Data, we delete or anonymize it.
For each type of Service Data and processing operation,
                      we set retention timeframes based on the purposes for
                      which we process it, and ensure that the Service Data is
                      kept for no longer than necessary. We retain most types of
                      Service Data for a set period of up to 180 days (the exact
                      number depends on the specific type of data). However,
                      some Service Data may be kept for longer periods where
                      there is a business need. We generally have longer
                      retention periods (which can be over a year) for Service
                      Data that is kept for the following purposes:
Security, fraud and abuse prevention.
We retain
                        Service Data when it is necessary to protect against
                        fraudulent attempts to gain access to user accounts, or
                        to investigate violations of applicable Cloud Services
                        agreements. Usually, the Service Data retained where
                        there is reason to suspect fraud or abuse would include
                        device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens,
                        and IP addresses, as well as log data about usage of the
                        Cloud Services.
Complying with legal or regulatory requirements.
We
                        retain Service Data when required by an enforceable
                        legal process, such as when Google receives a lawful
                        subpoena.
Complying with tax, accounting or financial requirements.
When Google processes a payment for you, or when you
                        make a payment to Google, we retain Service Data about
                        those transactions (including billing information),
                        typically for a minimum of five years, as required for
                        tax or accounting purposes, or to comply with applicable
                        financial regulations.
At the end of the applicable retention period, we follow
                      detailed protocols to make sure that the Service Data is
                      securely and completely deleted from our active systems
                      (the servers Google uses to run applications and store
                      data) or retained only in anonymized form. After
                      completion of these steps, copies of Service Data will
                      remain for a limited period in our encrypted backup
                      systems (which we maintain to protect Service Data from
                      accidental or malicious deletion and for outage and
                      disaster recovery purposes), before being overwritten by
                      new backup copies.
Your Google Account is your connection to all Google
                      products and services, not just Cloud Services. When you
                      choose to use Google products and services outside of
                      Cloud Services,
                      the
Google Privacy Policy
describes how your personal information (including your
                      Google Account profile information) is collected and used.
                      You and your administrator can control which other Google
                      services you may use while logged into a Google Account
                      managed by your organization.
If you interact with Cloud Services using a Google
                      Account managed by your organization, then your personal
                      information may be subject to your organization’s privacy
                      policies and processes, and you should direct privacy
                      inquiries to your organization.
Exercising your data protection rights
If European Union (EU), UK or Swiss data protection law
                      applies to the processing of Service Data relating to you,
                      you have certain rights, including the rights to access,
                      correct, delete and export your Service Data, and to
                      object to or request that we restrict processing of your
                      Service Data.
Google Cloud EMEA Ltd will be the data controller
                      responsible for your Service Data. However, where our
                      customer has entered into an agreement covering Cloud
                      Services with a different Google affiliate, that affiliate
                      will be the data controller responsible for processing
                      your Service Data in connection with billing for the Cloud
                      Services only.
If you want to exercise your data protection rights with
                      regard to Service Data we process in accordance with this
                      Privacy Notice, and you are not able to do so via the
                      tools available to you or your organization’s
                      administrator, you can contact Google via our
Privacy Help Center
.
You can always contact your local data protection
                      authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under
                      local law.

,
                      please review the
Supplemental Google Cloud Privacy Notice
for information about the legal grounds we rely on when
                      processing your Service Data collected or generated from
                      Google Workspace for Education.
Additional information (Switzerland)
If Swiss data protection law applies to the processing of
                      your Service Data, the following additional information is
                      relevant.
Please see the section titled ‘Where Service Data is
                      Stored’ (above) for information on where we and our
                      affiliates process Service Data. We also disclose your
                      Service Data to service providers, partners and other
                      recipients (see the section titled ‘How We Share Service
                      Data’) that are located or process information in any
                      country in the world.
We comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the
                      transfer of information as set out in our
Legal Frameworks for Data Transfers
page. We may also transfer your information to a third
                      country based on an exception provided for by the Swiss
                      Federal Data Protection Act.
An exception may apply in the event of legal proceedings
                      abroad, in cases of overriding public interest or if the
                      performance of a contract with you or in your interest
                      requires disclosure, if you have consented, if the
                      information has been made generally available by you and
                      you have not objected to the processing, or the disclosure
                      is necessary in order to protect the life or the physical
                      integrity of you or a third party and we can't get consent
                      within a reasonable period of time, or the information
                      originates from a register provided for by Swiss law which
                      is accessible to the public or to persons with a
                      legitimate interest, provided that the legal conditions
                      for the consultation of such register has been met in the
                      specific case.
If Brazilian data protection law applies to the
                      processing of Service Data, you have certain rights,
                      including the rights to access, correct, delete or export
                      your Service Data, as well as to object to or request that

                      we collect for Google Cloud Platform is Cloud Brasil
                      Computação e Serviços de Dados Ltda. The Data Protection Officer is Kristie
                      Chon Flynn. If you want to
                      exercise your data protection rights with regard to
                      Service Data we process in accordance with this Privacy
                      Notice and are not able to do so via the tools available

                      And you can contact your data protection authority if you
                      have concerns regarding your rights under Brazilian law.
In addition to the purposes and grounds described in this
                      Privacy Notice, we may process Service Data on the
                      following legal grounds:
Where necessary for the performance of a
                          contract with you
We may process your information where necessary for
                          us to enter into a contract with you or to comply with
                          our contractual commitments to you.
When we’re complying with legal
                          obligations
We’ll process your information when we have a legal
                          obligation to do so.
When we’re pursuing legitimate
                          interests
We may process Service Data based on our legitimate
                          interests and those of third parties while applying
                          appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This
                          means that we process your information in the
                          interests of providing Cloud Services you request;
                          making recommendations to optimize use of Cloud
                          Services; maintaining and improving Cloud Services;
                          providing and improving other services you request;
                          assisting you; and protecting against harm to the
                          rights, property or safety of Google, our users, our
                          customers, and the public, as required or permitted by
                          law.
Some U.S. state privacy laws require specific
                      disclosures.
These laws may include:
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA);
Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA);
Colorado Privacy Act (CPA);
Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and
                        Online Monitoring (CTDPA);

Florida Digital Bill of Rights (FDBR);
Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA);
Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA); and
Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA).
This Privacy Notice is designed to help you understand
                      how Google handles Service Data:
We explain the categories of Service Data Google
                          collects and the sources of that Service Data in
Service Data We Collect
.
We explain the purposes for which Google collects and
                          uses Service Data in
Why We Process Service Data
.

                          Google does not sell your Service Data to any third
                          parties. Google also does not “share” your Service
                          Data as that term is defined in the California
                          Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
We explain how Google retains Service Data in
Retention and Deletion of Service Data

                          We maintain policies and technical measures to avoid
                          re-identifying that information.
U.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request
                      information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses

                                Services and related technical support, and
                                other services you request, and ensure they are
                                working as intended, such as tracking outages or
                                troubleshooting bugs and other issues that you
                                report to us.

                                security measures. For example, we may rely on
                                service providers to help provide technical
                                support.

When you procure third-party services.
We disclose Service Data outside of Google when
                                you or our customers choose(s) to procure a
                                third-party service through Google Cloud

                                third-party application that requests access to
                                your Service Data.
With your consent. We’ll disclose Service Data
                                outside of Google when we have obtained your
                                consent.

When you use Cloud
                                Services, your administrator and resellers
                                authorized to manage your or your organization’s
                                account will have access to certain Service
                                Data.
For external processing.
We disclose
                                Service Data with trusted third party providers
                                to process it for us as we instruct them and in
                                compliance with this Privacy Notice and
                                appropriate confidentiality and security
                                measures. In particular, we disclose Service
                                Data with our third party providers when you
                                request technical support services (we use the

                                details to enable communication and
                                collaboration).
For legal reasons.
We disclose Service
                                Data outside of Google when we have a good-faith
                                belief that access to disclosure of that Service
                                Data is reasonably necessary to:
Comply with applicable law, regulation,
                                    legal process, or enforceable governmental
                                    request. We share information about the

                      transferred overseas, you may refrain from using services
                      and not provide your personal information. However,

Retention period
and deletion
of
personal information.
We retain Service Data only for as long
                      as necessary to fulfill the purposes of collection and use described above.
                      For each type of data and operation, we set retention timeframes based on the
                      purpose for its collection, and ensure it is kept for no
                      longer than necessary.
If the retention period expires or you request deletion,
                      Google will faithfully endeavor to delete or anonymize such Service
                      Data unless there is a legal obligation that requires
                      processing or another lawful basis for retaining the
                      Service Data. When we receive a request to delete Service
                      Data, the retention period of the archive copy expires,
                      and then Google's archiving system has a mechanism to
                      overwrite the expired data.
We retain most types of Service Data for a set period of
                      up to 180 days (the exact number depends on the specific
                      type of data). However, we generally have longer
                      retention periods (which can be over a year) for Service
                      Data that is kept for (i) Security, fraud and abuse
                      prevention, (ii) complying with legal or regulatory
                      requirements including the Communications Secrets
                      Protection Act. We also have retention periods of a
                      minimum of five years for Service Data about payments and
                      billing information for complying with tax,
                      accounting or financial requirements, each as further
                      described
here

Measures undertaken to protect retained personal information.
Establishment of general policy
Google establishes and publishes this
Privacy Notice
outlining our general policy relating to Service Data.
Establishment of internal policy relating to handling of personal data
Google establishes internal policies about handling
                      measures and persons in charge and their responsibility
                      etc. with regard to the acquisition, utilization, records,
                      provision, deletion etc. of personal data.
Internal organization as security control action
Google has large security and privacy teams responsible
                      for developing, implementing, and reviewing internal
                      personal data handling processes. Google employees are
                      trained to report suspected incidents involving personal
                      data, which may be done through various channels such as
                      through dedicated email addresses or digital platforms. A
                      dedicated team assesses reported incidents, and as
                      appropriate a coordinated team is assigned to manage the
                      overall incident, including liaising with Legal and the
                      product team as part of the investigation and response.
                      The team on-call for an incident is assigned on a daily
                      rotation. Incident responses may follow either a standard
                      or an expedited route, depending on the severity and
                      priority assigned to the incident.
Personnel measures as security control action
Google conducts periodical training for its employees
                      about matters to consider when handling personal data.
Physical measures as security control action
Google takes measures to prevent unauthorized persons
                      from accessing personal data in any situation and to
                      prevent theft or loss of devices and electronic media for
                      handling personal data.
Technical measures as security control action

for further information on the security measures
                      undertaken to secure, retain and delete Service
                      Data
Research of external environment
Data protection laws vary among countries, with some
                      providing more protection than others. Google has
                      established a personal information protection system to
                      ensure your information is accorded protections equivalent
                      to APPI, as described in the
Privacy Notice
.
                      Regardless of where your information is processed, Google
                      applies the same personal information protection
                      measures globally. We also comply with certain legal
                      frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the
                      European frameworks. For more detail, please see
Data transfer frameworks
.
                      Further, with regard to the location of our data centers
                      storing Service Data, please see
here
.
                      There may be cases where Google entrusts the processing of
                      information to subprocessors or its subsidiaries or
                      affiliates. With regard to the location of Google’s
                      offices including subsidiaries and affiliates, please see

                      applicable law, please email

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. We
                      will not make any significant changes without notifying
                      you in advance by posting a prominent notice on this page
                      describing the changes or by sending you a direct
                      communication. We encourage you to regularly review this

                      last changes were published.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center

a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account

You may save a number of different kinds of Personal Data using Link. For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.
Learn More

You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe
. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.

Services

Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies in Stripe’s

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center
, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing your Personal Data.

Transaction Data

Identity/Verification Information
. Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Customers, including about your online activity, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers
To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them.

During payment transactions, your Personal Data is shared with various entities in connection with your transaction.

Please review your merchant’s, bank’s, and payment method provider’s privacy policies for more information about how they use and share your Personal Data.
Financial services
. Certain Business Users leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via Stripe or our Financial Partners. For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User. In addition to any Transaction Data we may generate or receive when these cards are used for purchases, we also collect and use your Personal Data to provide and manage these products, including assisting our Business Users in preventing misuse of the cards. Please review the privacy policies of the Business User and, if applicable, our bank partners associated with the financial service (the brands of which may be shown on the card) for more information.
Identity/Verification services
. We use Personal Data about your identity to perform verification services for Stripe or for the Business Users that you are transacting with, to prevent fraud, and to enhance security.

The Business Users you choose to do business with may further share your Personal Data with third parties (like additional third party service providers other than Stripe). Please review the Business User’s privacy policy for more information.
Advertising by Business Users

How does Stripe protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse we use security measures to comply with federal law.  These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.  We impose access controls along with ongoing monitoring to prevent data misuse, and we require our service providers to take similar steps to protect your information.
How does Stripe collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
• open a Link account;
• ask Stripe to process a payment for goods or services;
• provide bank account information to Stripe using Financial Connections
We also collect your personal information from others, such as affiliates or other companies.
Why can’t I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
• sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
• affiliates from using your information to market to you
• sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you.
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See the Other Important Information section below for more information on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.

We only share data that is necessary for the performance of the mutual contract or if you have given us your consent, for example in the context of our newsletter or cookie banner. If no contract exists yet, we share the data in certain cases in the context of legitimate interests. This is the case, for example, if you only want to visit our website or contact us. When you visit our website, it is in the interest of both parties to provide access to the services and to communicate with each other.
We have also entered into data processing agreements with all external recipients to comply with European legal requirements. Depending on your location, some of the above service providers - if specified - will also transfer your data to the United States. The European Court of Justice has ruled that the United States does not have an equivalent level of data protection to the EU and authorities may be able to access data without due process. Additional safeguards are therefore required to ensure a sufficient level of data protection. To meet this requirement, we have concluded additional data processing agreements called Standard Contractual Clauses. We also check each service provider together with our data protection officer and ensure that additional security measures are available, such as strong encryption of data.
