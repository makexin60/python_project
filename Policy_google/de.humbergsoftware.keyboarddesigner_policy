Using the App Keyboard Designer
1. Installation
The installation transfers information to the Play Store. Thus, for example, in which country and at what time the app was installed. The provider of the app has no influence on this data collection.
2. Usage
Two of the basic goals of the app are, on the one hand, not to request data from other apps of the mobile device and, on the other hand, not to automatically send data from the device. For this reason, the app does not request any authorizations. This means that the user can be sure that no data is send from the device automatically. There is no way to log in to the app. The data required for operation is stored in the local database on the device. At the user's request, he can output some of this data using the keyboard function. Only in the event of an error (see next point) can data be sent with the user's consent, which is obtained each time.
3. Occur of an error
If there is an error in the software, it can usually be intercepted within the software and indicated in the keyboard display. The user can then decide for himself if he wants to send the error to the support. To do this, the designer can be called up and an e-mail can be created using a button on the "Settings" tab. This will be displayed on the mobile device so that any information sent to support can be viewed.
If the error can not be intercepted within the software, the operating system will prompt you to report the error.
