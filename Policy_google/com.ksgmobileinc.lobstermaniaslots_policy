Personal information may be collected directly from you when you register an account with the Service, when you access and participate in message boards / forums or when you communicate with Customer Support or when you participate in surveys or questionnaires.
Passive Collection
Passive personal information collection refers to personal information that is collected from your device(s) automatically and sent to our servers without your intervention.  Examples of personal information collected passively are your IP address, referral data, information about your browser and the hardware you are using.
KSG Mobile and service providers acting on behalf of KSG Mobile may uses a variety of tracking tools to collect personal information.  Such tracking tools may include, without limitation:
Cookies.  Like many companies, we use "cookies" to collect personal information.  Cookies are small data files placed on a Device when it is used to access the Service.  KSG Mobile, or our third-party advertising service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to tell us whether you have visited the website before, if you are a new visitor or to otherwise facilitate site navigation, and to personalize your experience while using the Service.  Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent using the Service and pages visited.  Cookies also allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are using the Service.  Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences.  If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) to disable existing cookies; or (iii) to set your browser to automatically reject any cookies.  However, please be aware that if you disable or reject cookies, some features and services on our Service may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your profile.  In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
Web Beacons.  Certain areas of the Service may contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking beacons and clear GIFs).  A web beacon is a transparent graphic image placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed or that an email has been forwarded.  In addition, a web beacon allows third parties to obtain personal information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.  A web beacon may also tell your browser to get content from another server.
Third Parties
KSG Mobile may get personal information about you from third parties such as social media platforms or other service providers we use, and we will only use that personal information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and such policy under which that personal information was collected.
