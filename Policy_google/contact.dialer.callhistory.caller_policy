While using Our Service We may ask You to provide Us with some necessary technical information. Technical information may include, but is not limited to: IP-address, Your country, Usage Data, device language, device internet speed, and device information number from Your device so that the Services can be provided to You. This collected information is required for Appvestor to verify that Your device is accurately registered.

Appvestor accesses and processes phone numbers of, and duration of, incoming and outgoing calls and contact lists with Your explicit consent, to be able to provide You with Our Caller ID service. Appvestor also accesses and makes use of the Advertising Identifier (Advertiser ID) connected to the installed app and may access and use the documentation on Your consent within Your Google Account setting regarding personalized advertisements. Documentation on this consent only entails a unique ID, which is generated when You install the mobile application and make Your choice regarding advertisements. Appvestor cannot trace advertiser IDs, or the unique ID related to a consent back to the identity of a specific user. To be able to offer you certain features of the Application, Appvestor may, only with Your explicit consent, request access to your location data, which may include Your background location, approximate location, and precise location.
Appvestor may ask Your app provider to provide Us access to some necessary technical information. Technical information may include but is not limited to: device information number from Your device so that the Services can be provided to You.

Such technical information may include, but is not limited to, device identification numbers, usage data, and advertiser identifiers. The collection of this information is required to verify the proper registration of Your device. Appvestor does not have the capability to associate advertiser identifiers with the identity of any specific user.
For applications only using Appvestor Technology and not Our Sevices, we do not share any of Your data with Our data partners or third parties.

Developer Program Policies
and reserves the right to use anonymous data for statistics and user support without restrictions regarding applicability in time.

Retention of Your Data
Appvestor will process and retain anonymized Usage Data for analysis purposes. Your Data will be retained until the purpose of use is achieved or You choose to have it deleted. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods. How long specific personal data is retained depends on the purpose for its use, however, we will delete your personal data in accordance with applicable law.
Legal Basis for the Processing of Your Data
Appvestor processes personal data to pursue Our legitimate interest in managing Our business – including being able to handle contracts and purchases of various products and licenses for Our business and to improve, develop and market Our Services, and comply with Our legal obligations. The legal basis for Our processing is thus the following articles in the general data protection regulation:
Article 6 (1), litra a, according to which personal data may be processed with express consent.
Article 6 (1), litra b, according to which personal data may be processed if this is necessary to fulfill a contract.
Article 6 (1), litra c, according to which personal data may be processed if this is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.
Article 6 (1), litra f, according to which personal data may be processed if this is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest unless the interests of the data subject precede this.
Note:
Because We process Your data partly on basis of Article 6 (1) litra f, (legitimate interests) You may in certain cases object to Our otherwise lawful processing of Your personal data if You find that Your interests in not having Your data processed exceeds Our legitimate interests in processing Your data, cf. article 21 in the general data protection regulation. See further below on Your rights under the data protection regulation.
Transfer of Your Data
Your Data (the advertiser ID and unique ID regarding consent), may be processed in any place where Our Data Partners are located. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — servers located outside of Your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of Your jurisdiction.
If Your data is transferred to a country outside the EU/EEA, and if the country in question has not been approved by the European Commission as providing adequate protection (
See list of adequacy decisions here
) Our data transfers will be based on
Standard Contractual Clauses
(SCC) also approved by the European Commission.
Furthermore, Appvestor will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.
We have agreements with the following Data Partners.
