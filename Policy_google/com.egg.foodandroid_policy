1.  Information We Collect About You
ELEX collects information you provide directly to us via the
Services, certain technical information automatically when you use our
Services, and when other sources (i.e., third parties) provide it to us. As
explained below, some of the information we collect may identify you personally
(whether alone or in combination). This is considered personal information.
A. Information You Provide To Us
There are several opportunities for you to provide or disclose
personal information directly to us via the Services. The decision whether to
provide the information to us belongs to you. If you prefer not to disclose the
information, you will still be able to utilize the Services, but may not be
able to utilize all aspects of them. The information you choose to provide to
us will either be processed with your affirmative consent, pursuant to a
contractual necessity or in furtherance of our legitimate business interests.
Profile Information:
We collect
information about you when you create or modify your profile, set preferences,
and sign-up for or make purchases through the Services. For example, depending
on the Service, you may have the option of adding a display name, profile
photo, age, gender, geographic information and other details to your profile
information to be displayed in the Service.
Content you provide through our products:
We collect and store content that you send, receive and
share when you use the Services. This content includes any information about
you that you may choose to include. Examples of content we collect and store
include but are not limited to: your email address, when you choose to give it
to us; the messages you post, exchange or reply in message boards, forums or
chat areas, including, in certain Services, voice messages you send to your
friends; information you provide in connection with a survey or contest; and
any feedback you provide to us. Content also includes the files and links you
upload to the Services, including art you create and share with us and other
users in our Services, and pictures and audio recording you upload.
Content you provide through our websites:
We also collect content you submit to our websites, which
include social media or social networking websites operated by us (e.g., our
Facebook pages). For example, you provide content to us when you provide
feedback or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys,
contests, promotions, activities, or events.
Information you provide through our support channels:
The Services also include our customer services and
technical support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a
problem you are experiencing with a Service. Whether you speak to one of our
representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team (or our
third-party service providers), you will be asked to provide contact information,
a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation,
screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue. You
may upload photos and voice messages to customer service. Whatever information
you provide will be used solely to address your request for support.
Payment Information:
We collect
certain payment and billing information when you purchase certain paid
Services. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card
details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.
B. Information Collected Automatically
We collect certain information automatically from and about the
device(s) you utilize to access the Services and your use of the Services.
Specifically, we and/or our third-party service providers collect your Internet
Protocol (IP) address, type of device, operating system, browser type, language
settings, device IDs, mobile advertising IDs (e.g., for Android users, the GPS
ADID also known as the “Google Play Services ID for Android”), MAC address,
GSSF ID, usage data (including the features of the Services you use, and when
and how often you use the Services), URLs of referring/exit pages, and crash
data. We use your IP address and/or country preference to approximate your location
(i.e., country and, at times, city) to provide you with a better experience,
and in some of our Services, we also collect precise geolocation data from your
device (i.e., street-level).
Some of the Services use cookies and similar tracking technologies,
such as pixel tags, to automatically collect information from and about your
device(s) and your use of the Services. A “cookie” is a small file that is
saved on your computer or mobile device, which uniquely identifies your browser
and provides information to the cookie sender. Pixel tags are small blocks of
code on a webpage that allow websites to do things like read and place cookies.
We also use third-party software development kits (also known as SDKs) in our
mobile apps, which collect information about your device(s) and use of the
Services. These trackers help us to deliver the Services to you, to improve
your user experience and to analyze traffic on and use of the Services. In
addition, they are used for marketing and advertising, including to help us to
measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and potentially for
interest-based advertising by third parties.

Frequently Asked Questions
All Content
ESRB ratings
Rating process
Ratings at retail
How was the rating system created?
The ESRB rating system was founded by the video game industry in 1994 after consulting a wide range of child development and academic experts, analyzing other rating systems, and conducting nationwide research with parents. ESRB found that parents wanted a rating system that has both age-based categories and concise and impartial information regarding content. With this philosophy in mind, today the ESRB administers a
three-part system
that includes Rating Categories, Content Descriptors, and Interactive Elements.
Does ESRB rate only physical games, or does it rate mobile and online games too?
Since 1994, the ESRB rating system has established itself as a familiar, reliable means for parents to gauge the suitability of video games for their children. Although consumers may be more familiar with ESRB ratings on physical (boxed) games, increasingly ESRB ratings can be found for apps, VR, and online games.
The ESRB is one of the founding rating authorities of the
International Age Rating Coalition (IARC)
, which administers a streamlined process for assigning age and content ratings to digitally delivered games and mobile apps. The Microsoft Store for Windows and Xbox, the Nintendo eShop, the PlayStation Store, the Google Play Store, Google Stadia, and the Oculus Store are among the digital storefronts that have deployed the IARC rating system, which facilitates the display of ESRB ratings on devices in North America.
LEARN MORE ABOUT WHERE TO FIND RATINGS
Are all games required to have a rating?
The rating system is voluntary, however all console manufacturers as well as certain U.S. retailers and mobile or online storefronts require ESRB ratings for the games or apps they offer.
Does the ESRB have any restrictions on how a game can be marketed?
Publishers of physical (boxed) games carrying an ESRB rating are contractually bound to follow the industry-adopted
Principles and Guidelines for Responsible Advertising Practices
, including requirements addressing how rating information must be displayed on game packaging and in advertising. There are also certain restrictions on where ads for Mature-rated games may appear. The ESRB’s Advertising Review Council (ARC) diligently monitors industry compliance, and if a game publisher is found to have inappropriately labeled or advertised a product, the ESRB is empowered to compel corrective actions and impose a wide range of sanctions, including monetary fines.
Publishers of digitally delivered games and apps are strongly encouraged to provide consumers with clear and prominent disclosure of ESRB rating information as well as comply with the ESRB advertising and marketing guidelines.
Who decides which rating should be assigned?
ESRB ratings for physical (boxed) video games are based on the consensus of at least three specially trained raters who collectively assess a game’s content and deliberate about what rating should be assigned to a game. Some raters are also required to play-test games post-release to ensure that complete and accurate content disclosure was provided to ESRB when it was originally submitted for rating. To eliminate the risk of outside influence, including from industry members and the media, the identities of ESRB raters are kept confidential, and they are not permitted to have any ties to or connections with any individuals or entities in the video game industry.
Games and apps that are only available online are rated via
IARC
, a streamlined rating process designed specifically for digitally delivered games and apps.
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE RATINGS PROCESS
How does the ESRB rate downloadable content (DLC) or other content updates that supplement a game or app?
Downloadable content (DLC) often refers to additional content that supplements or extends a previously-rated product. In most cases, the
rating assigned
to a game also applies to its DLC. However, if the DLC content exceeds the rating assigned to the “core” product, it must be submitted, and a different rating may be assigned to the DLC.
Should the ESRB find DLC or other update that is incompatible with the original rating, the developer and appropriate digital storefronts will be notified of a change to the rating for the DLC or, in the case where the update is required, a rating change for the core product.
Do ESRB raters play the games they rate?
ESRB raters do not play through games during the rating process for a variety of reasons. First, many games can have upwards of 50 hours of gameplay, so requiring a minimum of three raters to play through hundreds of physical (boxed) games rated annually would be impractical. Additionally, games are player-controlled and enable many different permutations of gameplay depending upon how the player decides to approach a situation. We do, however, play-test many games after release to help ensure all pertinent content was disclosed during the
rating process
.
How does the ESRB know companies have fully disclosed all of the content in their game or app, and what happens if they don’t?
Through a combination of post-release testing and monitoring of public comments ESRB verifies that all content pertinent to a rating has been reviewed. Should we find that a game or app has been assigned a rating based on incomplete or inaccurate content disclosure, we work to ensure that the rating is promptly corrected wherever it is displayed to consumers, be it a game box, an advertisement, or an online or mobile storefront. For physical (boxed) games, failure to disclose pertinent content during the
rating process
may also be addressed with formal
sanctions and penalties
.
Do video game retailers support and enforce the ESRB rating system?
Most major retailers have established their own store policies requiring ESRB ratings to be displayed on the video games they carry. Additionally, they have also implemented age verification for the sale or rental of M (Mature) and AO (Adults Only) rated games.
ESRB Retail Council (ERC)
members conduct regular mystery shop audits to help ensure high levels of compliance. According to the
Federal Trade Commission
, unaccompanied children who attempt to purchase a Mature-rated video game are stopped 87% of the time.
How can parents manage which games their children play?
Virtually all devices that children use to play games include parental control settings which parents can activate to manage what and how their children play. Depending on the device, parents can manage certain features like how much money their child can spend, who they can play with online, which games can be played based on the age rating, time spent playing them, and more. Consult the
ESRB Parental Controls Guides
for step-by-step instructions on setting up parental controls for your console, handheld, phone, tablet, or personal computer. We also encourage parents to establish household rules which this
Family Discussion Guide
can help initiate.

Data Privacy Framework
Adjust Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

2. Tracking Technologies on our Website
Google Analytics
We use the Google Analytics service of the provider Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland on our website.
Google Analytics is a web analytics service that allows us to collect and analyze data about the behavior of visitors to our website. Google Analytics uses cookies for this purpose, which enable an analysis of the use of our website. This involves processing of personal data in the form of online identifiers (including cookie identifiers), IP addresses, device identifiers and information about interaction with our website.
Some of this data is information that is stored in the terminal device you are using. In addition, further information is also stored on your end device via the cookies used. Such storage of information by Google Analytics or access to information that is already stored in your terminal device only takes place with your consent.
Google Ireland will process the data collected in this way on our behalf in order to evaluate the use of our website by the users, to compile reports on the activities within our website and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our website and the use of the internet. In doing so, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.
The personal data processed on our behalf to provide Google Analytics may be transferred to any country in which Google Ireland or Google Ireland's sub-processors maintain facilities. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries".
In addition to the option to reject Google Analytics in our Consent Banner, you can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google Ireland within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the IP address be transferred to Google on a server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other data. You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
We use the Google Analytics 4 variant, which allows us to track interaction data from different devices and from different sessions. This allows us to put individual user actions in context and analyze long-term relationships.
The data about user actions are stored for a period of 14 months and then automatically deleted. All other event data is stored for 2 months and are then automatically deleted. Thereby, the deletion of the data whose storage period has expired takes place automatically once a month.
Google Ads
We use the online advertising program Google Ads of Google Ireland, Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”) on our website, through which we place advertisements on the Google search engine. When you access our website via a Google ad, Google sets a cookie on your terminal device ("conversion cookie"). In the process, a different conversion cookie is assigned to each Google Ads customer, so that the cookies are not tracked across the websites of different Ads customers. The information obtained with the help of the cookie is used to create conversion statistics. This tells us the total number of users who clicked on one of our Google ads. However, we do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified. When using the service, a transfer of your data to the USA cannot be excluded. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries". You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
Google Remarketing
We also use the Google Analytics advertising features (remarketing) from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This function enables us, in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google, to display advertisements in a more targeted manner and to present users with ads that are tailored to their interests. Via the remarketing, users are shown ads and products for which interest has been identified on other websites in the Google network. The function allows us to link advertising target groups created via Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device functions of Google Ads. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to a user depending on previous usage and surfing behavior on an end device (e.g. cell phone) can also be displayed on another end device of the user (e.g. tablet or PC).
If you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history with your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be placed on every end device on which you log in with your Google account. The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based solely on your consent, which you can give or withdraw at Google. For these linked services, data is then collected via Google Analytics for advertising purposes. To support the remarketing function, Google Analytics collects users' Google-authenticated IDs, which are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data. This is used to define and create target groups for cross-device ad advertising.
Privacy policy of Google:

.
Google Signals
We use the Signals feature of Google Analytics, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Signals recognises individual users using different devices (so-called cross-device tracking). We only receive anonymous data in the form of a report that shows patterns in user behaviour. Google Signals helps us to better understand how visitors interact with our website and to show more meaningful and personalized ads to these visitors after leaving our website.
For this, session data is being processed and linked with website visitors that
• have a Google account;
• are logged in to their Google account when they access the corresponding website; and
• have turned on the “Ads personalization” feature in their Google account.
If you do not wish to be subject to the Signals feature, you can deactivate the “Ads personalization” feature in your Google account.

Meta Pixel (formerly known as Facebook Pixel)
We use the "visitor action pixels" from Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Meta") on our website. This allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to our website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Meta, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Meta may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with
Facebook's Data Usage Policy

3. Legal basis for processing personal information
Information for the EEA and Switzerland (GDPR)
If you are a visitor from the EEA (i.e., European Union
                        Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) or
                        Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using
                        the personal information described above will depend on
                        the personal information concerned and the specific
                        context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information
                        from you only where we have your consent to do so, where
                        we need the personal information to perform a contract
                        with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate
                        interests and not overridden by your data protection
                        interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  In some
                        cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect
                        personal information from you or may otherwise need the
                        personal information to protect your vital interests or
                        those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply
                        with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with
                        you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and
                        advise you whether the provision of your personal
                        information is mandatory or not (as well as of the
                        possible consequences if you do not provide your
                        personal information).
Similarly, if we collect and use your personal
                        information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or
                        those of any third party), we will make clear to you at
                        the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information

                        your personal information, please contact us using the

                        you browse our Website and enhance the level of services

                        also be able to refuse certain web beacons by adjusting
                        the settings on your browser or device.  Please refer to

5. Does AIHelp transfer Personal Information
                        internationally?
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed by
                        us where we engage service providers (e.g. the U.S.). It
                        may therefore be processed outside of your country of
                        residence, which may have different data protection
                        rules to those of your country.  Where we do so, our
                        collection, storage and use of your Personal Information
                        will at all times be in accordance with this Privacy
                        Statement and applicable laws.
We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that
                        your personal information will remain protected in
                        accordance with this Privacy Policy.
You can direct any questions or complaints about the use
                        or disclosure of your Personal Information to us at
privacy@aihelp.net
. We will investigate and resolve any complaints or
                        disputes regarding the use of Personal Information
                        timely after receiving your complaint.
If you have an unresolved privacy complaint that we have
                        not addressed satisfactorily, we commit to cooperate
                        with the panel established by the EU data protection
                        authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection
                        and Information Commissioner, as applicable, and to
                        comply with the advice given by them in respect of the
                        complaint.

You may have the option to select binding arbitration
                        for the resolution of your complaint under certain
                        circumstances.
For information on how to request access, rectify or
                        deletion of your Personal Information if it is
                        inaccurate or processed in violation, see “Questions or
                        Concerns” below.  Furthermore, we commit to giving you
                        an opportunity to opt out if Personal Information we
                        control about you is to be disclosed to any independent
                        third parties, or is to be used for a materially
                        different purpose from the purposes set out in this
                        Privacy Statement.  If you otherwise wish to limit the
                        use or disclosure of your Personal Information, please
                        write to us at the contact details further below.
6. How does AIHelp protect your Personal Information?
The security of your Personal Information is very
                        important to us and we go to great lengths to ensure
                        data are kept secure.  We use appropriate technical and
                        organizational security measures to protect your
                        Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized
                        access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, both
                        during transmission and once we receive it. However, no
                        method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
                        electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore we cannot
                        guarantee its absolute security.

                        offered through them.  The privacy and security
                        practices of websites linked to or from the Service are
                        not covered by this Privacy Statement, and AIHelp is not

8. Data Security and Retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where
                        we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so
                        (for example, to fulfill your orders or to comply with
                        applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
In addition to this, we implement a rolling two-year
                        data retention policy. This means that, in most cases,
                        we will retain your personal data for a period of two
                        years from your last interaction with us.
After this period, or when we have no ongoing legitimate
                        business need to process your personal information, we
                        will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not
                        possible (for example, because your personal information
                        has been stored in backup archives), then we will
                        securely store your personal information and isolate it
                        from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, AIHelp
                        shall delete or return to Customer the Personal Data
                        (including copies) in AIHelp’s possession. This
                        requirement shall not apply to the extent that AIHelp is
                        required by applicable law to retain some or all of the
                        Personal Data or to Personal Data archived on backup
                        systems.
9. Your data protection rights
If you wish to
access, correct, update or request deletion
of your personal information, you can do so at any
                          time by contacting us using the contact details
                          provided under the “Questions or Concerns” heading

of
                          your personal information or
request portability
of
                          your personal information. Again, you can exercise
                          these rights by contacting us using the contact
                          details provided under the “Questions or Concerns”
                          heading below.
You have the right to
opt-out of marketing communications we
send you at any time.  You can exercise this right
                          by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in
                          the marketing e-mails we send you.  To opt-out of
                          other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or
                          telemarketing), then please contact us using the
                          contact details provided under the “Questions or
                          Concerns” heading below.

withdraw your consent
at
                          any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect
                          the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to
                          your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your
                          personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
                          processing grounds other than consent.
You have the
right to complain to a data protection
                            authority
about our collection and use of your personal
                          information.  For more information, please contact
                          your local data protection authority. (Contact details

                          Switzerland and certain non-European countries
                          (including the US and Canada) are available

AIHelp will not use Customer Data to train or
                          fine-tune any AI/ML models without Customer's prior
                          permission or instruction.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals
                        wishing to exercise their data protection rights in
                        accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Please note that, as stated above, if you are an
                        individual whose personal information has been collected
                        through the AIHelp services (e.g. you have submitted a
                        support request to a company that uses our customer
                        support technology) then we are acting as a data
                        processor on behalf of those companies. You will need to
                        contact the company (our customer) directly to exercise
                        the rights above and they will respond to you
                        accordingly. We will provide assistance to our customers
                        to respond to your requests where required, in
                        accordance with their instructions and the terms of our
                        agreement with them.
10. Children’s Personal Information
We do not knowingly collect any personal information
                        from children under the age of 16. If you are under the
                        age of 16, please do not submit any personal information
                        through our Websites or Services. We encourage parents
                        and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet
                        usage and to help enforce this Privacy Statement by
                        instructing their children never to provide personal
                        information through the Websites or Services without
                        their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
                        child under the age of 16 has provided personal
                        information to us through the Websites or Services,
                        please contact us at

                        and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to

11. Changes to this Privacy Statement
AIHelp may amend this Privacy Statement from time to
                        time.  Use of information we collect now is subject to
                        the Privacy Statement in effect at the time such
                        information is used.  If we make changes in the way we
                        use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting

and privacy.
Privacy is at the center of everything we do.
Apple Search Ads has been built from the ground up to respect privacy. Our advertising platform is designed to protect users’ information and give them control over how we use it for advertising.
No user tracking or
data sharing
Apple Search Ads doesn’t buy or share users’ personal information with other companies. We don’t track people by linking user or device data collected from Apple apps with user or device data collected from third parties for advertising targeting or measurement. And we don’t share user or device data with data brokers.
Users’ Apple Pay transactions, Health app data, and HomeKit app data are not used by Apple Search Ads to deliver ads.
Easy control for users
Users may view and limit the information Apple uses to deliver relevant ads to them, by choosing whether to enable the Personalized Ads setting. They may also choose whether location-based information can be used to determine which ads they see.
More about ad preferences
Minors protected
Apple Search Ads doesn’t serve ads to any user whose Apple Account is registered to a minor under 13 years of age or set up as a Managed Apple Account. Nor do we collect, use, or disclose any information from them.
Apple Search Ads also doesn’t allow explicit targeting of people whose Apple Account is registered to a user under the age of 18.
Safe content
Every app on the App Store goes through a thorough review, as do the assets used to promote it. Only these approved assets can be used in Apple Search Ads campaigns.
Transparency and
disclosure
All ads have an “Ad” mark so customers can identify the ads as paid placements. They can tap this mark to see the information used to serve the ad.
How we connect customers and advertisers.
Apple Search Ads empowers advertisers, while protecting individuals.
Advertisers have the ability to deliver targeted ads to customer segments, which are groups of people with similar characteristics. Each segment must contain at least 5000 people, which ensures that no customer can be individually targeted.
To ensure we deliver the most relevant ads, Apple Search Ads may use the following:
Account Information
This includes the information a customer includes in their Apple Account.
App Store Data
This includes information provided by developers to define and categorize their apps. It also includes insights derived from non-personal historical search terms, App Store downloads, App Store browsing activity, and in-app purchases made through the App Store.
App Transaction Data
This includes historical information about users’ transactions on the App Store, including apps they’ve downloaded and in-app purchases they’ve made.
Contextual Information

Introduction
AppsFlyer provides attribution and marketing analytics services (“
Services
“) that enable advertisers and developers (collectively, “
Customer(s)
“) to: (i) measure and analyze the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by understanding which marketing campaigns contributed to the download/installation of their mobile applications (“
Applications
“) or such other conversion metric (e.g. relaunch of Application); and (ii) measure and analyze certain events and actions within their Application or websites, such as in-app purchases made by End Users (as defined below). The Services also help our Customers identify and protect against fraudulent behavior related to their marketing campaigns.
This Services Privacy Policy describes AppsFlyer’s privacy practices in relation to the information collected from Customers and End Users and received by AppsFlyer when Customers use our Services. This Services Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through use of AppsFlyer’s publicly accessible website or marketing activities, which is described under our Privacy Policy. To view the Privacy Policy, please
click here
. Furthermore, AppsFlyer and its Customers have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by AppsFlyer and their use by Customers (“
Agreement(s)
“). Such Agreements may contain additional obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information. Nothing in this Services Privacy Policy derogates from such additional obligations.
For the purpose of this Services Privacy Policy: (i) any reference to “
End User(s)
” means end users who have interacted with, or viewed, Customer’s advertising and marketing materials, or use or have used Customer’s Applications, websites, products and services; and (ii) any reference to “
AppsFlyer
” “
we
” “
us
” or “
our
” shall mean AppsFlyer Ltd. and its affiliates.
End User Data Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer uses the Services, the following End User information may be received and processed by AppsFlyer (collectively, “
End User Data
”).
“
Technical Information
”: this refers to technical information related to an End User’s mobile device or computer, such as: browser type, device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.
“
Technical Identifiers
”: this refers to various unique identifiers that generally only identify a computer, device, browser or Application. For example, IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices); Google Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique identifiers.
“
Engagement Information
”: this refers to information relating to the Customer’s ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer’s website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyze within their Application or website (e.g. add to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).
While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information (“
PII
“), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such. Within the scope of the engagement between Customers and AppsFlyer, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by AppsFlyer. However, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII. This includes, for example, a Customer using an End User’s email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier. If a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.
Registration Information Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer registers to use the Services, we may collect certain information related to such Customer (“
Registration Information
” and together with the End User Data, “
Customer Data
”), including Customer name and Customer details, billing information and names and contact details of Customer employees and representatives who are using the Services (e.g. email, phone number and address). When a Customer uses the Services, AppsFlyer may also collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Customer is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g. browser type, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Customer (“
Log Data
”).
How Data is Collected
Customer Data may be collected through various methods, including:
When provided voluntarily (e.g. Customer’s Registration Information).
When the Customer integrates AppsFlyer’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Applications, websites and/or ads (“
Collection Technologies
”). For explanations on cookies and similar technologies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.

to establish: (i) matches between devices used by an End User; and (ii) to detect fraud (such matched data and fraud data, collectively, the, “

With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, we use such information to authenticate login to the Services, to communicate with the Customer and to process any payments in connection with the Services. Additionally, we may use: (i) Registration Information to inform Customers of any updates to the Services, including new features and functionalities; and (ii) Log Data to understand how Customers are using the Services so that we may efficiently audit, maintain and improve the Services provided to Customers.
AppsFlyer may use information derived from the aggregation of End User Data and/or Log Data with other data for research and analytics purposes and improvement and marketing of the Services (“

Relationship, Lawful Basis and End User Choices
Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, when processing End User Data in connection with the provision of Services to a Customer, AppsFlyer is deemed a ‘data processor’ while its Customers are deemed ‘data controllers’.
Therefore, End Users should closely review the Privacy Policies of the Applications and websites they use in order to learn about the privacy practices of our Customers.
Where AppsFlyer may be deemed a data controller under the laws of certain jurisdictions (e.g. in connection with its processing of Log Data or Registration Information), AppsFlyer shall comply with all applicable laws related to its status as a data controller and shall only use the data as described in this Services Privacy Policy. With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, the lawful basis AppsFlyer relies on is its need to perform its obligations under the Agreement between AppsFlyer and Customer and on its legitimate interests to maintain, analyze and improve the Services. The laws of certain jurisdictions may provide End Users with various rights in connection with the processing of End User Data, including:
The right to withdraw any previously provided consent;
The right to access certain information about you that we process;
The right to have us correct or update any Personal Information;
The right to have certain Information erased;
The right to have us temporarily block our processing of certain Information;
The right to have Information exported into common machine-readable format;
The right to object to our processing of Information in cases of direct marketing, or when we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis to process your information; and
The right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority.
Where AppsFlyer is deemed a data processor, End Users should contact our Customers to pursue any such legal data subject rights. AppsFlyer will cooperate with its Customers to support and comply with any such data subject rights requests.
Where AppsFlyer is deemed a data controller, End Users may exercise their rights by contacting AppsFlyer at:
privacy@appsflyer.com
. We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe. Please note these rights may be limited in certain circumstances as provided by applicable law. In any event, AppsFlyer provides End Users with the ability to opt-out of being measured by the Services by emailing a request to

6. PAYMENT TERMS
6.1 Fees.
You will pay Branch all fees specified in an Order Form or, if there is no Order Form executed by the Parties, then you will pay the fees set forth at the applicable rates available at
https://branch.io/pricing/
, or its successor URL (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, including Fees that remain due and payable after expiration or termination of the Agreement, or any portion thereof. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or where expressly set forth in an applicable Order Form, (i) payment obligations are non-cancelable, Fees are non-refundable, and failure to use the Services provisioned does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay Fees, and (ii) Services purchased cannot be decreased during the service period for which they were purchased.
6.2 Payments & Invoicing.
To the extent you procure the Services with an applicable Order Form, invoices for the applicable Fees shall be sent to you via email to the email address(es) you designate in your account when signing up for Services, and you shall pay the Fees due upon receipt of such invoice. To the extent you procure the Services under an applicable Order Form, any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All Fees set forth in an applicable Order Form shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated therein. Fees are payable in United States dollars. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from your financial institution and intermediary banks. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
6.3 Payment by Credit Card.
In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
6.4 Payment Disputes.
If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
6.5 Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration.
Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees thirty (30) days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or canceling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
6.6 Taxes.
Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "Taxes"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
6.7 Withholding Taxes.
In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("
Withholding Tax
"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
6.8 Overdue Charges.
If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form. You are prohibited from creating new accounts until the Fees due are paid in full.
6.9 Term for Paid Services.
Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either Party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.
7. TERMINATION

Branch Acceptable Use Policy
will be considered a material breach of this Agreement. Termination by Branch for material breach of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured. If Branch terminates this Agreement for material breach, then all of Customer’s outstanding balances and any other unpaid payment obligations will become immediately due and payable by Customer in full. Except as otherwise expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable, and Branch will have no further obligations or liability to you or any third-party as a result of such suspension or discontinuance. Except where there are any Order Form(s) in effect, Branch may terminate your use of the Services without prior notice for any reason at any time by providing you with written notice.
7.2 Termination by Customer.
Except where you have agreed to be bound for a defined service period in any applicable Order Form, you may terminate your access to and use of the Services at any time by providing written notice to Branch via the “Submit a Ticket” function at

https://branch.io/pricing/
, or its successor URL (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Services, or any portion thereof.

Except as expressly provided in an applicable Order Form, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed for the term of the Order Form.
6.2 Payments & Invoicing
. To the extent you procure the Services with an applicable Order Form(s), invoices for the applicable Fees shall be sent to you via email to the email address(es) you designate in your account when signing up for Services, and you shall pay the Fees due upon receipt of such invoice. To the extent you procure the Services under an applicable Order Form, any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All Fees set forth in an applicable Order Form shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated therein. Fees are payable in United States dollars.

6.3 Payment by Credit Card
. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.

6.5 Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
.

6.8 Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.

. You shall pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form or, if there is no Order Form executed by the Parties, you shall pay the fees set forth at the applicable rates available at
https://branch.io/pricing/
, or its successor URL (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Services, or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in an applicable Order Form, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed for the term of the Order Form.
6.2 Payments & Invoicing
. To the extent you procure the Services with an applicable Order Form(s), invoices for the applicable Fees shall be sent to you via email to the email address(es) you designate in your account when signing up for Services, and you shall pay the Fees due upon receipt of such invoice. To the extent you procure the Services under an applicable Order Form, any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All Fees set forth in an applicable Order Form shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated therein. Fees are payable in United States dollars. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from Your financial institution and intermediary banks.

6.3 Payment by Credit Card
. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
6.4 Payment Disputes
. If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
6.5 Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
. Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or canceling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.

Taxes
"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
6.7 Withholding Taxes

6.8 Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.

PAID SERVICE TERMS
Top
Fees
. You will pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Agreement or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in the Agreement, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed up to the effective date of termination.
Payments & Invoicing
. Any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All charges shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from Your financial institution and intermediary banks. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Payment by Credit Card
. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
Payment Disputes
. If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
. Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
Taxes
. Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "
Taxes
"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
Withholding Taxes
. In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("
Withholding Tax
"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.
Term for Paid Services
. Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.
Termination by Branch
. Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable. Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the date Branch provides written notice to you of such violation. Termination by Branch for your violation of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured.

PAID SERVICE TERMS
Fees
. You will pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Agreement or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in the Agreement, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed up to the effective date of termination.
Payments & Invoicing
. Any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All charges shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from Your financial institution and intermediary banks. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Payment by Credit Card
. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
Payment Disputes
. If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
. Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
Taxes
. Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "
Taxes
"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
Withholding Taxes
. In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("
Withholding Tax
"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.
Term for Paid Services
. Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.
Termination by Branch
. Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable. Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the date Branch provides written notice to you of such violation. Termination by Branch for your violation of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured. Upon termination of the Agreement, any outstanding balance through the effective date of termination and other unpaid payment obligations will be immediately due and payable in full.
TERMINATION
Except with respect to paid services, as to which the terms and conditions governing termination are set forth above in the section "PAID SERVICE TERMS" of these Terms above, You acknowledge and agree that Branch, in its sole discretion, may terminate your use of the Services without prior notice for any reason at any time.

PAID SERVICE TERMS
Fees
. You will pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Agreement or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in the Agreement, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed up to the effective date of termination.
Payments & Invoicing
. Any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All charges shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from Your financial institution and intermediary banks. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Payment by Credit Card
. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
Payment Disputes
. If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
. Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
Taxes
. Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "
Taxes
"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
Withholding Taxes
. In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("
Withholding Tax
"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.
Term for Paid Services
. Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.
Termination by Branch
. Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable. Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the date Branch provides written notice to you of such violation. Termination by Branch for your violation of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured. Upon termination of the Agreement, any outstanding balance through the effective date of termination and other unpaid payment obligations will be immediately due and payable in full.

ONBOARDING SERVICE ASSUMPTIONS.
Unless otherwise noted in this SOW or agreed to in writing by the Parties, the following assumptions are based on information provided by the Customer relating to the Project and have been used to estimate Branch PS’s required time, level of effort, and fees. Deviations from these assumptions may lead to commensurate changes in the timeline and fees and will be handled through a formal Change Order.
Term Length:
Unless otherwise agreed upon by both Parties and executed in a Change Order, the obligation of Branch to provide Onboarding Services under this SOW expires after the timeframe identified in the Order Form, following the SOW “Effective Date.”
Reasonable Work Hours:
Customer agrees that (1) Branch PS staffing commitments (“Staffing Commitments”) include up to the amount set forth in the Order Form (if any); (2) Staffing Commitments in this SOW may not have been fully scoped, and there is no assurance that the work identified by the Customer for Branch PS subject to Staffing Commitments can be completed within the time period scoped or even that such work can be completed at all; (3) Branch PS reserves the right to reject any request for work identified by Customer to be provided by Branch PS as Staffing Commitments, if Branch PS reasonably believes such work is outside of the type of services normally provided by Branch PS; and (4) Staffing Commitments may be consumed by Branch PS in completing preparations for meetings, completing offline research, and completing offline configurations or other action items.

Branch PS will secure Customer’s approval to bill against overages that exceed initial Staffing Commitments or arising from delays caused by Customer before the provisioning of any such overage services.

CUSTOMER RESOURCE AVAILABILITY.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Branch PS team’s performance is contingent upon Customer’s timely performance of its obligations under this SOW. Project timeline estimates provided by Branch PS are dependent on the availability of Customer resources and key decision makers. Lack of access to, or any material change to, Customer’s resources and/or Project stakeholders may impact estimated timelines, costs, fees, and whether additional Onboarding Services may be needed. As such, Customer agrees to promptly: (a) acknowledge, review, and respond to communications from Branch PS to support and progress the Project; (b) sign or e-sign any documents necessary to enable integration features with third-party partners selected by Customer to enable Branch PS to continue the provisioning of the Onboarding Services; connect the Branch PS team with Customer’s relevant contacts and subject matter experts as may be necessary to facilitate the Onboarding Services. Should Customer choose not to go live with any aspect of the deployment, and then at a future date need additional Onboarding Services, this will require another statement of work or Change Order to extend the Onboarding Services term and may result in additional costs. Customer is solely responsible for its engagement with and management of any third-party vendors that Customer integrates into, or uses in conjunction with, Branch.

Additional Customer resources as needed to support the scope of the Project
IV. ONBOARDING
SERVICE ASSUMPTIONS.
Unless otherwise noted in this SOW or agreed to in writing by the Parties, the following assumptions are based on information provided by the Customer relating to the Project and have been used to estimate Branch OS’s required level of effort and fees. Deviations from these assumptions may lead to commensurate changes in the timeline and fees and will be handled through a formal Change Order.
Term Length
: Unless otherwise agreed upon by both Parties and duly executed in writing, the obligation of Branch to provide Onboarding Services under this SOW expires after the timeframe identified in the Order Form, following the SOW “Effective Date.”
Scope:
Any item or activity not specifically included within the scope of this SOW is deemed outside the scope of this SOW and may require a Change Order, or separate SOW. Services referenced herein are in support of standard Branch software functionality as defined by the applicable Service Agreement, except as may otherwise be specified in this SOW. Any changes to the software functionality supplied are outside the scope of this SOW.
No Recording
: Customer will not film or record Branch delivery of Onboarding Services or Branch materials.
Reasonable Work Hours
: Customer agrees that:
Branch OS staffing commitments (“Staffing Commitments”) include up to the amount set forth in the Order Form (if any);
Staffing Commitments in this SOW may not have been fully scoped, and there is no assurance that the work identified by the Customer for Branch OS subject to Staffing Commitments can be completed within the time period scoped or even that such work can be completed at all;
Branch OS reserves the right to reject any request for work identified by Customer to be provided by Branch OS as Staffing Commitments, if Branch OS reasonably believes such work is outside of the type of services normally provided by Branch OS; and
Staffing Commitments may be consumed by Branch OS in completing preparations for meetings, completing offline research, and completing offline configurations or other action items.
Overages
: Branch OS will secure Customer’s approval to bill against overages that exceed initial Staffing Commitments before the provisioning of any such overage services.
Cancellation / Postponement
: Branch OS and Customer will use commercially reasonable efforts to attend all scheduled Project meetings. The repeated cancelation of Project meetings may result in Project delay and additional costs.
Business Hours
: Branch OS resources will be reachable over email during normal business hours (9 am - 6 pm local time, Monday – Friday, excluding nationally recognized holidays), and issues escalated outside of normal business hours may be sent to support@branch.io.
Non-Solicitation
: During the term of the SOW and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, Customer shall not interfere with Branch’s relationship with, or endeavor to entice away from Branch, any person who, on the date of the termination of or expiration of the Agreement, was an employee of Branch.
V. CUSTOMER RESOURCE AVAILABILITY.
Project timeline estimates provided by Branch OS are dependent on the availability of Customer resources and key decision makers. Lack of access to or the material change to resources and/or Project stakeholders may impact estimated timelines and whether additional Onboarding Services may be needed. Customer is responsible for acknowledging, reviewing, and responding to communications from Branch OS to support this Project. Some integration features may require Customer’s contractual signature / e-signature with a third party before Branch OS can continue with the provisioning of services, and Customer is responsible for responding and executing such third party agreements in a timely and collaborative fashion. Customer is responsible for any engagement and management of third-party vendors that Customer uses in conjunction with Branch. Customer will provide relevant contacts and subject matter experts in a timely fashion to be made available for any necessary work to conduct this SOW according to a mutually agreed upon Project schedule. Should Customer choose not to go live with any aspect of the deployment, and then at a future date need additional Onboarding Services, this will require another statement of work or Change Order to extend the Onboarding Services term and may result in additional costs.
VI. CHANGE ORDERS.
Changes to a SOW or Order Form will require a written Change Order signed by the Parties prior to implementation of the changes. Such changes many include, for example, changes to the scope of work and any corresponding changes to the estimated fees and schedule.
VII. FEES.
Customer will pay Branch for the Onboarding Services at the rates specified in the applicable Order Form.
VIII. LICENSES PROCUREMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
Any rights for Customer to use and access Branch software (including without limitation any service functionalities, products, modules and features) are outside the scope of this SOW and must be separately procured by Customer from Branch pursuant to an Order Form or the applicable Service Agreement.
Customer is responsible for separately procuring, at its own expense, all necessary rights for its and/or Branch OS’s use of any Customer or third-party technology that will be used within the scope of this SOW, including any applications and/or services with which the Branch Service can be connected through integrations. Customer represents and warrants that it will procure all such rights prior to using or permitting Branch OS’s use of any such third-party technology hereunder. Customer acknowledges that use of third-party technology and/or services not already licensed or purchased by Customer may require additional licenses and fee(s) that must be obtained separately by the Customer from the specific third-party provider of such applications and/or services.
IX. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Customer will retain all right, title, and interest in and to any materials provided to Branch OS and the Branch OS resources pursuant to this SOW (“Customer Materials”).  Customer grants Branch (including Branch OS) and its contractors a worldwide, non-exclusive, right to use, copy, distribute, create derivative works based on, display, and perform its Customer Materials as reasonably necessary for Branch OS to provide the Onboarding Services and Services to Customer.
Except for the rights granted in this Section, and subject to Customer’s rights in the Customer Materials, Branch owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to the Work Product.  Branch grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Work Product with the Services for Customer’s internal business purposes during the Term of the applicable Service Agreement.
Customer will not (and will not allow any third party to): (a) remove or alter proprietary notices from the Work Product or (b) use, sell, copy, modify, create derivative works based on, publicly perform, publicly display, or distribute the Work Product outside of the Services.
X. DISCLAIMER
. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BRANCH AND ITS AFFILIATES (A) MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATORY OR OTHERWISE REGARDING THE ONBOARDING SERVICES AND WORK PRODUCT, AND (B) DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTIES (I) OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OR (II) THAT THE ONBOARDING SERVICES AND WORK PRODUCT ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR RELIABLE.  THE ONBOARDING SERVICES AND WORK PRODUCT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”  NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE ONBOARDING SERVICES AND WORK PRODUCT WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE IN THIS SOW.
XI. TERM AND TERMINATION
Term.
This SOW will expire or terminate in accordance with the Section on “Term Length” above.
Termination for Cause.
Either party may terminate this SOW if the other party is in material breach of the SOW and fails to cure that breach within thirty days after receipt of written notice.  Any termination of the applicable Service Agreement will also terminate this SOW.
Surviving Provisions.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 18).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s Services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment. In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels, and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

As part of Branch’s Services, Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor) that have partnered with Branch to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf in connection with the measurement and analysis of the Client's marketing campaigns.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti- fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 18).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s Services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment. In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels, and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti- fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion

of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 18).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s Services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment. In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels, and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

As part of Branch’s Services, Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor) that have partnered with Branch to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf in connection with the measurement and analysis of the Client's marketing campaigns.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti- fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 18).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s Services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment. In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels, and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti- fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Dashboard Information:
Information we collect from visitors who register for an account on our dashboard includes the following, some of which is considered Personal Data under applicable law:When a Client creates an account and uses the Services, Branch may collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Client is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g., browser type and version, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Client (“Log Data”).
We also require Clients to set up a user ID and unique password for account security purposes. Clients must not disclose their passwords to anyone. Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts. We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with promotional emails. We offer a mechanism to opt out from promotional emails as described in the “Opt-Out from Promotional Emails” section below.

To the extent that we charge a fee for the Services, we may also collect limited billing, payment, and contract information from Clients through our payment and contract vendors.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data.

of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.

Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking,
which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.  For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process;
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”).
Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "
Branch
", "
us
", "
our
" or "
we
") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Top
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:
Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking

. This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer read or set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself). Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

Client App Opt-out Controls:
Branch‘s
SDK Privacy Controls
allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
Engagement Builder:
Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.

.
Our Data Retention Policy
Top
For our Services:
Branch stores the information collected by our Services (see the “What Information Does Branch Collect from our Services?” section above) so long as our systems continue to encounter that User. After that User has been inactive for 30 days (or 90 days for specific attribution products), identifiers collected from that User will be deleted unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Usage activity logs, which are used for the purpose of reporting and analytics, are stored in an identifiable form for no more than 7 days (or up to 60 days as determined by the Client or for specific fields), after which these logs are removed or pseudonymized. Any and all pseudonymized logs are deleted after 12 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Aggregated reporting metrics disclosed to Clients are retained (in aggregate and anonymized form) for up to 24 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Branch may retain information collected by our Services beyond these periods for fraud prevention, analysis, or response, or to protect the safety of Branch, its Clients, Users or the public.
For the Website:
We store Personal Data such as email address or billing details for so long as you continue to have a business relationship with Branch and for a reasonable time thereafter for record-keeping purposes. If applicable to you, you may ask us to delete that information as described in the “Data Subject Rights” section below or pursuant to your right of erasure as described in the “Data Subject Rights” section below.
Links to Other Websites
Top
The Website and/or Services may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Website and/or Services. These other domains and websites are not controlled by Branch, and we do not endorse or make any representations about websites or social media platforms operated by other parties.

International Data Transfers
Top
All information collected via the Website and Services is stored on servers located in the United States. In the process of providing the Services, we may transfer information across borders from other countries or jurisdictions into the United States. Data protection laws in the United States may differ from your country, and the data Branch processes may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.
Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States
Top
Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov
.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union, UK, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Branch at:

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "
Branch
", "
us
", "
our
" or "
we
") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Top
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:

Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

Our Data Retention Policy
Top
For our Services:
Branch stores the information collected by our Services (see the “What Information Does Branch Collect from our Services?” section above) so long as our systems continue to encounter that User. After that User has been inactive for 30 days (or 90 days for specific attribution products), identifiers collected from that User will be deleted unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Usage activity logs, which are used for the purpose of reporting and analytics, are stored in an identifiable form for no more than 7 days (or up to 60 days as determined by the Client or for specific fields), after which these logs are removed or pseudonymized. Any and all pseudonymized logs are deleted after 12 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Aggregated reporting metrics disclosed to Clients are retained (in aggregate and anonymized form) for up to 24 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Branch may retain information collected by our Services beyond these periods for fraud prevention, analysis, or response, or to protect the safety of Branch, its Clients, Users or the public.
For the Website:
We store Personal Data such as email address or billing details for so long as you continue to have a business relationship with Branch and for a reasonable time thereafter for record-keeping purposes. If applicable to you, you may ask us to delete that information as described in the “Data Subject Rights” section below or pursuant to your right of erasure as described in the “Data Subject Rights” section below.

International Data Transfers
Top
All information collected via the Website and Services is stored on servers located in the United States. In the process of providing the Services, we may transfer information across borders from other countries or jurisdictions into the United States. Data protection laws in the United States may differ from your country, and the data Branch processes may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.
Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States
Top
Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov
.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union, UK, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Branch at:

Branch has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "
Branch
", "
us
", "
our
" or "
we
") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Top
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:

Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

Our Data Retention Policy
Top
For our Services:
Branch stores the information collected by our Services (see the “What Information Does Branch Collect from our Services?” section above) so long as our systems continue to encounter that User. After that User has been inactive for 30 days (or 90 days for specific attribution products), identifiers collected from that User will be deleted unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Usage activity logs, which are used for the purpose of reporting and analytics, are stored in an identifiable form for no more than 7 days (or up to 60 days as determined by the Client or for specific fields), after which these logs are removed or pseudonymized. Any and all pseudonymized logs are deleted after 12 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Aggregated reporting metrics disclosed to Clients are retained (in aggregate and anonymized form) for up to 24 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Branch may retain information collected by our Services beyond these periods for fraud prevention, analysis, or response, or to protect the safety of Branch, its Clients, Users or the public.

We store Personal Data such as email address or billing details for so long as you continue to have a business relationship with Branch and for a reasonable time thereafter for record-keeping purposes.

International Data Transfers
Top
All information collected via the Website and Services is stored on servers located in the United States. In the process of providing the Services, we may transfer information across borders from other countries or jurisdictions into the United States. Data protection laws in the United States may differ from your country, and the data Branch processes may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.
Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States
Top
Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov
.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union, UK, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Branch at:
Branch Metrics, Inc.
195 Page Mill Road, Suite 101
Palo Alto, CA 94306
or by email at

Branch has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this    summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or            websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch        customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s        end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can        request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end        user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated    above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed    to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so    that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. (
"Branch"
,
"us"
,
"our"
or
"we"
) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of    devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to    derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes    and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our    services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This        section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website        located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the        parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information    we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way    that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of    Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a    wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions    across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so    that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the    Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to    provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are    provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links,    pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using    the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution    techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these    attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform,    creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and    identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data    parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well    as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases,    these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users    with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s        connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a                specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download                the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics        metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client        directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that                downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific                link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a                tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have                interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services        we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new        products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our        Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure        more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by        law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the    data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject    to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to    understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union    ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as    the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European    Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield    inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with    respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If    there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy    Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of    the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform    EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be    required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to    meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access    their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to    exercise this right may do so by contacting

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. (
"Branch"
,
"us"
,
"our"
or
"we"
) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Top
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:
Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking

Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

SDK Privacy Controls
allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
Engagement Builder:
Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.

International Data Transfers
Top
All information collected via the Website and Services is stored on servers located in the United States. In the process of providing the Services, we may transfer information across borders from other countries or jurisdictions into the United States. Data protection laws in the United States may differ from your country, and the data Branch processes may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.
Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States

Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov
.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting
privacy@branch.io
.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union, UK, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Branch at:

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. You’ll find our official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from sharing with Branch any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Our customers can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell personal data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with GDPR requirements as well.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. (
"Branch"
,
"us"
,
"our"
or
"we"
) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from service providers and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to share with Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to infer that certain browsers and devices are operated by the same User based upon connections Branch has derived across non-affiliated apps and websites.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or third parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and share these reports with the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Top
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:
Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking

Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

SDK Privacy Controls
allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
Engagement Builder:
Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.

For our Services:
Branch stores the information collected by our Services (see the “What Information Does Branch Collect from our Services?” section above) so long as our systems continue to encounter that User. After that User has been inactive for 30 days (or 90 days for specific attribution products), identifiers collected from that User will be deleted unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Usage activity logs, which are used for the purpose of reporting and analytics, are stored in an identifiable form for no more than 7 days (or up to 60 days as determined by the Client or for specific fields), after which these logs are removed or pseudonymized. Any and all pseudonymized logs are deleted after 12 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Aggregated reporting metrics shared with Clients are retained (in aggregate and anonymized form) for up to 24 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Branch may retain information collected by our Services beyond these periods for fraud prevention, analysis, or response, or to protect the safety of Branch, its Clients, Users or the public.

By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.
Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States

Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit visit

Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to agent third parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

Privacy Policy

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. You’ll find our official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from sharing with Branch any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Our customers can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell personal data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with GDPR requirements as well.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Branch Metrics, Inc. (
"Branch"
,
"us"
,
"our"
or
"we"
) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from service providers and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to share with Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites.

Information Collected By Third Parties
As part of Branch’s Services, Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor) to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to infer that certain browsers and devices are operated by the same User based upon connections Branch has derived across non-affiliated apps and websites.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or third parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and share these reports with the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:
Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking

Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

SDK Privacy Controls
allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
Engagement Builder:
Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.

Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States
Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov
.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to agent third parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union, UK, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Branch at:
Branch Metrics, Inc.
195 Page Mill Road, Suite 101
Palo Alto, CA 94306
or by email at privacy@branch.io

If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers

privacy@branch.io
. Depending on your country of residence, you may also raise any questions or concerns you have regarding your personal information with your local data protection authority.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
You may also have certain rights regarding your personal information. Subject to certain exceptions, you may request:
access to your personal information including the right to obtain confirmation that we are processing your personal information and the right to know the categories of personal information we have or will collect about you and the reason we will or have collected such information;
correction of the personal information that we have or will hold about you that is inaccurate;
deletion or removal of your personal information.
Exceptions to Your Rights: There are certain exceptions to these rights. For instance, we may retain your personal information if it is reasonably necessary for us or our service providers to provide a service that you have requested or to comply with law or to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity.
You also have the right not to be discriminated against (as provided for in California law) for exercising your rights.
We also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request. In doing so, we may ask you for verification information so that we can match at least two verification points with information we maintain in our files about you.

You can have an authorized representative make the request on your behalf, and they will need to also provide verification of identity.
California law also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the California Consumer Privacy Act.
California law places certain obligations on businesses that “sell” personal information to third parties or “share” personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. We do not “sell” or “share” the personal information covered by this Policy and have not done so in the twelve months prior to the effective date of this Policy.
ADHERENCE TO BRANCH POLICIES
Anyone who is hired by Branch will be required to adhere to all Branch policies, where consistent with applicable local law.

Supplier Code of Conduct
Introduction
This Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”) has been established to summarize Branch's  core values and expected standards of conduct for its vendors, contractors, consulting firms, staffing agencies, agency temps, partners, licensees and other intermediaries and their respective employees and affiliates (collectively, “Suppliers” or “you”) to comply with when working with Branch. All Suppliers shall promote a safe, diverse, lawful and respectful work environment. We believe that this Supplier Code will reinforce those qualities and attributes that have made both Branch and you successful.
Suppliers are expected to review, understand and comply with the policies set forth in this Supplier Code. The Supplier Code should be viewed as the minimum standards that we expect and is not intended in any way to lessen your contractual obligations with Branch. Failure to comply with this Supplier Code may result in Branch’s review of its engagement with a Supplier and may result in termination of Supplier’s relationship with Branch.
This Supplier Code and all policies contained herein will be administered in accordance with applicable law and may be updated from time to time. If you have questions about this Supplier Code, you can contact Branch at
legal@branch.io
.
Compliance with Rules, Laws, and Regulations
Suppliers are expected to comply with all applicable rules, laws, and regulations at all times while working with Branch. You have a responsibility to be knowledgeable about specific laws and regulations that apply to your area of business. If a law conflicts with this Supplier Code, you must comply with the law.
Diversity and
Non-Discrimination
Diversity is at the forefront of Branch’s mission and culture. We are and remain committed to being a globally diverse, ethical, moral and inclusive company that is tolerant of all individuals from all different backgrounds because we believe the best ideas come from a diverse way of looking at technology and the world.
Accordingly, Suppliers shall provide an environment free from unlawful discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics, such as age, race, religion, national origin, caste, ancestry, disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, pregnancy, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other basis protected by applicable law. Additionally, we expect all Suppliers to promote working environments where all individuals are entitled to equal opportunities and fair treatment.
Anti-Harassment
Each Supplier shall ensure its workplace is free of harassment. Harassment means any verbal, physical, and visual conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile working environment or that interferes with an individual’s work performance. Harassing conduct can take many forms and may include, but is not limited to, the following: slurs, jokes, statements, gestures, assault, impeding or blocking another’s movement or otherwise physically interfering with normal work, or sharing inappropriate materials.
Non-Retaliation
No Supplier will retaliate against an individual for filing a good faith complaint of unlawful discrimination or harassment or for participating in any good faith investigation of alleged discrimination or harassment.
Conflicts of Interest
Branch expects all Suppliers to avoid conflicts of interest and to operate with the highest level of ethics and integrity. A potential conflict of interest, or the appearance of one, occurs when your outside interests (for example, financial or personal interests) interfere with or influence, or even just appear to interfere with or influence, yours or Branch’s business interests or your work-related duties.
Suppliers may give and accept common courtesy items that are of modest cost, provided for legitimate business purposes and are understood as customary in Supplier’s industry. However, Suppliers must refrain from giving or accepting any gifts or other items with an intent to influence Branch, its customers, prospects, agents, employees or representatives or to obtain an improper business advantage, or in exchange for favors or benefits.
Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery
Branch Supplier's are strictly prohibited from partaking in any and all forms of corruption and bribery, including, but not limited to, payment or receipt of bribes or kickbacks to or from foreign or domestic government employees or officials, representatives of commercial enterprises or any other persons, whether made directly or through others such as agents, consultants or other associated parties. Suppliers will take all necessary steps to ensure that corruption and bribery do not occur in its business activities, wherever those business activities may take place. Violations of this nature may result in the termination of Supplier's partnership with Branch and may also lead to civil and criminal penalties.
Suppliers will also ensure their compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other applicable laws that prohibit unlawful activities to procure a business advantage.
Antitrust
Suppliers shall refrain from engaging in any and all acts which are or may be considered counter to antitrust and fair competition legislation and regulations. Additionally, Branch expects its Suppliers to promote a free, open and competitive marketplace by avoiding all forms of anti-competitive acts or collusion. Suppliers’ responsibilities under this section shall apply wherever a Supplier conducts business.
Confidential Information, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property
Our customers, partners and employees entrust us to safeguard their confidential information with the utmost security. As follows, Branch expects all of its Suppliers to protect confidential information and trade secrets regarding Branch and its business practices. Branch confidential information should only be used in accordance with existing confidentiality obligations for authorized purposes, disclosed on a need-to-know basis, and subject to separate written confidentiality obligations. Similarly, intellectual property including, but not limited to trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, logos, and other inventions, belonging to Branch, shall be handled with the appropriate level of care and preserved to the extent legally permissible. We encourage all Suppliers to regularly review their confidentiality practices.
In the event Supplier controls or processes personal information and/or personal data as defined under applicable data protection laws, Suppliers must ensure that their control and processing of such information and data is in accordance with applicable data protection laws, rules, statutes, and regulations. Suppliers are expected to maintain a privacy policy describing its privacy practices and handling of personal information.
Healthy Workplace and Labor Practices
Branch Suppliers must provide all employees with safe and healthy workplace conditions that comply with all applicable laws.
Suppliers will also refrain from engaging or attempting to engage in any and all forms of child labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking in violation of all applicable laws.
Environmental Protection
Branch Suppliers shall conduct their business and operations in such a manner that is respectful, responsible and protective of the environment. At a minimum, Suppliers shall comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and standards. Whenever possible, Branch encourages its Suppliers to continually review their internal operations in order to reduce waste, promote clean air initiatives, and conserve resources.
International Trade and Export Controls
Branch expects Suppliers to comply with all applicable import, export, customs, sanctions, embargoes, boycott and other trade compliance laws and regulations during the entirety of Branch and Supplier’s engagement.
Accurate and Complete Books and Records
All Suppliers must maintain accurate records of all transactions and ensure that the Supplier’s books and records accurately and fairly reflect, with appropriate detail, all transactions, expenses, or other dispositions of assets with regard to its business with Branch. No Supplier employee or other worker shall falsify or otherwise mislead Branch with regard to any records or books Supplier maintains.
Reporting Breaches of this Policy
Compliance with this Supplier Code is, first and foremost, the personal responsibility of Suppliers, including every individual employed by Supplier. All personnel are encouraged to report, in person or in writing, any known or suspected violations of this Supplier Code to Branch at
legal@branch.io
. Any questions or violation reports will be addressed promptly.
Branch will not tolerate any retaliation by Supplier against any individual who acts in good faith in reporting any violation of this Supplier Code. Supplier will investigate reported violations and will determine an appropriate response, including corrective action and preventive measures, and will include Branch in this process at its request.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF

certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring
:
Enable Opt-in Monitoring

configure Analytics data collection
.
Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase Realtime Database
Cloud Storage for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Firebase Test Lab
Firebase App Check
Firebase App Distribution
Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data

during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.

Our Privacy Principles for the use of data about Targeted End Users
Liftoff’s systems aggregate events/data at granularities that cover many users, as opposed to a specific user, unless the user consents. For instance: users with iPhone X’s in San Francisco have clicked on ads in app A 100 times and installed app B 50 times.
Liftoff does not tie together events/data across apps in a user-specific way, without the user’s consent. For instance: we do not track that a person did X in app A and also Y in app B from a different publisher, if the person opts-out of interest-based advertising.
Instead, Liftoff only ties events/data from a given specific user within the context of a given app. E.g. user with app-local ID 123 installed app A, then finished the tutorial, then made a purchase.
This allows Liftoff to understand the conversion rates from one event to another within an app, but not track the activities of a user across different apps.
Liftoff does not record or store personal information that the user cannot easily revoke, such as email address, physical address, photographs or phone number to personalize our advertising. Liftoff relies upon device IDs to uniquely identify a user, and Liftoff solely relies upon the user’s consent in allowing Liftoff to access this information.
Liftoff does not export per-user data outside of Liftoff, except for validation purposes to a company that already has access to that data

V. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Your personal information may be collected, transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located, including the United States and other countries where we or our group companies or service providers (among others) maintain facilities. Our group affiliates and our third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. We maintain primary data centers in the United States, Singapore, Japan and Germany. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Privacy Policy and according to applicable law.
We have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, including by entering into the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal information, or where required, we will ask you for your prior written consent for such international data transfers.
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland which have been formally recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” and “adequacy regulations” from the European Commission, Swiss and UK authorities.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision, we take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. These safeguards include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021 under Article 46(2) GDPR for transfers originating in the EEA, UK and Switzerland; and the UK Addendum under Article 46(2) of the UK GDPR for the transfer of data originating in the UK.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses entered into by our group companies and with our third-party service providers and partners can be provided on request. Please note that some sensitive commercial information will be redacted. If you have any questions or concerns related to international data transfers, please contact us via the contact details set out below.

Information about the types of third parties to which we disclose personal information and the purposes for which we do so is described in Section VI titled “How we share your personal information and who we share it with”.

If you are located in the EEA, UK (inc. Gibraltar) or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the personal information that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the DPF Principles.

VI. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHO WE SHARE IT WITH
We do not sell your personal information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we do share your personal information with third parties as described below. If you have consented to us sharing your personal information but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.
Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You will be able to recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is necessary and related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies. This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information that we collect through the Site and Services. If you have any questions about these practices, please contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
Service Providers
We employ third party companies and people, for example cloud service providers (“Third Party Service Providers”), such as Amazon Web Services, Dropbox, Salesforce and
Unity Technologies
to perform tasks e.g., provide computer and network infrastructure services on our behalf or as advertising exchange partners and we may need to share your information with them to provide products or Services to you. We only share your personal information with Third Party Service Providers to the extent necessary for them to assist us and they do not have any right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We may also work with Google to deliver the best advertising opportunities to its clients through the use of remarketing tags. Traffic Clients and other data subjects can consult Google’s policies to learn more about Google’s processing policies
here
.
Third Party Digital Advertising Partners
If you are a Targeted End User, we will share data about you with Partners, to be used by those Partners for advertising-related purposes, including establishing (on behalf of advertisers) whether to bid on the opportunity to show you ads. When we share data in this manner, we will also share with the relevant Partner details about whether you have consented to, or objected to, the use of your data by the Partner for specified purposes.
Group Companies
We may provide your personal information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf to provide the Site and the Services to you. These parties are required to process such information based on our instructions and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. They do not have any independent right to share this information.
Compliance with laws and legal proceedings
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
Merger or Acquisition
If Liftoff Mobile, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
VII. SECURITY
The security of your personal information is important to us.  Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us
We take appropriate steps to pseudonymize your personal information. For Targeted End Users, the advertising device IDs (which are the only per-user identifiers that we track, and can be reset by the user at any time) are SHA1-hashed before insertion. Since SHA1 is a one-way hashing algorithm, the original raw advertising device ID cannot be reverse-engineered from the hashed version.
If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
VIII. DATA RETENTION
If you have provided us with personal information for the purposes of holding an account with us, we will retain your information (including personal information) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.
If we hold information about you through any other means we shall only process this information for as long as is necessary for the purpose and in any event for no longer than 28 days.
Information relating to Targeted End Users is retained for 30 days in pseudonymized form before it is automatically deleted from our active database. Backups are stored indefinitely.
We will delete it after the timescales stated above, except we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
IX. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
We perform the following automated decision-making processes using your personal information:
To build lookalike targeting models to target users who are similar to the Customer’s existing users. Our Machine Learning does this automatically for every Customer. The more upfront device IDs Liftoff has, the more beneficial this is.
For power predictive ML features e.g. users who have purchased in the past are much more likely to purchase again in the future
To exclude existing users from User Acquisition campaigns, and power targeting rules for re-engagement campaigns e.g. target users who have registered but not purchased.
We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal data is subject to automated decision-making. Our technical and organizational security measures can be provided on request.
When we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contacting us using the contact details provided under Section IV titled “Complaints, Questions and Suggestions”.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:
X is a public platform
Learn what’s viewable & searchable
We collect some data
about you

Affiliate services may have their own policies

We use your data to make X better

10. How To Contact X
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us.
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
Personal Accounts.
If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
Professional Accounts.
If you create a
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.
Payment Information.
In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
Preferences.
When you set your preferences using your
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
Biometric Information.
Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.
Job Applications / Recommendations.
We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your activity on X, including:
Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.
We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).
Purchase and payments.
To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
Device Information.
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:
Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.
Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.
Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information.
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.
Inferred Identity.
We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:
When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.
When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.
Log Information.
We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:
IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identiﬁers; and identiﬁers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.
Advertisements.
When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).
Cookies and similar technologies.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.
3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether
videos you upload
are downloadable by others.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates
and third-party partners and
service providers
located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.
X is a
participant
in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us
here
. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body
JAMS
, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in
Annex 1
to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF
