CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
Personal Information: Eyezy App collects “Personal Information” from you at various times
							and
							places on the Site and Eyezy Application. Personal Information means information relating to
							a
							particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, email address, and
							telephone number. Personal Information also includes your “Children’s Personal Information,”
							as
							defined below.
Children’s Personal Information: With your consent, We may collect your “Children’s Personal
							Information.” Children’s Personal Information may include information you voluntarily submit
							to us such as your child’s first, middle and last name, date of birth, age, gender, and
							profile photo, or it may include information we collect from your child as a result of your
							use of the Services, such as your child’s contacts data (contact list), your child’s device access times (e.g., we may collect
							information relating to how long your child uses or accesses his or her device to support
							our “allowance” feature), device identifier numbers, serial numbers, geolocation
							information, sound around the child's device, and other internet, device, or electronic
							network activity information,including, but not limited to, encrypted screenshots generated
							by Eyezy Application account and the transcribed content from the screenshots (e.g., through
							optical character recognition), as authorized by you (“Screenshots”). Screenshots may
							capture your children’s browsing activity, search activity, messaging activity, and other
							information regarding your child’s interaction with an internet website, application,
							advertisement, device, or interactions with a device in general.
You as a parent can choose to listen live to your child's device's surroundings or choose
								to record these surroundings for 15 seconds. You can save it in the App and download
								from the App to any data storage. For users from USA: Please note, that this feature is
								available only in US states, where the one-party consent for surroundings recording is
								applied. In other US states the Sound around the child’s device feature is prohibited
								due to local laws and requirements. For users from other countries: It is your
								responsibility to comply with the laws of your country due to Sound around the child’s
								device features usage. In some countries you have to get a consent from third-party
								(individual, which is staying near your kid) for recording surroundings with such
								individual’s participation (conversation, talks, etc.). Please, get an advice of your
								lawyer, how you can legally use the Sound around the child’s device feature in the
								country of your designation.
In order to provide the Services, we may also collect from your child’s device information
							relating to which apps are installed on your child’s device and information relating to your
							child’s device permission status (e.g., if your child has disabled the usage permissions on
							his/her device required to provide the Services, that information may be collected or if the
							device can no longer be “seen”). We may also collect information from your child’s device
							about
							your child’s usage and activity in connection with the Services (e.g., error/crash
							reporting,
							usage analytics such as screen views, your child’s use of any hyperlinks available within
							the
							Services, time on page, and page hits).
The Company cares for the privacy of correspondence and the confidentiality of its users'
							data. The child's messages tracking function operates in strict compliance with the personal
							data legislation. In this regard, we cannot provide access to view messages that your child
							receives from the sender of such messages (from the person with whom the child is
							corresponding). You can only see the messages your child is sending. In addition, we cannot
							show who your child is corresponding with (sender of messages to your child).
For additional information about our practices regarding Children’s Personal Information,
							please see Section 11 (Children’s Privacy).
In regard to the European Union, our collection of personal information from a child is
								limited
								and controlled by the parent.
Non-Personal Information: Non-Personal Information means information that does not identify,
							and
							cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual. We collect Non-Personal Information,
							for
							example, when we track the total number of visitors to the Site, the number of visitors to a
							particular page of the Site, and/or other such technical information. This data may be used
							to
							diagnose problems with the Services, gather demographic and geographic information to
							improve
							our Services or marketing efforts, improve our Services, and for similar purposes.

							use
							and disclose Non-Personal Information in its sole discretion.

							your schedules, your devices’ operating systems, IP address, etc. We analyse this
							information to
							troubleshoot any issues users encountered, to work out how our products are being used and
							how
							to improve them.
If you turn on the location tracking feature on a device, we also collect that device’s
							location
							data, as well as any geo-fence zones you set up. Location data is used solely for the
							delivery
							of the location tracking feature and is deleted from our systems 14 days after it is
