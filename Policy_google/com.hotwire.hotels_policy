Collection and Use of Your Personal Data
In this section, you will find information about:
the types of personal data that we collect and use,
how we collect and use it,
the purposes for which we collect and use it, and
the lawful basis we rely on to collect and use it.
Lawful bases for processing:
In the table below, you will find the lawful bases we rely on to collect and use your personal data.
In summary, whenever we collect or use your personal data, that collection or use must be based on one of the following criteria:
Consent
: this means you have given your consent for us to do so (e.g., sending you marketing communications where consent is required).
Legal obligation:
this means we have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or use it for a specific purpose (e.g. using your transaction history to complete our financial and tax obligations under the law).
Performance of a contract:
this means the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g., manage your booking, process payments, or create an account at your request),
If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data).
Legitimate interest:
this means the processing is in our legitimate interests and those interests are not overridden by your rights (as explained below)
Certain countries and regions allow us to process personal data on the basis of legitimate interests. If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or the legitimate interests of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate or improve our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us, to respond to your queries, to undertake marketing, or for the purpose of  detecting or preventing illegal activities.  Whatever our determination of our specific legitimate interest is for a given use of your personal data, when we assess its appropriateness, we will always assess it against the potential impact on your rights.  While the concept of legitimate interest only exists in certain countries and regions, we balance our usage of your personal data against your rights globally.

International Data Transfer
The personal data we process may be accessed from, processed or transferred to countries other than the country in which you reside. Those countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. Such cross-border transfer of your personal data is necessary for us to service your transaction with us, and for the other purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement.
The servers for our platform are located in the United States, and the Expedia Group companies and third-party service providers operate in many countries around the world. When we collect your personal data, we may process it in any of those countries. Our employees may access your personal data from various countries around the world. The transferees of your personal data may also be located in countries other than the country in which you reside.
We have taken appropriate steps and put safeguards in place to help ensure that any access, processing and/or transfer of your personal data remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and in compliance with applicable data protection law. Such measures provide your personal data with a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that under the equivalent local law in your country, no matter where your data is accessed from, processed and/or transferred to. We will comply with obligations regarding personal data cross-border transfer in accordance with application data protection laws, regulations, and conditions set by the competent authorities. This may include fulfilling obligations such as security assessments and/or certifications and signing agreements with overseas recipients in accordance with the standard contract established by the competent authorities.
Some measures that we have in place include the following:
Adequacy decisions of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in certain non-EEA countries. Please see the latest list of such countries published by the European Commission
here
.
Transferee countries’ participation in the Global-CBPR forum. Please see the latest list of participant countries
here
. Expedia Group holds the Global-CBPR certification, and we have accordingly established measures across all Expedia Group companies to ensure that, where relevant to the transfer, personal data is shared in accordance with the CBPR requirements. Further detail on Expedia Group’s participation in such forum may be found in the
Global Cross Border Privacy Rules System Participation
section below.

Expedia, Inc. may be liable for onward transfers of Personal Information to third parties in violation of this Policy and the DPF Frameworks (will change defined term if needed based on feedback above).

Security
We want you to feel confident about using our platform and all associated tools and services, and we are committed to taking appropriate steps to protect the information we collect. While no company can guarantee absolute security, we do take reasonable steps to implement appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect the personal data that we collect and process.
Our cybersecurity team develops and deploys technical security controls and measures to ensure responsible personal data collection, storage, and sharing that is proportionate to the personal data’s level of confidentiality or sensitivity. We take efforts to continuously implement and update security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. We hold our data-handling partners to equally high standards.
We have established an information security protection system based on industry standard practices and perform regular assessment and certifications, such as PCI-DSS certification. We have also implemented appropriate security measures throughout the entire lifecycle of data collection, storage, processing, use, transmission, and sharing, and have taken certain technical and management measures including but not limited to verification and access controls, VPN, SSL encrypted transmission, and multi-factor authentication mechanisms, based on our information classification and processing standards, to ensure the security of systems and services.
We have management and approval mechanisms for employees who may have access to your information and provide regular information security training for employees.
In the event of a personal data security incident that may affect your rights and interests, you will be notified in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. We will also report the relevant incident to the competent regulatory authorities, if required by applicable laws and regulations.
Minors
Our website and mobile application are not directed at minors (as defined in applicable data protection laws) and we cannot distinguish the age of persons who access and use these.  If a minor has provided us with personal data without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us (see the
Contact Us

The limited circumstances we might need to collect the personal data of minors include as part of a reservation, the purchase of other travel-related services, or in other exceptional circumstances (such as features addressed to families). When processing personal data of minors, we strictly adhere to the principles of legality, necessity, clear purpose, openness, transparency, and security, and we take strict measures to protect such data.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our protection of minors’ personal data, or if you (in your capacity as the parent or guardian of the minor) wish to delete or correct the personal data of minors, please contact us via the
Contact Us
section below.
Record Retention
We will retain your personal data in accordance with all applicable laws, for as long as it may be relevant to fulfill the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will deidentify, aggregate, or otherwise anonymize your personal data if we intend to use it for analytical purposes or trend analysis over longer periods of time.
When we delete your personal data, we use industry standard methods to ensure that any recovery or retrieval of your information is impossible. We may keep residual copies of your personal data in backup systems to protect our systems from malicious loss. This personal data is inaccessible unless restored, and all unnecessary personal data will be deleted upon restoration.
The criteria we use to determine our retention periods include:
The duration of our relationship with you, including any open accounts you may have with Expedia Group companies, or recent bookings or other transactions you have made on our platform
Whether we have a legal obligation related to your personal data, such as laws requiring us to keep records of your transactions with us
Whether there are any current and relevant legal obligations affecting how long we will keep your personal data, including contractual obligations, litigation holds, statutes of limitations, and regulatory investigations

Collection and Use of Your Personal Data
In this section, you will find information about:
the types of personal data that we collect and use,
how we collect and use it,
the purposes for which we collect and use it, and
the lawful basis we rely on to collect and use it.
Lawful bases for processing:
In the table below, you will find the lawful bases we rely on to collect and use your personal data.
In summary, whenever we collect or use your personal data, that collection or use must be based on one of the following criteria:
Consent
: this means you have given your consent for us to do so (e.g., sending you marketing communications where consent is required).
Legal obligation:
this means we have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or use it for a specific purpose (e.g. using your transaction history to complete our financial and tax obligations under the law).
Performance of a contract:
this means the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g., manage your booking, process payments, or create an account at your request),
If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data).
Legitimate interest:
this means the processing is in our legitimate interests and those interests are not overridden by your rights (as explained below)
Certain countries and regions allow us to process personal data on the basis of legitimate interests. If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or the legitimate interests of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate or improve our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us, to respond to your queries, to undertake marketing, or for the purpose of  detecting or preventing illegal activities.  Whatever our determination of our specific legitimate interest is for a given use of your personal data, when we assess its appropriateness, we will always assess it against the potential impact on your rights.  While the concept of legitimate interest only exists in certain countries and regions, we balance our usage of your personal data against your rights globally.

International Data Transfer
The personal data we process may be accessed from, processed or transferred to countries other than the country in which you reside. Those countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. Such cross-border transfer of your personal data is necessary for us to service your transaction with us, and for the other purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement.
The servers for our platform are located in the United States, and the Expedia Group companies and third-party service providers operate in many countries around the world. When we collect your personal data, we may process it in any of those countries. Our employees may access your personal data from various countries around the world. The transferees of your personal data may also be located in countries other than the country in which you reside.
We have taken appropriate steps and put safeguards in place to help ensure that any access, processing and/or transfer of your personal data remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and in compliance with applicable data protection law. Such measures provide your personal data with a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that under the equivalent local law in your country, no matter where your data is accessed from, processed and/or transferred to. We will comply with obligations regarding personal data cross-border transfer in accordance with application data protection laws, regulations, and conditions set by the competent authorities. This may include fulfilling obligations such as security assessments and/or certifications and signing agreements with overseas recipients in accordance with the standard contract established by the competent authorities.
Some measures that we have in place include the following:
Adequacy decisions of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in certain non-EEA countries. Please see the latest list of such countries published by the European Commission
here
.
Transferee countries’ participation in the Global-CBPR forum. Please see the latest list of participant countries
here
. Expedia Group holds the Global-CBPR certification, and we have accordingly established measures across all Expedia Group companies to ensure that, where relevant to the transfer, personal data is shared in accordance with the CBPR requirements. Further detail on Expedia Group’s participation in such forum may be found in the
Global Cross Border Privacy Rules System Participation
section below.
Ensuring that the third-party partners, vendors and service providers to whom data transfers are made have appropriate mechanisms in place to protect your personal data. For instance, our agreements signed with our third-party partners, vendors and service providers incorporate strict data transfer terms (including, where applicable, the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission and/or United Kingdom, for transfers from the EEA/UK), and require all contracting parties to protect the personal data they process in accordance with applicable data protection law. Our agreements with our third-party partners, vendors and service providers may also include, where applicable, their certification under the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK extension to EU-U.S. DPF and/or Swiss-U.S. DPF certification (and any other country specific extension to the DPF Frameworks adopted from time to time), or reliance on the service provider's Binding Corporate Rules, as defined by the European Commission.  In regard to the onward principle of the DPF Frameworks, if Expedia, Inc. learns that a third party is using or disclosing your Personal Information in a manner that is contrary to this Policy, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure. Expedia, Inc. may be liable for onward transfers of Personal Information to third parties in violation of this Policy and the DPF Frameworks (will change defined term if needed based on feedback above).
Intragroup agreements in place for our Group companies which incorporate strict data transfer terms (including, where applicable, reliance on our Global-CBPR and DPF certifications (as appropriate to the transfer), with Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission and/or United Kingdom, for transfers from the EEA/UK incorporated as fallbacks in circumstances where we cannot rely on our DPF certifications) and require all group companies to protect the personal data they process in accordance with applicable data protection law.
Carrying out periodic risk assessments and implementing various technological and organization measures to ensure compliance with relevant laws on data transfer.
EU – U.S. Data Privacy Framework
All wholly-owned U.S. affiliates of Expedia, Inc. (part of the
Expedia Group of brands

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over such Expedia Group U.S. affiliates’ compliance with the DPF Frameworks.   In addition, Expedia Group maintains intra-group Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable to cover the transfer of EU personal data to the U.S in the event that any of our certifications to the DPF Frameworks cease to be a valid safeguard for a relevant transfer. Our certifications can be found
here

Security
We want you to feel confident about using our platform and all associated tools and services, and we are committed to taking appropriate steps to protect the information we collect. While no company can guarantee absolute security, we do take reasonable steps to implement appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect the personal data that we collect and process.
Our cybersecurity team develops and deploys technical security controls and measures to ensure responsible personal data collection, storage, and sharing that is proportionate to the personal data’s level of confidentiality or sensitivity. We take efforts to continuously implement and update security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. We hold our data-handling partners to equally high standards.
We have established an information security protection system based on industry standard practices and perform regular assessment and certifications, such as PCI-DSS certification. We have also implemented appropriate security measures throughout the entire lifecycle of data collection, storage, processing, use, transmission, and sharing, and have taken certain technical and management measures including but not limited to verification and access controls, VPN, SSL encrypted transmission, and multi-factor authentication mechanisms, based on our information classification and processing standards, to ensure the security of systems and services.
We have management and approval mechanisms for employees who may have access to your information and provide regular information security training for employees.
In the event of a personal data security incident that may affect your rights and interests, you will be notified in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. We will also report the relevant incident to the competent regulatory authorities, if required by applicable laws and regulations.
Minors
Our website and mobile application are not directed at minors (as defined in applicable data protection laws) and we cannot distinguish the age of persons who access and use these.  If a minor has provided us with personal data without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us (see the
Contact Us
section below). If we become aware that personal data has been collected from a minor without parental or guardian consent, we will terminate the minor’s account, where that minor has an account with us.
The limited circumstances we might need to collect the personal data of minors include as part of a reservation, the purchase of other travel-related services, or in other exceptional circumstances (such as features addressed to families). When processing personal data of minors, we strictly adhere to the principles of legality, necessity, clear purpose, openness, transparency, and security, and we take strict measures to protect such data.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our protection of minors’ personal data, or if you (in your capacity as the parent or guardian of the minor) wish to delete or correct the personal data of minors, please contact us via the
Contact Us
section below.
Record Retention
We will retain your personal data in accordance with all applicable laws, for as long as it may be relevant to fulfill the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will deidentify, aggregate, or otherwise anonymize your personal data if we intend to use it for analytical purposes or trend analysis over longer periods of time.
When we delete your personal data, we use industry standard methods to ensure that any recovery or retrieval of your information is impossible. We may keep residual copies of your personal data in backup systems to protect our systems from malicious loss. This personal data is inaccessible unless restored, and all unnecessary personal data will be deleted upon restoration.
The criteria we use to determine our retention periods include:
The duration of our relationship with you, including any open accounts you may have with Expedia Group companies, or recent bookings or other transactions you have made on our platform
Whether we have a legal obligation related to your personal data, such as laws requiring us to keep records of your transactions with us
Whether there are any current and relevant legal obligations affecting how long we will keep your personal data, including contractual obligations, litigation holds, statutes of limitations, and regulatory investigations

Collection and Use of Your Personal Data
In this section, you will find information about:
the types of personal data that we collect and use,
how we collect and use it,
the purposes for which we collect and use it, and
the lawful basis we rely on to collect and use it.
Lawful bases for processing:
In the table below, you will find the lawful bases we rely on to collect and use your personal data.
In summary, whenever we collect or use your personal data, that collection or use must be based on one of the following criteria:
Consent
: this means you have given your consent for us to do so (e.g., sending you marketing communications where consent is required).
Legal obligation:
this means we have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or use it for a specific purpose (e.g. using your transaction history to complete our financial and tax obligations under the law).
Performance of a contract:
this means the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g., manage your booking, process payments, or create an account at your request),
If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data).
Legitimate interest:
this means the processing is in our legitimate interests and those interests are not overridden by your rights (as explained below)
Certain countries and regions allow us to process personal data on the basis of legitimate interests. If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or the legitimate interests of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate or improve our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us, to respond to your queries, to undertake marketing, or for the purpose of  detecting or preventing illegal activities.  Whatever our determination of our specific legitimate interest is for a given use of your personal data, when we assess its appropriateness, we will always assess it against the potential impact on your rights.  While the concept of legitimate interest only exists in certain countries and regions, we balance our usage of your personal data against your rights globally.

International Data Transfer
The personal data we process may be accessed from, processed or transferred to countries other than the country in which you reside. Those countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. Such cross-border transfer of your personal data is necessary for us to service your transaction with us, and for the other purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement.
The servers for our platform are located in the United States, and the Expedia Group companies and third-party service providers operate in many countries around the world. When we collect your personal data, we may process it in any of those countries. Our employees may access your personal data from various countries around the world. The transferees of your personal data may also be located in countries other than the country in which you reside.
We have taken appropriate steps and put safeguards in place to help ensure that any access, processing and/or transfer of your personal data remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and in compliance with applicable data protection law. Such measures provide your personal data with a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that under the equivalent local law in your country, no matter where your data is accessed from, processed and/or transferred to. We will comply with obligations regarding personal data cross-border transfer in accordance with application data protection laws, regulations, and conditions set by the competent authorities. This may include fulfilling obligations such as security assessments and/or certifications and signing agreements with overseas recipients in accordance with the standard contract established by the competent authorities.
Some measures that we have in place include the following:
Adequacy decisions of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in certain non-EEA countries. Please see the latest list of such countries published by the European Commission

Global Cross Border Privacy Rules System Participation
section below.
Ensuring that the third-party partners, vendors and service providers to whom data transfers are made have appropriate mechanisms in place to protect your personal data. For instance, our agreements signed with our third-party partners, vendors and service providers incorporate strict data transfer terms (including, where applicable, the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission and/or United Kingdom, for transfers from the EEA/UK), and require all contracting parties to protect the personal data they process in accordance with applicable data protection law. Our agreements with our third-party partners, vendors and service providers may also include, where applicable, their certification under the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK extension to EU-U.S. DPF and/or Swiss-U.S. DPF certification (and any other country specific extension to the DPF Frameworks adopted from time to time), or reliance on the service provider's Binding Corporate Rules, as defined by the European Commission.  In regard to the onward principle of the DPF Frameworks, if Expedia, Inc. learns that a third party is using or disclosing your Personal Information in a manner that is contrary to this Policy, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure. Expedia, Inc. may be liable for onward transfers of Personal Information to third parties in violation of this Policy and the DPF Frameworks (will change defined term if needed based on feedback above).
Intragroup agreements in place for our Group companies which incorporate strict data transfer terms (including, where applicable, reliance on our Global-CBPR and DPF certifications (as appropriate to the transfer), with Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission and/or United Kingdom, for transfers from the EEA/UK incorporated as fallbacks in circumstances where we cannot rely on our DPF certifications) and require all group companies to protect the personal data they process in accordance with applicable data protection law.

We may keep residual copies of your personal data in backup systems to protect our systems from malicious loss. This personal data is inaccessible unless restored, and all unnecessary personal data will be deleted upon restoration.

Collection and Use of Your Personal Data
In this section, you will find information about:
the types of personal data that we collect and use,
how we collect and use it,
the purposes for which we collect and use it, and
the lawful basis we rely on to collect and use it.
Lawful bases for processing:
In the table below, you will find the lawful bases we rely on to collect and use your personal data.
In summary, whenever we collect or use your personal data, that collection or use must be based on one of the following criteria:
Consent
: this means you have given your consent for us to do so (e.g., sending you marketing communications where consent is required).
Legal obligation:
this means we have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or use it for a specific purpose (e.g. using your transaction history to complete our financial and tax obligations under the law).
Performance of a contract:
this means the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g., manage your booking, process payments, or create an account at your request),
If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data).
Legitimate interest:
this means the processing is in our legitimate interests and those interests are not overridden by your rights (as explained below)
Certain countries and regions allow us to process personal data on the basis of legitimate interests. If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or the legitimate interests of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate or improve our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us, to respond to your queries, to undertake marketing, or for the purpose of  detecting or preventing illegal activities.  Whatever our determination of our specific legitimate interest is for a given use of your personal data, when we assess its appropriateness, we will always assess it against the potential impact on your rights.  While the concept of legitimate interest only exists in certain countries and regions, we balance our usage of your personal data against your rights globally.

Our agreements with our third-party partners, vendors and service providers may also include, where applicable, their certification under the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK extension to EU-U.S. DPF and/or Swiss-U.S. DPF certification (and any other country specific extension to the DPF Frameworks adopted from time to time), or reliance on the service provider's Binding Corporate Rules, as defined by the European Commission.  In regard to the onward principle of the DPF Frameworks, if Expedia, Inc. learns that a third party is using or disclosing your Personal Information in a manner that is contrary to this Policy, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure. Expedia, Inc. may be liable for onward transfers of Personal Information to third parties in violation of this Policy and the DPF Frameworks (will change defined term if needed based on feedback above).
Intragroup agreements in place for our Group companies which incorporate strict data transfer terms (including, where applicable, reliance on our Global-CBPR and DPF certifications (as appropriate to the transfer), with Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission and/or United Kingdom, for transfers from the EEA/UK incorporated as fallbacks in circumstances where we cannot rely on our DPF certifications) and require all group companies to protect the personal data they process in accordance with applicable data protection law.

The limited circumstances we might need to collect the personal data of minors include as part of a reservation, the purchase of other travel-related services, or in other exceptional circumstances (such as features addressed to families). When processing personal data of minors, we strictly adhere to the principles of legality, necessity, clear purpose, openness, transparency, and security, and we take strict measures to protect such data.

When we delete your personal data, we use industry standard methods to ensure that any recovery or retrieval of your information is impossible. We may keep residual copies of your personal data in backup systems to protect our systems from malicious loss. This personal data is inaccessible unless restored, and all unnecessary personal data will be deleted upon restoration.
