If we do not receive any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material.

STYLE GUIDES
Influenster is a forum for your thoughtful reviews, photos, videos, tips and more. Thus, we've put together these general guidelines for keeping it clean and classy here on our site:
INFLUENSTER REVIEW SECTION
Go Bare:
That’s right, bare it all. The best reviews are personal and passionate as well as open and honest. Writing a review of something you received from us? Make sure to disclose that you received the products free from Influenster for testing purposes at the beginning of your description .
Use Good Taste:
We Influensters pride ourselves on our style, so don’t trash your reputation by using offensive language and imagery. Furthermore, threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry will not be tolerated.
Stay in Good Form:
Let’s save the non sequiturs for the blogosphere. We expect your contributions to be relevant to the product you’re reviewing. Reviews aren't the place for rants about political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the core of the consumer experience.
Cut Out the Bias:
Your contributions should be objective. Don’t review your own business or employer, your friends' or relatives' businesses, or businesses in your networking group.
Say It, Don’t Sell It:
The power of Influenster is the power of YOU. Here, consumers have the final word, so let’s not muck up our review section with more commercial noise.
Keep Secrets:
Remember the Golden Rule? Please respect the privacy of others. This means refraining from publishing personal information, close-up photos, and full names of any of your friends, enemies, and countrymen.
Innovation, Not Imitation:
What you learned in middle school still applies - absolutely NO plagiarism. We want to hear from you, so show us your (own) stuff!
Avoid the Overstatement:
It’s easy to get carried away. Please avoid exaggerating or misrepresenting your experience.
Be Picky - Click Hearts with Discretion:
These hearts don’t mean whether you “Agree.” Like reviews only when they’re useful, helpful, and truthful. Reviews are sorted by what's most helpful, so make sure new visitors see the ones that shine.
Be Constructive:
We all know how disappointing it can be when you buy something only to find it doesn’t work the way you thought it would. While it may be tempting to vent your frustrations here, remember that reviews should relay “what” and “why.” And please, for everyone’s sake, lay off the caps lock.
Be Creative:
These reviews weren’t written by robots. Let the “you” shine through!
THE Q&A SECTION
Be Curious:
Influensters have the answers. If you want to know more about a product, use the Q&A; section. But first, check that your question hasn’t already been asked. It probably has!
Share the Wealth:
Think you’ve got the answer? Help out your fellow Influensters with all the info you’ve got. Your answers should be helpful, honest, and relevant. Spread the knowledge!
*Please be advised that Influenster retains the right to remove any inappropriate content or to revoke membership for Style Guide violations.
ON YOUR BLOG, VLOG, AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS
Heed the VoxFox:
In all online features and comments, please make sure to disclose that you received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster at the beginning of your description. This keeps everyone honest - you, us, and our partners - so we can all be trusted Influensters.
Title, Title, Title:
Don’t keep it a secret. Include the name of the product you’re reviewing in your blog or video title.
Keep it Clean:
The Influenster Facebook page is a hub for our community. Use clean language, courteous behavior, and appropriate images. Failure to do so will result in a ban from the page.
THE HUB
Stay Considerate & Constructive:
Show your fellow Influenster bloggers some love by commenting on their posts, but remember the Golden Rule - respect them as they would do for you!
Submit Quality:
Influensters value fun, quality posts and we hold the rights to decide what in Influenster Nation is appropriate or not, when specially inviting you to contribute to The Hub.

STYLE GUIDES
Influenster is a forum for your thoughtful reviews, photos, videos, tips and more. Thus, we've put together these general guidelines for keeping it clean and classy here on our site:
INFLUENSTER REVIEW SECTION
Go Bare:
That’s right, bare it all. The best reviews are personal and passionate as well as open and honest. Writing a review of something you received from us? Make sure to disclose that you received the products free from Influenster for testing purposes at the beginning of your description .
Use Good Taste:
We Influensters pride ourselves on our style, so don’t trash your reputation by using offensive language and imagery. Furthermore, threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry will not be tolerated.
Stay in Good Form:
Let’s save the non sequiturs for the blogosphere. We expect your contributions to be relevant to the product you’re reviewing. Reviews aren't the place for rants about political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the core of the consumer experience.
Cut Out the Bias:
Your contributions should be objective. Don’t review your own business or employer, your friends' or relatives' businesses, or businesses in your networking group.
Say It, Don’t Sell It:
The power of Influenster is the power of YOU. Here, consumers have the final word, so let’s not muck up our review section with more commercial noise.
Keep Secrets:
Remember the Golden Rule? Please respect the privacy of others. This means refraining from publishing personal information, close-up photos, and full names of any of your friends, enemies, and countrymen.
Innovation, Not Imitation:
What you learned in middle school still applies - absolutely NO plagiarism. We want to hear from you, so show us your (own) stuff!
Avoid the Overstatement:
It’s easy to get carried away. Please avoid exaggerating or misrepresenting your experience.
Be Picky - Click Hearts with Discretion:
These hearts don’t mean whether you “Agree.” Like reviews only when they’re useful, helpful, and truthful. Reviews are sorted by what's most helpful, so make sure new visitors see the ones that shine.
Be Constructive:
We all know how disappointing it can be when you buy something only to find it doesn’t work the way you thought it would. While it may be tempting to vent your frustrations here, remember that reviews should relay “what” and “why.” And please, for everyone’s sake, lay off the caps lock.
Be Creative:
These reviews weren’t written by robots. Let the “you” shine through!
THE Q&A SECTION
Be Curious:
Influensters have the answers. If you want to know more about a product, use the Q&A; section. But first, check that your question hasn’t already been asked. It probably has!
Share the Wealth:
Think you’ve got the answer? Help out your fellow Influensters with all the info you’ve got. Your answers should be helpful, honest, and relevant. Spread the knowledge!
*Please be advised that Influenster retains the right to remove any inappropriate content or to revoke membership for Style Guide violations.
ON YOUR BLOG, VLOG, AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS
Heed the VoxFox:
In all online features and comments, please make sure to disclose that you received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster at the beginning of your description. This keeps everyone honest - you, us, and our partners - so we can all be trusted Influensters.
Title, Title, Title:
Don’t keep it a secret. Include the name of the product you’re reviewing in your blog or video title.
Keep it Clean:
The Influenster Facebook page is a hub for our community. Use clean language, courteous behavior, and appropriate images. Failure to do so will result in a ban from the page.
THE HUB
Stay Considerate & Constructive:
Show your fellow Influenster bloggers some love by commenting on their posts, but remember the Golden Rule - respect them as they would do for you!
Submit Quality:
Influensters value fun, quality posts and we hold the rights to decide what in Influenster Nation is appropriate or not, when specially inviting you to contribute to The Hub.

PRIVACY POLICY
EFFECTIVE AS OF MARCH 8, 2021
Your privacy, and the privacy of all users of Influenster is important to us. Influenster is committed to protecting your privacy online. Accordingly, Influenster has developed this privacy policy that describes how we collect, use, and share your data ("Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy sets forth the policies and procedures of personal information received from users of the Service, including but not limited to the website at
www.influenster.com
,
www.bazaarvoice.com
,
and/or the mobile applications created by Influenster (collectively, the "Influenster Service" or "Service").
This Privacy Policy is applicable to all site visitors, registered users, and all other users of the Service.
The terms "We", "Us", and "Influenster " refer to the Influenster Service. The terms "You" and "Your" refer to you, as a visitor or user of the Service.
By using the Service, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time.
Further, you acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Service ("TOS"), which is incorporated by reference, and by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, and the terms and conditions in our TOS, you may not access or use the Service.
HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR INFORMATION
Personal Information: When registering as a user to the Service, we receive and store information you enter or provide to us in any other way. The types of personal information collected may include your name, email address, URL, phone number, Twitter, Tumblr, Google Plus and/or Facebook usernames, location, use information regarding your use of the Service, browser information, and any other data that is tied to such information (collectively, "Personal Information"). The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service, improving the content of the Service, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.
Profiles: "Public Content" refers to information that you submit or post to the Service for public display, such as photos, comments, reviews, and your public profile information.
Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Service, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. This data is treated as non-Personal Information, except as required under applicable law.
HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED
Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We provide some of our services through affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties. We may share Public Content, as well as a limited amount of Personal Information (including, but not limited to, your first name, last initial, and location) with third parties, who may in turn publicly display or publish this limited amount of Personal Information in connection with Public Content on their own website and media platforms. Personal information collected as part of the SMS program is not shared. At any time you may visit the "Account Settings" page of your Member Account and opt-out of having some or all of your Personal Information made available to such third parties as described herein.
We encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personal Information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.
We may disclose aggregated information concerning user behavior to third parties in connection with actual or prospective business relationship with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.
In the future, may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Service. These companies may use information about your Public Content (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) and activity related to your use of the Service to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
One of the primary reasons people use Influenster is to connect with others. Information such as your name and photo, photos of your items, location, list of friends, and the comments you write is shared with the Influenster community. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in comments or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Service.
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, such as the creation of shipping labels, and need to share your information with them to provide services to you. Our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information.
Law Enforcement and Protection. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our TOS and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public. Please note that we are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that we receive.
Invite Friends and Contacts. You may choose to provide us with another person's e-mail address or social network profile information so that person may be invited to create an account on this site and become your friend. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person about the invitation. By providing us with another person's e-mail address, you represent to us that you have obtained the consent of the person concerned with respect to such disclosure to us of their Personal Information. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above.
Business Transfers. If Influenster or substantially all of Influenster's assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that we cease business operations or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

Other sites accessible through our site via links or service partnerships have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, other companies may place advertising on our site and may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.
CONTROL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
