Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing operations involving personal data, Art. 6 (1) (a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data. When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures. Insofar as processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) lit. c DSGVO serves as the legal basis. In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make processing of personal data necessary, Art. 6 (1) lit. d DSGVO serves as the legal basis. If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 (1) f DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the processing.

The website makes use of the following technologies outlined hereafter.
Strictly Necessary Cookies. We use cookies which are strictly necessary to enable users to be able to enter the website and use certain features of it, such as being able to log in and gain access to safe areas. These cookies are crucial for the use and navigation of the website. Without those cookies, fundamental features of our website would not function. As these cookies are necessary for the operation of the website, users are not able to opt out of them.
Optional cookies. We use "analytics" cookies that enable us to track and count the amount of users who have visited the website, and to understand how visitors navigate around the site when they use it. This helps us enhance the functionality of our website, for instance, by assuring that visitors can easily find exactly what they need. Those cookies only give us anonymous traffic metrics (like the number of page visits), the amount of visitors, and the amount of the time spent on every page. These cookies also enable us to monitor how frequently people click on posts on third-party websites, for example, on social media. In the framework of using Google Analytics, optional cookies from Google are placed on our website. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics utilizes cookies to understand how users are interacting with the Services. The cookie generated information regarding your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transferred to Google and saved by Google on their servers. This information will be used by Google to analyze your use of the services, to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other services related to the use of the website and the Internet. Google might also transmit this information to third parties if it is legally mandated to do so or if third parties are processing this information on behalf of Google. If you want to know more about how Google Analytics gathers and makes use of personal data, please read the privacy policy, which can be accessed here: Google Privacy Policy. To deactivate detection by Google Analytics on all websites, visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. By making use of the services, you agree to the data gathered about you being handled by Google in the previously mentioned manner and for the above-mentioned purpose.

We and our third-party partners, including Facebook, may employ cookies, pixels, or other tracking technologies to aggregate information regarding your browsing activity over time and across various websites after you have used the site, and to use this information to send targeted ads. We do not respond to "do not track" or other such mechanisms of web browsers currently. If we respond to "do not track" signals in the future, we will then update this Privacy Policy to outline how we do so.
All of these purposes also represent our legitimate interests, which we pursue with the processing of personal data associated with each of them. The legal basis is accordingly Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).
Service Providers:
We employ certain trusted third parties to conduct features and deliver services on our behalf, including, but not limited to, web hosting and maintenance. We will disclose your personal information to those third parties but limited to the amount required to conduct such functions and deliver such services, and only under binding contractual commitments that commit those third parties to maintaining the privacy and security of your information. In addition, we might use the information provided by you through third-party services to deliver the services, which might include accessing the third-party services you selected so that we can provide you with the information you requested. Regarding mobile applications or mobile versions of our websites, we might gather the unique device identifier that has been assigned to the device by phone manufacturers, network providers, or manufacturers of the operating system (the "Device ID"). Device IDs allow app developers, marketers, and others to clearly identify your device to store application preferences and other information. We make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that our service providers comply with the security standards we apply to your personal information. We might use your device ID to provide security. For instance, if you have activated a function that limits access to a service from a certain device, our systems will be accessing the device ID from any device you try to use to gain access to the services to verify that the device is the authorized device. We might also use device IDs to track suspicious activities. For example, if we discover that a single account on a website is being visited from multiple devices, as identified by tracking the device IDs that are accessing an account, we might reach out to the user to verify that such access has been approved by the user.
