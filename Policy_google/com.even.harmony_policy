PERSONAL INFORMATION WE RECEIVE
“
Personal Information
” means any data that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, is linked to or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a person or household or any other data or information that constitutes “personal data,” “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information” under applicable privacy laws. When you use our Services we receive Personal Information in a variety of ways, including directly from you and/or your devices, from third parties (including our affiliates, banking partners, your employer, and other users), from publicly available sources, and through information that we collect automatically. We may receive the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers
: We receive identifiers, such as name, email, login credentials, address, phone number, password, date of birth, Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, military status, driver’s license or other government issued identification and numbers, and country of citizenship.
Demographic Information
: We may receive demographic information, such as marital status, language preferences, citizenship status, race and gender, when such information is included in documents, such as government issued identification and tax forms and returns, that you share with us.
Biometric Information
: As part of verifying your account, we may ask you to upload to one of our service providers, Persona Identities, Inc. (“
Persona
”) a live selfie and a photo of your driver’s license or other government issued identification. Persona processes these images, including by generating data about your facial geometry (which may be considered biometric information in some jurisdictions) for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud. This may involve comparing the biometric information generated from your selfie to the biometric information generated from your ID, as well as comparing the biometric information generated from your images to the biometric information generated from other images. Persona stores the biometric information and uses it to perform ongoing identity-verification and fraud-prevention screenings and permanently deletes the data when it is no longer needed to fulfill those purposes, or within three years of the initial creation of the data, whichever is sooner. Persona relies on service providers to process the biometric information and other information for these purposes. For more information on Persona’s policies, please visit Persona’s Privacy Policy (
https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy

CCPA
”), as set forth below:
Transparency
: The CCPA requires that we notify consumers at or before the collection of their Personal Information of the categories of Personal Information we have collected about consumers in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources from which such Personal Information is collected, our purposes for collecting such Personal Information, whether such Personal Information is “sold” or “shared”, and the length of time we intend to retain each such category of Personal Information, or if that is not possible, the criteria we use to determine our retention periods, among other information.

Correction

If you find that there is an error or you want to dispute the information found in your credit report, please contact the credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax.
Deletion
: Right to delete Personal Information about you, subject to certain exceptions.
Opt Out of Processing (“Sales”, “Sharing” and Targeted Advertising)
: We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). However, as is common practice among companies that operate online, we may use advertising and analytics services that are intended to analyze your interactions with our Services, based on information obtained from cookies or other trackers, including for delivering advertising to you (such as interest-based, targeted, or cross-context behavioral advertising). With respect to your interactions on
www.ONE.app
and the One Apps
we may disclose certain of this information, including device and usage information, to third parties, and such disclosure may be considered a “sale” and/or “sharing” of Personal Information under various state laws. You can opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information in a frictionless manner by implementing the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) in your browser. For instructions on how to download and use GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org
.  You can also opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information by clicking “Your Privacy Choices”on
www.One.app
. Your opt-out decision is specific to a particular device and browser. If you use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out on each. Additionally, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again. Please note that even if you opt out of the “sale” and “sharing” of your Personal Information, we may still use essential cookies to track your use of our Services, including for purposes of operating the Services and for legal and security reasons, such as detecting and preventing fraud. We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.
Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information:
We may receive certain information that is considered sensitive under the CCPA, such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers, race and citizenship status, biometric information and precise geolocation, as described in more detail in Section 2 above. We only process such sensitive Personal Information in order to provide the Services, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, such that we are not required to provide the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive Personal Information.
Non-Discrimination
: The right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and Services or engage with you in the same manner.
Shine the Light
: California residents who have an established business relationship with us have the right to know how their information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law, (Civ. Code §1798.83).
We do not share Personal Information with third parties for such purposes.
To exercise your rights, please submit a request by contacting us at support@one.app, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: ONE Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. We will acknowledge your request within 10 business days of receipt, and within 45 calendar days of receipt we will either provide a substantive response or notify you of an extension period of up to an additional 45 calendar days and a reason therefor. You can also correct and delete certain information directly in the ONE Apps.
Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm your residency. To do so, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account, or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional Personal Information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address and phone number.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems or where no U.S. state laws apply to our processing of your Personal Information because it is collected and processed subject to GLBA. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request in our substantive response.
You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney. The authorized agent must provide a letter signed by you confirming the agent has permission to submit a request on your behalf or must provide sufficient evidence to show that the authorized agent has been lawfully vested with power of attorney. For security purposes, where authorized agent does not have power of attorney, we may need to verify your identity and confirm directly with you that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we will direct future communications to the consumer on whose behalf the request was made.
If we deny your request, some states afford you the right to appeal our decision. You may do so by contacting us at
support@one.app,
1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: ONE Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. Within 45 days of receipt, we will notify you in writing of our decision and the reasons therefor.
6.   RETENTION
We may retain Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. In determining our retention periods, we use the following criteria: our relationship with you, the choices you have made with respect to your Personal Information, the permissibility of retention (including for backup and archival purposes), our legal and regulatory rights and obligations (including with respect to the prevention of fraud and abuse).
We do not delete your Personal Information upon deactivation of your account. Although your deactivated status is reflected promptly in our user databases, we may retain your Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including legal compliance, backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. Upon deactivation of your account, you will no longer receive emails from us and links to third-party financial accounts and services will automatically terminate. If you have a money transfer transaction pending at the time you deactivate your account, your link to this service from us will terminate but your pending transfer will continue to completion and your bank account will remain open.
7.   CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If you believe that a child under the age of 16 may have provided us with Personal Information without parental consent, please contact us.
8.   THIRD-PARTY PRIVACY PRACTICES
This Privacy Policy covers our privacy practices only. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties, including third parties with whom we partner. Third-party websites, services and applications are governed by each such third party's privacy policy, which we encourage you to read carefully. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and we are not responsible for the failure of third parties to honor their privacy obligations.

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE RECEIVE
“
Personal Information
” means any data that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, is linked to or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a person or household or any other data or information that constitutes “personal data,” “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information” under applicable privacy laws. When you use our Services we receive Personal Information in a variety of ways, including directly from you and/or your devices, from third parties (including our affiliates, banking partners, your employer, and other users), from publicly available sources, and through information that we collect automatically. We may receive the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers
: We receive identifiers, such as name, email, login credentials, address, phone number, password, date of birth, Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, military status, driver’s license or other government issued identification and numbers, and country of citizenship.
Demographic Information

Biometric Information
: As part of verifying your account, we may ask you to upload to one of our service providers, Persona Identities, Inc. (“
Persona
”) a live selfie and a photo of your driver’s license or other government issued identification. Persona processes these images, including by generating data about your facial geometry (which may be considered biometric information in some jurisdictions) for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud. This may involve comparing the biometric information generated from your selfie to the biometric information generated from your ID, as well as comparing the biometric information generated from your images to the biometric information generated from other images. Persona stores the biometric information and uses it to perform ongoing identity-verification and fraud-prevention screenings and permanently deletes the data when it is no longer needed to fulfill those purposes, or within three years of the initial creation of the data, whichever is sooner. Persona relies on service providers to process the biometric information and other information for these purposes. For more information on Persona’s policies, please visit Persona’s Privacy Policy (
https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy

CCPA
”), as set forth below:
Transparency
: The CCPA requires that we notify consumers at or before the collection of their Personal Information of the categories of Personal Information we have collected about consumers in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources from which such Personal Information is collected, our purposes for collecting such Personal Information, whether such Personal Information is “sold” or “shared”, and the length of time we intend to retain each such category of Personal Information, or if that is not possible, the criteria we use to determine our retention periods, among other information.

Access
: Right to request access to the categories of your Personal Information that we have collected, disclosed, or “sold”, as well as the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we have collected, the categories of sources from which we have collected such Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed, “sold” or “shared” such Personal Information, and our purposes for collecting, “selling” or “sharing” such Personal Information.
Correction

If you find that there is an error or you want to dispute the information found in your credit report, please contact the credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax.
Deletion
: Right to delete Personal Information about you, subject to certain exceptions.
Opt Out of Processing (“Sales”, “Sharing” and Targeted Advertising)
: We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). However, as is common practice among companies that operate online, we may use advertising and analytics services that are intended to analyze your interactions with our Services, based on information obtained from cookies or other trackers, including for delivering advertising to you (such as interest-based, targeted, or cross-context behavioral advertising). With respect to your interactions on
www.ONE.app
and the One Apps
we may disclose certain of this information, including device and usage information, to third parties, and such disclosure may be considered a “sale” and/or “sharing” of Personal Information under various state laws. You can opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information in a frictionless manner by implementing the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) in your browser. For instructions on how to download and use GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org
.  You can also opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information by clicking “Your Privacy Choices”on

. Your opt-out decision is specific to a particular device and browser. If you use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out on each. Additionally, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again. Please note that even if you opt out of the “sale” and “sharing” of your Personal Information, we may still use essential cookies to track your use of our Services, including for purposes of operating the Services and for legal and security reasons, such as detecting and preventing fraud. We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.
Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information:
We may receive certain information that is considered sensitive under the CCPA, such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers, race and citizenship status, biometric information and precise geolocation, as described in more detail in Section 2 above. We only process such sensitive Personal Information in order to provide the Services, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, such that we are not required to provide the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive Personal Information.
Non-Discrimination
: The right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and Services or engage with you in the same manner.
Shine the Light
: California residents who have an established business relationship with us have the right to know how their information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law, (Civ. Code §1798.83).
We do not share Personal Information with third parties for such purposes.
To exercise your rights, please submit a request by contacting us at support@one.app, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: ONE Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. We will acknowledge your request within 10 business days of receipt, and within 45 calendar days of receipt we will either provide a substantive response or notify you of an extension period of up to an additional 45 calendar days and a reason therefor. You can also correct and delete certain information directly in the ONE Apps.
Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm your residency. To do so, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account, or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional Personal Information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address and phone number.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems or where no U.S. state laws apply to our processing of your Personal Information because it is collected and processed subject to GLBA. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request in our substantive response.
You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney. The authorized agent must provide a letter signed by you confirming the agent has permission to submit a request on your behalf or must provide sufficient evidence to show that the authorized agent has been lawfully vested with power of attorney. For security purposes, where authorized agent does not have power of attorney, we may need to verify your identity and confirm directly with you that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we will direct future communications to the consumer on whose behalf the request was made.
If we deny your request, some states afford you the right to appeal our decision. You may do so by contacting us at
support@one.app,
1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: ONE Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. Within 45 days of receipt, we will notify you in writing of our decision and the reasons therefor.
6.   RETENTION
We may retain Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. In determining our retention periods, we use the following criteria: our relationship with you, the choices you have made with respect to your Personal Information, the permissibility of retention (including for backup and archival purposes), our legal and regulatory rights and obligations (including with respect to the prevention of fraud and abuse).
We do not delete your Personal Information upon deactivation of your account. Although your deactivated status is reflected promptly in our user databases, we may retain your Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including legal compliance, backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. Upon deactivation of your account, you will no longer receive emails from us and links to third-party financial accounts and services will automatically terminate. If you have a money transfer transaction pending at the time you deactivate your account, your link to this service from us will terminate but your pending transfer will continue to completion and your bank account will remain open.
7.   CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If you believe that a child under the age of 16 may have provided us with Personal Information without parental consent, please contact us.

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE RECEIVE
“
Personal Information
” means any data that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, is linked to or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a person or household or any other data or information that constitutes “personal data,” “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information” under applicable privacy laws. When you use our Services we receive Personal Information in a variety of ways, including directly from you and/or your devices, from third parties (including our affiliates, banking partners, your employer, and other users), from publicly available sources, and through information that we collect automatically. We may receive the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers
: We receive identifiers, such as name, email, login credentials, address, phone number, password, date of birth, Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, military status, driver’s license or other government issued identification and numbers, and country of citizenship.
Demographic Information
: We may receive demographic information, such as marital status, language preferences, citizenship status, race and gender, when such information is included in documents, such as government issued identification and tax forms and returns, that you share with us.
Biometric Information
: As part of verifying your account, we may ask you to upload to one of our service providers, Persona Identities, Inc. (“
Persona
”) a live selfie and a photo of your driver’s license or other government issued identification. Persona processes these images, including by generating data about your facial geometry (which may be considered biometric information in some jurisdictions) for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud. This may involve comparing the biometric information generated from your selfie to the biometric information generated from your ID, as well as comparing the biometric information generated from your images to the biometric information generated from other images. Persona stores the biometric information and uses it to perform ongoing identity-verification and fraud-prevention screenings and permanently deletes the data when it is no longer needed to fulfill those purposes, or within three years of the initial creation of the data, whichever is sooner. Persona relies on service providers to process the biometric information and other information for these purposes. For more information on Persona’s policies, please visit Persona’s Privacy Policy (
https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy

CCPA
”), as set forth below:
Transparency
: The CCPA requires that we notify consumers at or before the collection of their Personal Information of the categories of Personal Information we have collected about consumers in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources from which such Personal Information is collected, our purposes for collecting such Personal Information, whether such Personal Information is “sold” or “shared”, and the length of time we intend to retain each such category of Personal Information, or if that is not possible, the criteria we use to determine our retention periods, among other information. This Privacy Policy contains such information. Please read it, as well as any other terms that are provided to you at or before the collection of your Personal Information, carefully.
Access
: Right to request access to the categories of your Personal Information that we have collected, disclosed, or “sold”, as well as the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we have collected, the categories of sources from which we have collected such Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed, “sold” or “shared” such Personal Information, and our purposes for collecting, “selling” or “sharing” such Personal Information.
Correction
: Right to correct inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that information related to your creditworthiness is maintained by the credit bureaus. If you find that there is an error or you want to dispute the information found in your credit report, please contact the credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax.
Deletion
: Right to delete Personal Information about you, subject to certain exceptions.
Opt Out of Processing (“Sales”, “Sharing” and Targeted Advertising)
: We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). However, as is common practice among companies that operate online, we may use advertising and analytics services that are intended to analyze your interactions with our Services, based on information obtained from cookies or other trackers, including for delivering advertising to you (such as interest-based, targeted, or cross-context behavioral advertising). With respect to your interactions on
www.ONE.app
and the One Apps
we may disclose certain of this information, including device and usage information, to third parties, and such disclosure may be considered a “sale” and/or “sharing” of Personal Information under various state laws. You can opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information in a frictionless manner by implementing the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) in your browser. For instructions on how to download and use GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org
.  You can also opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information by clicking “Your Privacy Choices”on
www.One.app
. Your opt-out decision is specific to a particular device and browser. If you use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out on each. Additionally, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again. Please note that even if you opt out of the “sale” and “sharing” of your Personal Information, we may still use essential cookies to track your use of our Services, including for purposes of operating the Services and for legal and security reasons, such as detecting and preventing fraud. We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.
Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information:
We may receive certain information that is considered sensitive under the CCPA, such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers, race and citizenship status, biometric information and precise geolocation, as described in more detail in Section 2 above. We only process such sensitive Personal Information in order to provide the Services, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, such that we are not required to provide the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive Personal Information.
Non-Discrimination
: The right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and Services or engage with you in the same manner.
Shine the Light
: California residents who have an established business relationship with us have the right to know how their information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law, (Civ. Code §1798.83).
We do not share Personal Information with third parties for such purposes.
To exercise your rights, please submit a request by contacting us at support@one.app, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: ONE Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. We will acknowledge your request within 10 business days of receipt, and within 45 calendar days of receipt we will either provide a substantive response or notify you of an extension period of up to an additional 45 calendar days and a reason therefor. You can also correct and delete certain information directly in the ONE Apps.
Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm your residency. To do so, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account, or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional Personal Information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address and phone number.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems or where no U.S. state laws apply to our processing of your Personal Information because it is collected and processed subject to GLBA. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request in our substantive response.
You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney. The authorized agent must provide a letter signed by you confirming the agent has permission to submit a request on your behalf or must provide sufficient evidence to show that the authorized agent has been lawfully vested with power of attorney. For security purposes, where authorized agent does not have power of attorney, we may need to verify your identity and confirm directly with you that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we will direct future communications to the consumer on whose behalf the request was made.
If we deny your request, some states afford you the right to appeal our decision. You may do so by contacting us at
support@one.app,
1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: ONE Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. Within 45 days of receipt, we will notify you in writing of our decision and the reasons therefor.
6.   RETENTION

In determining our retention periods, we use the following criteria: our relationship with you, the choices you have made with respect to your Personal Information, the permissibility of retention (including for backup and archival purposes), our legal and regulatory rights and obligations (including with respect to the prevention of fraud and abuse).
We do not delete your Personal Information upon deactivation of your account. Although your deactivated status is reflected promptly in our user databases, we may retain your Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including legal compliance, backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. Upon deactivation of your account, you will no longer receive emails from us and links to third-party financial accounts and services will automatically terminate. If you have a money transfer transaction pending at the time you deactivate your account, your link to this service from us will terminate but your pending transfer will continue to completion and your bank account will remain open.
7.   CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If you believe that a child under the age of 16 may have provided us with Personal Information without parental consent, please contact us.

This Privacy Policy covers our privacy practices only. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties, including third parties with whom we partner.
