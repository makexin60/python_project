For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share and protect the information consistently with this Policy, including honoring your communications preferences, when marketing their products and services, your advertising consents, and any state-specific privacy rights you may have. When we combine DIRECTV information with information that comes from an affiliate that has a different privacy policy, the DIRECTV Privacy Policy applies to our use of the combined data.
Service providers
.
We share information that identifies you personally with non-DIRECTV companies that provide services to us, like security, fraud prevention, and analytics, or that support the Products and Services provided to you and that help us run the business, including advertising, marketing, ad delivery services, information technology, engineering, sales and service, and customer care. We do not allow those vendors to use information about you in an identifiable form for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us consistent with this Policy.
We also share information with advertising service providers that use data about you to show you tailored ads based on your interests and to otherwise market our Products and Services.
Advertisers
.
We show ads from other companies on our Products and Services, and we share information with third parties for tailored advertising and other advertising purposes. Those third parties may include advertisers and their agents, programmers and networks, social media networks, analytics firms (companies that measure and analyze consumer behavior), advertising service providers (companies that deliver and track ads for advertisers across websites, applications, and devices), and other similar companies that are involved in creating, delivering, and measuring the performance of advertisements.
The advertisements that you see may be tailored to your interests based on information we collect through the App, Device, Set-Top Box, or that we obtain from third parties relating to: (i) your use of our Products and Services (including your use of the App, your Device, and your Set-Top Box, which may include what apps are accessed and location information), (ii) your relationships with companies that advertise on our Products and Services, (iii) the advertisements or content you viewed, (iv) your online activities, and (v) household, location, and demographic information. To facilitate those ads, we don’t share information with advertisers that can directly identify you, such as your name or postal address. Instead, we and our advertisers share limited information with third-party service providers who employ a matching process that connects information about your interests (for example, coffee-lover or sports enthusiast) to identifiers (like operating system, including Apple or Android ID, or other similar identifiers) that do not identify you personally but instead are associated with your browser or devices and are used to serve you tailored ads. We may also compile and provide reports, including in encrypted, aggregated, or de-identified forms, to advertisers about the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
We may also sell or share the information we collect, including your viewing information, demographic information, and information about your general and specific interests, with business customers for their own advertising or marketing uses, or for use in their advertising products and services for advertisers and other clients. That use includes supporting tailored advertising on other, non-DIRECTV services, like other websites and streaming platforms. When we sell or share your information, we do not share personal information that directly identifies you and our agreements require the information we send to be anonymized, aggregated or made pseudonymous before it is shared or integrated into third-party products. We do not allow business customers to use directly identifying information in their services and we require compliance with applicable privacy laws.
Our sharing of your information for advertising may be considered a “sale” of personal information under certain state privacy laws. For more details on how we share your information for advertising, please see our
Advertising Notice
. To exercise choices about our use of information for advertising, please visit
Your Privacy Choices
.
Media research companies
.
We share viewing, demographic, and household information tied to identifiers that do not identify you personally, including information collected through our App, Devices, and Set-Top Boxes with media research companies who may combine the shared data with other data characteristics they have obtained including from other video programming distributors or their own sourced household panels, to provide measurement and audience analysis services, and to give them better insight into TV viewing trends, such as national or regional viewing statistics and TV ratings. When we do, we may share data with third-party matching providers that will safely replace information that directly identifies you with an identifier that does not directly identify you or will anonymize the data before delivery to the media research companies or advertising partners. We require media research companies to agree that they will not attempt to identify any person using this information, and that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy. Such sharing with media research companies may be considered a “sale” of data under certain state privacy laws. To exercise choices about our use of information, including to opt-out of “sales” under certain state privacy laws, please visit

Research
.
We may share information with other entities for research. We require these companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to use it to identify individuals. Our agreements also prevent those entities from reusing or reselling the information and require that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.
Location information.
We collect and share location information, for example to provide access to local programming, such as local news and sports, and advertising. Without your location information, we may not be able to provide access to certain services and features, including live local channels or other content with geographic restrictions. We may use your location to deliver certain features, such as the channel guide. This data may also be used to tailor advertising to you based on your location. You may have the right to control location tracking within our mobile Apps or other services through options provided on the specific app or service. If you disable location tracking on your device, you acknowledge and agree the App may determine your location, such as using your public IP address, to determine your general location for purposes of delivering services.
In connection with a transaction.
If we sell all or parts of our business, make the transfer of assets, or otherwise might be involved in a change of control transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer information to one or more third parties as a part of the transaction, including the due diligence process.
To regulators, law enforcement, for litigation purposes, and for legal compliance.

Our sharing of your information for advertising may be considered a “sale” of personal information under certain state privacy laws. For more details on how we share your information for advertising, please see our

When we do, we may share data with third-party matching providers that will safely replace information that directly identifies you with an identifier that does not directly identify you or will anonymize the data before delivery to the media research companies or advertising partners. We require media research companies to agree that they will not attempt to identify any person using this information, and that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy. Such sharing with media research companies may be considered a “sale” of data under certain state privacy laws.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies:
You may opt-out of the sale, sharing, or targeted advertising, as those terms are defined under applicable consumer privacy laws, in the context of cookies and other tracking technologies on our websites by visiting

Tailored Advertising:
Tailored Advertising, also known as online behavioral, interest-based, or relevant advertising, is a form of automated, tailored advertising used to deliver tailored ads when using online services, like ads you see in mobile apps or on websites. We work with ad companies that may serve ads for us, and for others, across your use of online services. We and these companies may use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our and other websites. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track online activities and deliver ads and content tailored to your interests as part of our, our advertisers’ and third parties’ advertising programs. You can opt-out of tailored advertising from other companies who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by going to the DAA’s
Consumer Choice Page

Opt-Out Preference Signal (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Texas Only):
If you access a DIRECTV website from an IP address associated with one of the states listed in this section and have an opt-out preference signal (like the Global Privacy Control) that we recognize enabled in your browser, then we will process that signal and apply it as your cross-context behavioral advertising (in California) and universal opt out mechanism (in Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Texas) preference. This means that we will suppress targeted and cross-context behavioral advertising cookies on your device and set a Do Not Track cookie to identify your preference if you visit our website without your signal on.

Your Privacy Choices

Retention of your personal information.
We keep records and personal information for specified periods of time, depending on business needs, privacy interests and our legal compliance obligations.

After such period, the data is deleted or fully anonymized:
Personal information collected for purposes like maintaining your account (like sales and billing information) is retained while we have a relationship with you plus a period of no more than 10 years after that relationship ends;
Personal information collected for marketing purposes is generally retained for a maximum period of 6 years; and
Personal information collected for customer service purposes is generally retained for a maximum of 3 years or 2 years after our relationship ends (depending on the information).

For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share and protect the information consistently with this Policy, including honoring your communications preferences, when marketing their products and services, your advertising consents, and any state-specific privacy rights you may have. When we combine DIRECTV information with information that comes from an affiliate that has a different privacy policy, the DIRECTV Privacy Policy applies to our use of the combined data.
Service providers
.
We share information that identifies you personally with non-DIRECTV companies that provide services to us, like security, fraud prevention, and analytics, or that support the Products and Services provided to you and that help us run the business, including advertising, marketing, ad delivery services, information technology, engineering, sales and service, and customer care. We do not allow those vendors to use information about you in an identifiable form for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us consistent with this Policy.
We also share information with advertising service providers that use data about you to show you tailored ads based on your interests and to otherwise market our Products and Services.
Advertisers
.
We show ads from other companies on our Products and Services, and we share information with third parties for tailored advertising and other advertising purposes. Those third parties may include advertisers and their agents, programmers and networks, social media networks, analytics firms (companies that measure and analyze consumer behavior), advertising service providers (companies that deliver and track ads for advertisers across websites, applications, and devices), and other similar companies that are involved in creating, delivering, and measuring the performance of advertisements.
The advertisements that you see may be tailored to your interests based on information we collect through the App, Device, Set-Top Box, or that we obtain from third parties relating to: (i) your use of our Products and Services (including your use of the App, your Device, and your Set-Top Box, which may include what apps are accessed and location information), (ii) your relationships with companies that advertise on our Products and Services, (iii) the advertisements or content you viewed, (iv) your online activities, and (v) household, location, and demographic information. To facilitate those ads, we don’t share information with advertisers that can directly identify you, such as your name or postal address. Instead, we and our advertisers share limited information with third-party service providers who employ a matching process that connects information about your interests (for example, coffee-lover or sports enthusiast) to identifiers (like operating system, including Apple or Android ID, or other similar identifiers) that do not identify you personally but instead are associated with your browser or devices and are used to serve you tailored ads. We may also compile and provide reports, including in encrypted, aggregated, or de-identified forms, to advertisers about the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
We may also sell or share the information we collect, including your viewing information, demographic information, and information about your general and specific interests, with business customers for their own advertising or marketing uses, or for use in their advertising products and services for advertisers and other clients. That use includes supporting tailored advertising on other, non-DIRECTV services, like other websites and streaming platforms. When we sell or share your information, we do not share personal information that directly identifies you and our agreements require the information we send to be anonymized, aggregated or made pseudonymous before it is shared or integrated into third-party products. We do not allow business customers to use directly identifying information in their services and we require compliance with applicable privacy laws.
Our sharing of your information for advertising may be considered a “sale” of personal information under certain state privacy laws. For more details on how we share your information for advertising, please see our
Advertising Notice
. To exercise choices about our use of information for advertising, please visit
Your Privacy Choices

Media research companies
.
We share viewing, demographic, and household information tied to identifiers that do not identify you personally, including information collected through our App, Devices, and Set-Top Boxes with media research companies who may combine the shared data with other data characteristics they have obtained including from other video programming distributors or their own sourced household panels, to provide measurement and audience analysis services, and to give them better insight into TV viewing trends, such as national or regional viewing statistics and TV ratings. When we do, we may share data with third-party matching providers that will safely replace information that directly identifies you with an identifier that does not directly identify you or will anonymize the data before delivery to the media research companies or advertising partners. We require media research companies to agree that they will not attempt to identify any person using this information, and that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy. Such sharing with media research companies may be considered a “sale” of data under certain state privacy laws. To exercise choices about our use of information, including to opt-out of “sales” under certain state privacy laws, please visit

Location information.
We collect and share location information, for example to provide access to local programming, such as local news and sports, and advertising. Without your location information, we may not be able to provide access to certain services and features, including live local channels or other content with geographic restrictions. We may use your location to deliver certain features, such as the channel guide. This data may also be used to tailor advertising to you based on your location. You may have the right to control location tracking within our mobile Apps or other services through options provided on the specific app or service. If you disable location tracking on your device, you acknowledge and agree the App may determine your location, such as using your public IP address, to determine your general location for purposes of delivering services.
In connection with a transaction.
If we sell all or parts of our business, make the transfer of assets, or otherwise might be involved in a change of control transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer information to one or more third parties as a part of the transaction, including the due diligence process.
To regulators, law enforcement, for litigation purposes, and for legal compliance.

Enable Global Privacy Control to communicate your privacy preference.
Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.
Get Involved
GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.
View Full Spec
Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
