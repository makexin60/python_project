ZINIO may disclose your Personal Information to a third party for a business purpose or when they integrate with the
  Services through an API or other means. When we disclose Personal Information for a business purpose, we enter a
  contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and
  not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. We contractually require these third parties to keep
  Personal Information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
Disclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose
We may use or disclose the Personal Information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:

    information to request a price quote or ask a question about our products or services, we will use that Personal
    Information to respond to your inquiry. If you provide your Personal Information to purchase a product or service,
    we will use that information to process your payment and facilitate delivery. We may also save your information to
    facilitate new product orders or provide support.

    of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Sales of Personal Information
In the preceding twelve (12) months, ZINIO has not sold Personal Information it has received by and through the
  Services to any third party. However, we have de-identified and aggregated certain information for both internal and

  service experience or other transaction.
Your Rights and Choices
The CCPA provides consumers with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your
  CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Access to Specific Information
You have the right to request that ZINIO disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your
  Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
  request (see Exercising Access and Deletion Rights), we will disclose to you:
The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.
The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you.
Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that ZINIO delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and
  retained, subject to certain exceptions including regulatory data retention requirements. Once we receive and confirm
  your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal
  Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you
    requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or
    otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute
    those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with
    us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided
    it.
Exercising Access, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us
  through the Services, by telephone at +1 (855) 979-4646, or by email at
dataprotection@zinio.com
. Only you may make a
  verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on
  behalf of your minor child or as a user of the Services with regards to ZINIO as your Service Provider (meaning at the
  request of an individual whose Personal Information you have provided to us in the normal course of and purpose for
  using the Services).
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
  request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
    Personal Information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or
  authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
We do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates
  to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or
  authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require
  more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account
  with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.
  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive,
  or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision
  and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request
Data Security
We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
  access, use, alteration, and disclosure.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a
  password for access to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We
  ask you not to share your password with anyone, or use common passwords across multiple sites
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to
  protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information
  transmitted to the Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for
  circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained within the Services.

The Services are not intended for children under 16 years of age. No one under age 16 may provide any Personal
  Information to or in the Services. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 16. If you are
  under 16, do not use or provide any information through the Sites, the Services or through any of its features,
  register on the Sites or Services, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address,
  telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or
  received Personal Information from a child under 16, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any
  information from or about a child under 16, please contact us as set forth below.

ZINIO reserves the right to amend this Privacy Notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this
  Privacy Notice, we will post the updated notice with the applicable effective date. Your continued use of the Services
  following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

Privacy Policy
Last Updated:
January 6, 2025
This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Crazy Egg, Inc. (“Crazy Egg”, “we”, “us”, “our”) on our websites located at the domains crazyegg.com, crazyeggvcr.com, and crazyeggproxy.com, as well as such other websites or mobile applications that we own or operate (individually and collectively, “Our Website” or the “Crazy Egg Website”).
Scope of this Privacy Policy
As further discussed, below, data protection laws, regulations, and directives in certain jurisdictions distinguish between the rights and responsibilities of “Controller(s)” of personal information or data (“Information”), from those who are “Processor(s)” of such Information or data on the applicable controllers’ behalf. Crazy Egg is generally the controller of Information that it collects from and about the persons and entities who are visiting Our Website (“Crazy Egg Visitors”), and this Privacy Policy applies to Crazy Egg Visitors.
We also provide certain services to commercial persons and entities (each, a “Client” and collectively, “Clients”), who, in turn, own and operate their own websites or mobile applications (“Client Site(s)”), and who wish to utilize our code, software and services and reports (the “Service(s)”) to analyze how third party visitors to their Client Sites (“Client Site Visitor(s)”) use, interact with, and engage their Client Sites. The applicable Clients are the Controllers of Information collected from their Client Site Visitors, whether or not such information is accessed, analyzed, or otherwise utilized by or on behalf of the Client via the Service (“Client Visitor Information”); Crazy Egg is not the Controller of such Client Visitor Information. This Privacy Policy applies to the use of Services by our Clients. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the Client Sites themselves, nor to any Client Visitor Information. For any questions regarding the privacy, security, or other practices or policies on the Client Sites, please contact the applicable Client.
Information Collected from Crazy Egg Visitors
Device Information from Crazy Egg Visitors
We may receive and collect certain Information furnished by the visitor's browser or otherwise by their access device (“Device Information”), such as:
Browser Information
Operating System Information
Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.)
IP address (stored in anonymized form)
Page Accessed
Geographic Location
Time of visit (by day, week, and duration)
Whether the visitor is a new or return visitor
Other such Information as may be delivered or shared by the applicable browser or access software or device.
Referral Information
We may also receive certain information regarding visitors from the prior website visited by such visitors (“Referral Information”). For instance, if a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from another website, Crazy Egg may receive certain information from the referring website (i.e., the last website the visitor visited before visiting the Crazy Egg Website) as part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP") request. For example, if a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from a search engine, Crazy Egg may receive information contained in the referring URL for the applicable search query, such as the terms the Crazy Egg Visitor was searching for before visiting the Crazy Egg Website.
Registration Information from Crazy Egg Clients
When Crazy Egg Visitors register as Clients to use the Crazy Egg Service, register to use a trial version of the Crazy Egg Service, or request additional information about Crazy Egg, Crazy Egg may require Information, such as name, employer or company name, e-mail, mailing address, phone number, financial information (e.g., credit card number, billing address), and/or proposed Client Site to be tracked, to process the registration or request ("Client Registration Information").
Session Recording Information
We may use session recording software on the Crazy Egg Website. This software enables us to record Crazy Egg Visitors’ use, interaction, and engagement with the Crazy Egg Website. This software may capture user input, such as mouse and keyboard inputs and mobile gestures, and user views, such as browser or screen output. We use this software to help us optimize Crazy Egg Visitors’ experience. By using the Crazy Egg Website, you consent to our use of session recording software.
Crazy Egg’s Use of Crazy Egg Visitor Information
Crazy Egg may use Information of Crazy Egg Visitors, including Device Information and Referral Information of Crazy Egg Visitors and Client Registration Information, to:
authenticate Client’s access to the Crazy Egg Site, trial versions, or Service;
process and fulfill Client requests or purchases;
register Client accounts;
check the Crazy Egg Visitor’s qualifications for registration and/or to bill Crazy Egg Clients for the Services.
Crazy Egg may also use Client Information to:
provide Crazy Egg's products and Services, personalize and tailor your experience on the Crazy Egg Website;
operate our business;
understand how Clients are engaging with Crazy Egg Website and Service;
request additional information necessary to process or fulfill an order;
assess Client satisfaction with the Crazy Egg Service;
inform Clients that an upgrade is available; or to contact Clients with information about Crazy Egg, including information about new or existing products and services or special offers. For example, we may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our products and Services to the email address associated with a registered account.
Otherwise for our legitimate business interests.
If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, Crazy Egg may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Data”.
Use of Cookies by the Service
As described in our Cookie Policy, the Service may utilize first-party cookies (small text files that Crazy Egg stores locally on a Client Site Visitor’s device) on Client Sites for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify whether a Client Site Visitor is a first time visitor, or has visited previously (provided that we will not store identifiers that can be used to personally identify such Client Site Visitors); assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify preferences; diagnose problems with our Service; analyze trends; and otherwise administer Crazy Egg products and services.
