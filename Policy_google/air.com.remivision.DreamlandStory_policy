We process your Personal Data when you contact us, play the Game or use other Services offered by us.
We respect your privacy and strive in such cases to follow best practices in the area of processing your Personal Data – in particular in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, also known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
This Privacy and Cookies Policy explains who we are, how we process your Personal Data, what cookies we use, what your rights are in this regard and how you can contact us if you need to.
The Privacy and Cookies Policy has been created for information purposes only, which means that it does not give rise to any legal obligations either for you or for the Service Provider (it is not a contract).

What Personal Data do we collect, what is the purpose, duration and legal basis of the processing?
WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME
When you play the Game, we may use cookies and other related technology (see section VI of this Privacy and Cookies Policy for details), which allows us to maintain the proper functioning of the Games and to analyse information about your activity in the Game. We process this data to improve the quality of the services we offer and to improve the functioning of the Game. It may also be the case that cookies (or similar files) help us tailor the content available through the Game to your interests (profiling). We may use certain cookies for marketing purposes, both in the App or on the websites of our business partners.
In general, the legal basis for the use of cookies and similar technologies is your consent.
However, the basis for processing data that has been collected using cookie technology is our legitimate interest or that of a so-called “third party” (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR – among other things, the need to ensure the highest quality of the content, and sometimes also the marketing of our or our partners' products and services, in which case the partners are not involved in the processing of your data. To the extent that also our partners may have direct access to this information – the legal basis for such processing is your freely given consent (Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR).
We process your Personal Data on the basis of your consent until you withdraw it. Your Personal Data processed on the basis of our legitimate interest may be stored until you object to its processing, except where, despite your objection, we conclude that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing overriding your interests, rights and freedoms, or grounds for establishing, exercising
or defending claims.
The above does not apply if the use of cookies and similar files is necessary for the correct operation of the Game (to provide you with an electronic service), where we rely on the law and, as applicable, the necessity of the processing for the performance of the Service Agreement (Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR). Your Personal Data is then processed for the period necessary for these purposes.
Information about the recipients of your Personal Data, including the possible transfer of your Personal Data to third countries (outside the European Economic Area), is detailed in section IV below.
The rights you have in relation to the processing of your Personal Data are detailed in section VI below.
USING SERVICES – ACCOUNT, GAMES WHEN YOU ARE LOGGED-IN AND VIRTUAL VALUES
In order to use the Services (e.g., create an Account, participate in Games via Account or purchase Virtual Values) you may be required to provide certain Personal Data, such as name, surname, email address. The provision of all information is voluntary, however, some data is necessary to enter into a Service Agreement and failure to provide such data may mean that it is not possible to enter into such agreement.
Your Personal Data that is not required may help us in improving our Services. We may also use it for statistical purposes.
The purpose and the legal basis of the processing is the conclusion and proper performance of a Service Agreement (Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR) – for example, the creation of an Account for you, enabling you to participate in the Game via Account or to purchase Virtual Values and the storage of your Game history.
Your data may also be processed for the purpose of marketing activities, such as presenting you with advertisements and offers (discounts), also tailored to your interests on the basis of profiling (legal basis for these activities: Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, i.e. the legitimate interest of the Controller or a third party [the Controller's own marketing or that of its partners]).
We may also process your Personal Data to detect and prevent any threats to privacy, fraud or other bad faith activity and to establish, exercise
and defend claims that may arise in the course of the relationship between you and the Controller. In this case, the legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR). We may also process some of your Personal Data to fulfil legal obligations arising from applicable laws, for example, tax and accounting obligations – the legal basis for the processing is the need to comply with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR).
We will process your Personal Data for the duration of the Service Agreement (although for greater protection, it may be deleted three years after your last activity via Services). This period may be extended as appropriate in connection with possible claims (within the limitation period prescribed by law, in particular the Civil Code) or legal proceedings – for the duration and settlement thereof, and if the law obliges us in certain cases to process a given type of data for a longer period. In any event, the longer retention period for Personal Data will apply.
Your Personal Data processed on the basis of our legitimate interest may be processed until you object to its processing, except where, despite your objection, we conclude that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing overriding your interests, rights and freedoms, or grounds for establishing, exercising or defending claims.
Information about the recipients of your Personal Data, including the possible transfer of your Personal Data to third countries (outside the European Economic Area), is detailed in section IV below.
The rights you have in relation to the processing of your Personal Data are detailed in section VI below.
SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILE
Your Personal Data, including those you provide when visiting our social media profiles (such as comments, likes, internet identifiers), are or may be processed for the following purposes:
facilitating your activity on the profile, effectively managing our profile by providing information about our initiatives and other activities, and promoting various events, services, and products, including those of our partners – legal basis: Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, i.e., the legitimate interests pursued by the Data Controller or a third party, such as promoting the brand and improving the quality of services provided;
marketing activities of the Data Controller or our partners, such as presenting advertisements and offers (discounts), also tailored to your needs based on profiling (we may analyze your activity in a simplified way to better adapt to specific, general groups of our customers). Legal basis for the aforementioned activities: Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, i.e., the legitimate interests of the Data Controller or a third party (own marketing of the Data Controller or our partners);
Providing Personal Data is voluntary, but it may be necessary to fully utilize the functionality of our social media profiles.
Your Personal Data will be processed for the period necessary to achieve the above purposes or until you effectively object, and also for the time required by legal regulations (e.g., tax, accounting), unless a longer period results from their storage in case of potential claims, for the limitation period specified by legal provisions, especially the civil code. In each case, the longer storage period of Personal Data will apply.
Information about the recipients of your Personal Data, including any transfers of your Personal Data to third countries (outside the European Economic Area), are detailed in point IV below.
Your rights in connection with the processing of your Personal Data are detailed in point V below.
CONTACT WITH US
When you contact us, for example, via email, available forms, social media, etc., examples of your Personal Data that we may process include: your Personal Data that identifies you (e.g. email address, IP number, etc.), contact metadata (e.g. date of contact, duration of our conversation), and the content of our communications (e.g. content of emails). Your Personal Data is processed to answer your enquiry, to improve our communication, to enhance customer service and for marketing purposes.
The purpose of the processing and the legal basis for the processing depends on the context of the communication. If you contact us only to obtain general information, e.g. about the Services, we will process your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest (arising from the purposes mentioned above; Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR). However, in the event that your enquiry leads to the conclusion of a Service Agreement, the relevant legal basis for the processing will be Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR – taking steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. If a contract is already in place and you contact us about its performance, the basis for our actions is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR – necessity for the performance of a contract.
We may also process your Personal Data for the purpose of establishing, exercising or defending claims – the legal basis for the processing is respectively our legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR).
Providing your Personal Data is voluntary, but necessary to communicate with us effectively.
If your Personal Data has only been collected in connection with our current communications, we may process it, depending on the category of individual information, for a period ranging from a few days to several months (more specific enquiries and conversations that may be relevant to our contact in the future).
Your Personal Data processed on the basis of our legitimate interest may be stored until you object to its processing, except where, despite your objection, we conclude that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing overriding your interests, rights and freedoms, or grounds for establishing, exercising or defending claims.
The protection and use of Personal Data by social media sites that you might use when contacting us is described in their privacy policies. For example, information on the processing of Personal Data by Facebook can be found at: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
Information about the recipients of your Personal Data, including the possible transfer of your Personal Data to third countries (outside the European Economic Area), is detailed in section IV below.
The rights you have in relation to the processing of your Personal Data are detailed in section VI below.
MARKETING
Your Personal Data provided by you, but also other data collected in connection with your activity in the Game and the use of our Services, are or may be processed for the purposes connected with marketing, analytical and statistical activities of the Controller or its partners or other so-called third parties with whom we cooperate, e.g. presenting you advertisements and offers (discounts), also tailored to your interests based on profiling (in a simplified way, we analyze your activity, e.g. the history of your purchases and behaviour in the Game, so that we can better adapt not only to specific, general groups of our clients, but also to your preferences). However, our actions do not significantly influence your decisions - legal basis: Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, i.e. legitimate interest of the Controller or a third party.
Who has access to your Personal Data?
Access to your personal data will be given exclusively to our appropriately authorized employees or associates, our vendors, partners, consultant or auditors and only to the extent necessary to perform their responsibilities.
Only
entities that support us in operating the Services and Games under appropriate agreements, such as entities that provide hosting/IT services or tools to enable our communications, marketing campaigns, our advisors, including legal counsel, entities that provide accounting and online payment services, will receive access to your Personal Data.
All these entities will have access only to the information necessary for their activities.
The recipients of your personal data may also be entities specified by us in point VI, especially if you log in to our Services via Apple ID or Facebook account. Depending on the circumstances of the specific case, these entities may act as data controllers for your personal data or as entities processing the entrusted data.
The recipients of your personal data may also include operators of the Platforms on which the App/the Game is made available (e.g. App Store, Google Play, and Facebook). In case you use the Game in a way that other users of the Game may have access to your personal data, such as by publishing results or other information regarding your participation in the Game, those users may also be recipients of your data.
Some of those providing solutions to us may be established outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer data outside the EEA, we apply the required security measures, including standard data-protection clauses adopted under a decision of the European Commission, with appropriate safeguards. You may contact us to receive a copy of the safeguards used by us concerning the personal data transfer to countries outside EEA.
We may also be required – if there is a legal basis to do so – to provide certain information to public authorities, for purposes related to proceedings they are conducting.

What are cookies and other similar technologies? How and for what purpose do we use them?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device when you visit the Game and, for example, store information about your use of the Game. We use cookies and other technology to recognise you as a returning User, to improve the quality of our service and to collect statistical data, and for marketing purposes. We also process them to analyse the popularity and effectiveness of our offers.
The cookie technology (or similar functionality) we use collects information about each visitor of the
Game. Please note that the information below applies to persons who use the Game, regardless of whether they have placed an Order or have an Account.
The information collected in cookies will not necessarily constitute Personal Data within the meaning of the GDPR. However, some information, depending on its content and use, may be linked to a specific person (attribution of certain behaviours to a specific person, e.g. by linking them to the data provided at the time of Account registration), and thus be considered Personal Data.
Of course, you can change the way cookies are used, including blocking them completely or deleting them via your browser settings. However, you should remember that this type of action may prevent or significantly hinder the proper functioning of our Games, for example, by significantly slowing it down, so we recommend that you do not disable cookies in your browser.
We provide you with information that explains precisely which cookies we use and for what purposes in the Game.
We use two types of cookies in the Games: session cookies, which remain stored on your computer or mobile device until you log off, and permanent cookies, which remain on your device for the time specified in the parameters of the cookies or until they are manually deleted in your software.
Depending on the circumstances, we may use the following types of cookies, without limitation:
Technical – necessary for the proper functioning of the Game and the functionalities available within the Game; adapting and optimising the Games to your needs; these cookies are not used to track visitors of the Game;
Analytical/performance – used to analyse your behaviour in the Game, for statistical and analytical purposes; they help us to achieve our legitimate aims of improving the way our site works; for example, by ensuring that Users can easily find what they are looking for;
Marketing – used to analyse your behaviour; they provide information that identifies you, including for marketing purposes within third party websites; we will use this information, taking into account your choices and preferences, to make our site and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.
To see a detailed description of the cookies we use, click the relevant box in the cookies bar.
We may work with other companies on their marketing (advertising) activities. For the purposes of this collaboration, your browser or other software installed on your device may also place cookies from entities conducting such marketing activities and those entities may become the controllers of your Personal Data (these are called “third party cookies”). Cookies sent by these entities are intended to ensure that you are presented with only those advertisements that match your individual interests and needs. We believe that displaying personalised advertising may be more attractive to you than advertising that is unrelated to your needs. This would not be possible without these files, as it is the companies working with us that provide advertising content for you.

Security is an essential part of our product inside and out. From strict checkpoints in our security development lifecycle to continuous monitoring of our infrastructure and applications, we make sure our platform is secure 24/7/365. We’ve also implemented extensive measures to make sure your experience is safe and secure every time you log in to your account.
The cloud is an extension of our business. That’s why we only work with partners like AWS and GCP who hold the same high standards security and compliance as we do. We monitor environments across data centers using multi-layered controls to help protect our infrastructure in addition to anti-DDoS protection, WAF, API protection tools, and continuous 24/7 monitoring.
Making sure your data is fresh, accurate is our number one priority. That’s why we’ve created a business continuity plan that ensures critical operations and services are always available. Our services are hosted on a globally distributed network that provides continuous activity and provide multiple backups, allowing our servers to remain resilient in the event of significant failures.
Data security is a critical part of our efforts to help both you and your users. Our web servers support strong encryption protocols to secure connections between customer devices and our web services and APIs. All data is encrypted, both in transit and at rest leaving no vulnerabilities. There are also additional advanced options such as IP masking which you can implement at any time.
“We’re always on high alert. Always. We check and recheck our activity and seek to improve ourselves in every aspect in order to protect our systems. We don’t just check boxes, we are constantly thinking about how we can expand and go beyond.”

Introduction
AppsFlyer provides attribution and marketing analytics services (“
Services
“) that enable advertisers and developers (collectively, “
Customer(s)
“) to: (i) measure and analyze the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by understanding which marketing campaigns contributed to the download/installation of their mobile applications (“
Applications
“) or such other conversion metric (e.g. relaunch of Application); and (ii) measure and analyze certain events and actions within their Application or websites, such as in-app purchases made by End Users (as defined below). The Services also help our Customers identify and protect against fraudulent behavior related to their marketing campaigns.
This Services Privacy Policy describes AppsFlyer’s privacy practices in relation to the information collected from Customers and End Users and received by AppsFlyer when Customers use our Services. This Services Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through use of AppsFlyer’s publicly accessible website or marketing activities, which is described under our Privacy Policy. To view the Privacy Policy, please
click here
. Furthermore, AppsFlyer and its Customers have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by AppsFlyer and their use by Customers (“
Agreement(s)
“). Such Agreements may contain additional obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information. Nothing in this Services Privacy Policy derogates from such additional obligations.
For the purpose of this Services Privacy Policy: (i) any reference to “
End User(s)
” means end users who have interacted with, or viewed, Customer’s advertising and marketing materials, or use or have used Customer’s Applications, websites, products and services; and (ii) any reference to “
AppsFlyer
” “
we
” “
us
” or “
our
” shall mean AppsFlyer Ltd. and its affiliates.
End User Data Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer uses the Services, the following End User information may be received and processed by AppsFlyer (collectively, “
End User Data
”).
“
Technical Information
”: this refers to technical information related to an End User’s mobile device or computer, such as: browser type, device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.
“
Technical Identifiers
”: this refers to various unique identifiers that generally only identify a computer, device, browser or Application. For example, IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices); Google Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique identifiers.
“
Engagement Information
”: this refers to information relating to the Customer’s ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer’s website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyze within their Application or website (e.g. add to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).
While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information (“
PII
“), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such. Within the scope of the engagement between Customers and AppsFlyer, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by AppsFlyer. However, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII. This includes, for example, a Customer using an End User’s email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier. If a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.
Registration Information Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer registers to use the Services, we may collect certain information related to such Customer (“
Registration Information
” and together with the End User Data, “
Customer Data
”), including Customer name and Customer details, billing information and names and contact details of Customer employees and representatives who are using the Services (e.g. email, phone number and address). When a Customer uses the Services, AppsFlyer may also collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Customer is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g. browser type, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Customer (“
