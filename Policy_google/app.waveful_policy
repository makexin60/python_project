Privacy Policy
Hi üëã
I'm Waveful, the creator-friendly social network where everyone can become a creator üåä
Before diving in a more formal explanation of our privacy policy, let me briefly tell you my mission üöÄ
My goal is to be a social network where everyone can share their passions and feel welcomed in a comfortable and positive environment; where creators can thrive and where users can enjoy original content, find new meaningful connections and have fun. I hope I'm doing well in this, but you be the judge!
I collect data using the latest industry security standards, and the collected data is used with the only goal of delivering the best experience a social network can offer üì°
Waveful does not sell your data and will never do. In fact, to be sustainable, Waveful has some paid elements in the platform (purchasable likes and premium subscriptions). I know some users don't like to pay for a service, but the core functionalities of Waveful are free and will always remain free, and you can still enjoy the Waveful experience without spending a single cent!
Now I'll leave you to a more formal explanation of our data collection practices, and thanks for being here!
And if you need any help on understanding any part of this privacy policy, send us a message at support@waveful.app, will be happy to help you ‚ú®
