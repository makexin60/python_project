California residents have the right to obtain access to their Personal Data (if Tenorshare is processing it), and other certain information (similar to that provided in this privacy policy).
California residents have the right to request that businesses stop selling or sharing their personal information (“opt-out”), including via a user-enabled global privacy control. Businesses cannot sell or share your personal information after they receive your opt-out request unless you later authorize them to do so again.
Each California resident has the right to request, subject to certain exceptions described in the CCPA, that we disclose to that resident:
The categories of personal information we have collected about them;
The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we have shared personal information;
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them (collectively, a “Request to Know”).
California residents have the right to restrict our use of Sensitive Personal Information collected about them.
In the past twelve months, we have collected, and in the future, we will continue to collect, the categories of personal information cited in the section entitled “The personal information we collect” above. This includes the following categories of personal information set out in the CCPA: identifiers, personal information described in Section 1798.80 of the California Civil Code, characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law, Internet or other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, professional or employment-related information, and sensitive personal information. We collect and use this information from the sources described in the section entitled “How we collect your information, how we use it, and what information we collect from you” above, and share this information with third parties as described in the section entitled “How we share, transfer, and disclose your personal information” above.

Authorized agents.
California residents have the right to designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on their behalf.  Prior to completing a request made by such an authorized agent, we require that you provide your authorized agent with written permission to submit such a request and require that you or your authorized agent provide us with a copy of such written permission.  Additionally, we require that you verify your identity pursuant to the procedure described above.

We retain personal information of different types, or relating to different categories of people, for different periods, taking into account its business purpose. For example, information about individuals who have applied for employment with us will be retained for a shorter period than information about individuals who have actually worked for us.
The periods for which we retain information are based on the requirements of applicable data protection laws and the purpose for which the information is collected and used.  We take into account legal and regulatory provisions which require information to be retained for a minimum period.
