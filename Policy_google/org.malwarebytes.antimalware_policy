Malwarebytes Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 14, 2025
We believe you have the right to a malware-free existence. We also believe just as strongly that you have the right to privacy and control over your information. This fundamental belief shapes our Privacy Policy.
We will be clear about the data we collect and why. We do not and will not sell your data to third parties. Our primary purpose in collecting your data is to be able to equip you with effective products and services that provide a more agile, dynamic response to new and unknown threats.
This Privacy Policy applies to Malwarebytes websites and products and describes how Malwarebytes collects, uses, shares and secures your personal information. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
Please, if you have any questions or suggestions, don’t hesitate to contact us at
privacy@malwarebytes.com
.
Caution: Legalese ahead.
When do we collect your information?
We may collect your information: (1) when you license and use our software (“Software Collection”); (2) when you interact with certain portions of our website, such as our forums, blogs, and support center (“Website Collection”); (3) when you communicate or interact with us by email, chat, or otherwise (“Dialogue Collection”); and (4) when you apply to work for us (“Job Applicant Collection”)
Simply
We collect your information when you use our software, website, or otherwise communicate with us.
What information do we collect?
We may collect both personal information and non-personal information. personal information is information that is either expressly provided by you, such as your name, or information that can be used either alone or in combination with other information to personally identify you, such as your email address, phone number, and user name.
We may collect the following personal information from you: Contact Information (such as name, email address, mailing address, or phone number); Unique Identifiers (such as username and password used for authenticating your Malwarebytes accounts and products) and machine identification numbers, Internet protocol (IP) addresses,; Information about your business (such as company name, company size, business type) and; Information related to your usage of our products as described in the next section, below.
Our service providers may collect billing information (credit card number and billing address) on our behalf to process orders.
Non-personal information is all information that is not personal information or is information that was personal information but which we modify and/or aggregate with other data in order to make it Non-personal information. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate, and/or other metadata associated with your machine and usage activities and anonymously generated device identifiers and administer the site.
Simply
There are two types of information we collect: personal and non-personal.
Software Collection – information collected when using our security software
User-Agent String
Each API communication coming from any of our client software identifies itself with a string that includes information about the software itself:
The program and build which is sending the      request
The current license state (as identified by the product)
The version of the software as well as any subcomponents (currently, databases) that it uses
Why?
So we can manage your Malwarebytes product and ensure that it is up to date.
GeoIP Data
When we collect data from our client systems, we do not store IP address from which the request originates. . However, we do use it to gather geographic information on the system calling in:
A location item indicating the continent, country, city, and approximate latitude/ longitude of the user based on your IP address
The type of connection (dialup/broadband/satellite/mobile)
The ISP through which the connection is made
The organization to which the IP address is licensed, if any
Why?
So our malware intelligence team can track malware and potentially unwanted program (“PUP”) outbreaks and patterns.
Functional Data
We collect data that is necessary for the functionality of the software or for our performance of providing the software to you. For example, we may need to collect system processes and behaviors in order to perform system rollback and recovery operations.
Why?
So our products are able to function as intended, including being able to detect and remediate malware and PUPs, and provide rollback and recovery operations.
Client Data
In addition to functional data, we collect client data from each program that describe the client environment (i.e., our software and the computer system it is running on). In this, we collect:
The operating system the program is installed on
The system language in use on that system
The processor architecture (i.e., 32- or 64-bit)
The file system in use (i.e., FAT32)
Information from the Windows Security/Action Center, including security settings and programs installed or in use
Information about other Malwarebytes program settings and how they are configured
Information about how you use our software or services (“Log Data”) including use of integrations with our products
Why?
So we can gather performance data around our products and how they operate in relation to different hardware and software environments. By having this data, we can improve our products as well as optimize them for the various system configurations that our users are using.
Machine Identification Data
We identify each system by assigning each system with a Malwarebytes-generated distinct identifier that is created at install time.
Why?
So we are able to get an accurate count of our install base. We are also able to identify changes to an individual system over time, allowing us to recognize trends which are used for improving our products.
License Data
We collect data from products corresponding to the products’ applicable license state. These data also use a unique identifier. In this, we collect:
The key or keys used to license the current product
The type of license being used
If it represents a console system, the number of seats being managed by that installation of the console
Endpoint and network domain information
Why?
So we can remind you when your Malwarebytes subscription is about to expire or to determine the correct license type. We may use such license data in conjunction with other software collection to assist you in resolving licensing issues.
Malware and PUP Data
We collect data about the malware and PUPs that are detected by our products. We collect:
The vendor name of the malware or PUP removed
An encrypted description of which database rule was used to remove the malware or PUP in question
Artifacts detected as malware, PUPs, or suspicious files
Information related to detected artifacts
Why?
So our malware intelligence team can track malware and PUP outbreaks and improve the efficacy of Malwarebytes products.
Trial Data
When a client attempts to start a trial, we track it remotely in order to validate that the trial is allowed. For this information we use another unique system identifier. We collect:
The client’s request for a trial
The start date and duration of the trial provided
Any attempted conversion/purchase generated by clicking an in-app link, so that it can be correlated with a trial
Why?
So we can update your Malwarebytes products accurately and when they need it.
Exploit Data
In Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit products we collect a complex data object for any exploit process which is blocked by the software. In this data we collect:
Process ID of the exploit process
File path of exploit process
MD5 hash of the exploit payload, if any
Command-line arguments passed to the exploit
A list of URLs potentially associated with the exploit, including redirect jumps if any
Exploit payload files
Exploit file-format (doc, pdf, xls, etc…)
(Potentially) a copy of the exploit executable itself
Why?
So our malware intelligence team can track exploit outbreaks and deepen its understanding of new exploit techniques.
Operating System User Account Name and Domain
In certain Malwarebytes business products providing brute-force attack protection, we collect user account names and domain information.
Why?
So that you (as the customer) can see what credentials are being targeted during brute-force attacks.
Port number(s) used for incoming connections.
In certain Malwarebytes business products providing brute-force attack protection, we collect user account names and domain information associated with connections to network port numbers, including, but not limited to, those associated with: remote desktop protocol, FTP, SQL, IMAP, POP3, SMTP.
Why?
So that you (as the customer) can see what ports are being used for connections by different protocols, and improve our products.
Mobile Application Data
When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the unique device identifier.
We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.
We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or Services.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.
As part of our text message filtering functionality, our Mobile Software also collects text messages from senders who are not in your contacts, and analyzes these text messages to determine whether they are malicious. We only receive the sender information and the body of the message which is analyzed to determine if they contain malicious URLs or come from malicious senders; no information is provided about the recipient. Text messages that are malicious are retained for analysis by our researchers, however, all other text messages are discarded. To learn more please visit our

Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Dispute Resolution
JAMS Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Dispute Resolution
The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) were respectively developed in furtherance of transatlantic commerce by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission, the UK Government, and the Swiss Federal Administration to provide U.S. organizations with reliable mechanisms for personal data transfers to the United States from the European Union / European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland while ensuring data protection that is consistent with EU, UK, and Swiss law.
The effective date of the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, including the Supplemental Principles and Annex I of the Principles is July 10, 2023, which is the date of entry into force of the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. DPF. The adequacy decision enables the transfer of EU personal data to participating organizations consistent with EU law.
Effective as of July 17, 2023, eligible organizations in the United States that wish to self-certify their compliance pursuant to the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF may do so; however, personal data cannot be received from the United Kingdom and Gibraltar in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF before the date that the adequacy regulations implementing the data bridge for the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF enter into force. The data bridge will enable the transfer of UK and Gibraltar personal data to participating organizations consistent with UK law.
The effective date of the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, including the Supplemental Principles and Annex I of the Principles is July 17, 2023; however, personal data cannot be received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF until the date of entry into force of Switzerland’s recognition of adequacy for the Swiss-U.S. DPF. The recognition of adequacy will enable the transfer of Swiss personal data to participating organizations consistent with Swiss law.
The Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, which is administered by the International Trade Administration (ITA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce, enables eligible U.S.-based organizations to self-certify their compliance pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF and, as applicable, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF. To participate in the DPF Program, a U.S.-based organization is required to self-certify to the ITA via the Department's DPF Program website (www.dataprivacyframework.gov) and publicly commit to comply with the DPF Principles. While the decision by an eligible U.S.-based organization to self-certify its compliance pursuant to and participate in the relevant part(s) of the DPF Program is voluntary, effective compliance upon self-certification is compulsory. Once such an organization self-certifies to the ITA and publicly declares its commitment to adhere to the DPF Principles that commitment is enforceable under U.S. law. All organizations interested in self-certifying their compliance pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF and, as applicable, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF should review the requirements in their entirety. The Department’s DPF Program website provides useful information regarding the benefits and requirements of participation in the relevant parts of that program.
U.S.-based organizations that self-certify their compliance pursuant to the relevant part(s) of the DPF Program must, amongst other things, provide readily available recourse mechanisms available to investigate unresolved complaints, including a system of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by an independent third party. The independent recourse mechanisms must be in place prior to self-certification, and must be available at no cost to the individual. Although organizations self-certifying their compliance pursuant to the relevant part(s) of the DPF Program may utilize private sector developed dispute resolution programs for most categories of personal data covered under their self-certifications, those organizations covering human resources data (i.e., personal information about employees, past or present, collected in the context of the employment relationship) transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland must agree to cooperate and comply with the EU data protection authorities (DPAs), the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) respectively with regard to such data.
JAMS is available to serve as your organization’s designated ADR provider and to assist in resolving disputes brought under the DPF Principles, up to the point of any final arbitration invoked in accordance with the procedures and conditions set forth in the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles. With a panel of over 400 neutrals around the world, JAMS specializes in resolving disputes of all sizes and levels of complexity and our neutrals have significant experience resolving issues involving privacy.
Mediation Rules

JAMS DOES NOT charge any fees for an organization to name it as an ADR provider. If an organization names JAMS as its ADR provider under the EU-U.S. DPF and, as applicable, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF, we request that you notify JAMS
