Policies Regarding Children Under The Age of 13
​
Please note that this “Policies Regarding Children Under the Age of 13” section only applies to procedures when collecting information from children under the age of 13.
​
We recognise the obligation to protect Personal Information obtained from young children.  The Services are not geared toward children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from such children other than those stated in this section.  If we collect any personal information (as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
”), which was established by U.S. Congress to protect children’s online privacy) from children under the age of 13, we will either (1) comply with the requirements of COPPA and gain prior verifiable parental consent or direct parental notification of the nature and intended use of such information, which shall include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity; or (2) take all reasonable steps to promptly remove from our files and records such information.  For more information about COPPA and children’s rights to online privacy, please visit the Children’s Privacy section of the Federal Trade Commission’s website at
www.business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/childrens-privacy.
​
​In addition, we advise that children over the age of 13 shall ask their parents for permission before transmitting any of their information to anyone over the Internet, and we suggest parents to tell their children not to provide their personal information, without permission, when using the Internet.
​
What types of information do we collect from children?
​
We mainly collect persistent identifier (such as an IP address, mobile device id, or a unique device identifier) from the child.
​
Please note that all sites that are directed to children under the age of 13 are prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a child’s participation in an online activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
​
How do we use and share the personal information collected from children?
​
We use the collected persistent identifier for the sole purpose of providing support for internal operations of the Service, including activities necessary for us to maintain or analyze the functioning of the Services, authenticate users or personalize content, serve contextual advertising or cap the frequency of advertising, protect the security or integrity of the user or the Service, or ensure legal or regulatory compliance.
​
The collected persistent identifier is not shared with other third parties.  However, we may, from time to time contract with certain third party service providers to provide support for the internal operations of the Service.  Your personal information is not used or disclosed by these contracted third party service providers except for the limited service for which they have been contracted.
​
We collect a child’s email address in connection with a question emailed to us by the child for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (e.g. responding to a question from the child).  We will not use or disclose such information to re-contact the child or for any other purpose, and such information will be deleted from our records promptly after responding to the child’s request.  If we choose not to respond to the child’s request, we will immediately delete the child’s information.
​
How can parents review or delete personal information about their child?
At any time, parents of children under the age of 13 may review or delete personal information about their children from our records, or refuse to permit our further collection or use of such personal information.  Please contact us at
Compliance@animocabrands.com
if you would like to review or delete your child’s personal information, or to inform us about your refusal to permit our further collection of such personal information.
​
Whenever a parent requests a deletion of his or her child’s personal information, we will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our records as much as possible and will not collect any other personal information from such child.  Please note that there may be residual information that will remain in our records that may or may not contain the personal information that was requested to be deleted.  Such residual information will not be disclosed or shared with any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.
​
Changes in our Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13?
​
We may amend our Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13 at any time.  We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child’s personal information.  Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us current e-mail addresses.  We will apply material changes in our Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13 only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent.
​
Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK
​
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, you may have additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and other applicable law with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.
​
Personal Information means “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR. “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.

Animoca will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with our Services.
​Linked Third Party Sites’ Privacy Policies
​
Our sites and the Services may contain links to websites of other third parties that we do not own or have any control.  It does not mean that we authorise, sponsor or endorse those third parties, nor is it a representation of our association with them, when we provide such links to other websites.  If you click on such links, including clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, you will leave our site and will be directed to those third parties’ sites.  As we do not have any control over such third parties’ activities, we are not responsible for their websites’ content or privacy practices, the collection or use of your information or any of their products or services.  We cannot provide assurance that such third parties employ the same or similar privacy and security practices as us.  We strongly advise you to review such other websites’ privacy policies, as their privacy policy governs any information you provide to these third parties.  Only information collected on or through the Services is subject to this Privacy Policy.
​
The Services may also contain other third party service providers’ tracking tools.  We may use such third parties’ APIs/SDKs in providing the Services to you, which may allow these third parties to analyze user information.  Although these third parties may have access to your Personal Information when services are performed for us, they may not use such information for any purposes other than to provide their services.
