Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 23, 2024

This Privacy Policy describes how Android Device Manager PI ("we", "us", or "our") handles information collected through the Android Device Manager PI mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Information We Collect

Android Device Manager PI does not collect or store any personal data from users or their devices for its own purposes. The App solely reads data from the Android system API and displays it to the user in text format. This data may include information such as API level, processor name, processor speeds, battery charge, battery capacity, camera megapixel, sensors on the device, wifi network type, and other system-related information.

Data Usage

The data accessed by Android Device Manager PI is used solely for the purpose of displaying system information to the user within the App interface. We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data beyond the current session or interaction with the App.

Data Sharing

Android Device Manager PI does not share any user data with third parties for its own use. The information accessed from the Android system API is used exclusively within the App and is not shared externally.

Advertising

To support our App and provide a free service to our users, we display ads within the App. These ads are served by our advertising partner, who may use data such as device identifiers (including advertising ID) and usage data to serve personalized ads, measure ad performance, and carry out other advertising-related activities.

Our advertising partner may collect and process information about your use of the App, including the types of ads viewed and interactions with ads. This information is used to provide advertising tailored to your interests, to improve ad targeting and effectiveness, and for analytical purposes.

Data Security

While we do not collect or store any user data for our own purposes, we take reasonable measures to ensure the security of the information accessed through the Android system API and any data processed by third-party advertising partners. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure.

Children's Privacy

Android Device Manager PI is not directed at individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, please contact us, and we will promptly delete it.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data practices, legal requirements, or our advertising practices. Any updates will be posted within the App, and your continued use of the App after such changes will signify your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
