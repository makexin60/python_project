Consumer Consent and Choices

By utilizing our Services or providing information about You, You acknowledge and consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. You agree not to provide us with information about any other person unless You have that person’s consent or other legal authority.
Your telephone communications with Us may be recorded or monitored for quality control purposes. By communicating with Us in this manner, You expressly consent to the recording for such purposes.
By providing Us with Your contact information, such as email or telephone number, You agree to be contacted by Us and by the providers we have contracted with to contact You on our behalf. You agree to be contacted by telephone call or text message at the telephone number You provided using automatic telephone dialing systems, even if You previously registered on a Do Not Call registry. Your consent is not a condition of purchase.
Communication Opt-Out or Unsubscribe
You may choose to have Your name taken off of our registration list, cease marketing communications or newsletters from us by using the opt-out option in any marketing emails or text messages You receive from us or contacting us using the information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to Your request within 10 days or as otherwise required by law.
Opting out of one form of communication does not mean You have opted out of other forms as well. For example, if You opt-out of receiving marketing emails, You may still receive marketing text messages if You have opted-in to receiving them.  However, if You submit a general opt-out request on this Site, we will take action to unsubscribe You based upon the information provided.  For example, if You provide Your name, email address, and phone number we will unsubscribe You from any lists linked to either Your name, email address or phone number.
Managing Web Tracking Technologies
Opt-in
When You first visit our site, a banner will appear and request consent to our use of online technologies that are not necessary for the function of our site.  Our site only uses such optional online technologies when You consent by clicking “accept” in the banner.
If you accept the use of tracking technology, then a third party advertiser, search provider or ad network partner may collect information about Your activity on our website, on devices associated with You, and on third-party sites and applications to decide which ads You see both on our websites and applications and on third-party sites and applications.
You may opt-in or opt-out of the placement of optional technology going forwards, at any time, via our Cookie Preferences using this link:
Cookie Preferences
Browser Settings
We generally use local storage ("LS") also referred to as HTML5 to store web content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon Your web browsing activity use local storage to collect and store information. Service providers that collect tracking data on our behalf may provide an opportunity for You to choose not to be tracked online.  Various browsers may also offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LS.
You may be able to adjust Your settings to limit ad tracking (e.g. “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads'' or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android).
You may also be able to control receipt of targeted advertising from many ad networks and partners; data exchanges; and marketing analytics and digital advertising and marketing service providers by visiting the
Digital Advertising Alliance
.
If You are seeing one of our advertisements on a third-party site, such as a social media site, You may also have the option to opt-out of such behavioral advertising through that site’s preference settings. Even if You opt out of personalized advertising, You may still see ads based on factors such as Your general location derived from Your IP address, Your browser type, and Your search terms.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track
is a web browser privacy preference that causes the web browser to broadcast a signal to websites requesting the user's activity that such activity will not be tracked. If You are using a “do not track” function on Your web browser, our cookie manager software will recognize this as an opt-out preference signal, such that we will not collect or share Personal Information we associate with your browser or device for purposes of targeted advertising.
You may choose to enable online, where available, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences, such as the
Global Privacy Control
(“GPC”).
You can also opt out of Google Analytics by installing
Google’s opt-out browser add-on
.  We will process the GPC signal and Google’s opt-out browser add-on as a request to opt out.  When we receive a do not track signal, your opt-out of web tracking technologies will be automatic.

Consumer Consent and Choices
Communications Consent
By utilizing our Services or providing information about You, You acknowledge and consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. You agree not to provide us with information about any other person unless You have that person’s consent or other legal authority.
Your telephone communications with Us may be recorded or monitored for quality control purposes. By communicating with Us in this manner, You expressly consent to the recording for such purposes.
By providing Us with Your contact information, such as email or telephone number, You agree to be contacted by Us and by the providers we have contracted with to contact You on our behalf. You agree to be contacted by telephone call or text message at the telephone number You provided using automatic telephone dialing systems, even if You previously registered on a Do Not Call registry. Your consent is not a condition of purchase.
Communication Opt-Out or Unsubscribe
You may choose to have Your name taken off of our registration list, cease marketing communications or newsletters from us by using the opt-out option in any marketing emails or text messages You receive from us or contacting us using the information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to Your request within 10 days or as otherwise required by law.
Opting out of one form of communication does not mean You have opted out of other forms as well. For example, if You opt-out of receiving marketing emails, You may still receive marketing text messages if You have opted-in to receiving them.  However, if You submit a general opt-out request on this Site, we will take action to unsubscribe You based upon the information provided.  For example, if You provide Your name, email address, and phone number we will unsubscribe You from any lists linked to either Your name, email address or phone number.
Managing Web Tracking Technologies
Opt-in
When You first visit our site, a banner will appear and request consent to our use of online technologies that are not necessary for the function of our site.  Our site only uses such optional online technologies when You consent by clicking “accept” in the banner.
If you accept the use of tracking technology, then a third party advertiser, search provider or ad network partner may collect information about Your activity on our website, on devices associated with You, and on third-party sites and applications to decide which ads You see both on our websites and applications and on third-party sites and applications.
You may opt-in or opt-out of the placement of optional technology going forwards, at any time, via our Cookie Preferences using this link:
Cookie Preferences
Browser Settings
We generally use local storage ("LS") also referred to as HTML5 to store web content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon Your web browsing activity use local storage to collect and store information. Service providers that collect tracking data on our behalf may provide an opportunity for You to choose not to be tracked online.  Various browsers may also offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LS.
You may be able to adjust Your settings to limit ad tracking (e.g. “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads'' or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android).
You may also be able to control receipt of targeted advertising from many ad networks and partners; data exchanges; and marketing analytics and digital advertising and marketing service providers by visiting the
Digital Advertising Alliance
.
If You are seeing one of our advertisements on a third-party site, such as a social media site, You may also have the option to opt-out of such behavioral advertising through that site’s preference settings. Even if You opt out of personalized advertising, You may still see ads based on factors such as Your general location derived from Your IP address, Your browser type, and Your search terms.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track
is a web browser privacy preference that causes the web browser to broadcast a signal to websites requesting the user's activity that such activity will not be tracked. If You are using a “do not track” function on Your web browser, our cookie manager software will recognize this as an opt-out preference signal, such that we will not collect or share Personal Information we associate with your browser or device for purposes of targeted advertising.
You may choose to enable online, where available, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences, such as the
Global Privacy Control
(“GPC”).
You can also opt out of Google Analytics by installing
Google’s opt-out browser add-on
.  We will process the GPC signal and Google’s opt-out browser add-on as a request to opt out.  When we receive a do not track signal, your opt-out of web tracking technologies will be automatic.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC

Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
