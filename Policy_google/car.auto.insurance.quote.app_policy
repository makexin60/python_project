This Privacy Policy (referred to as the “Policy”) governs the
Car Insurance for Auto Owners
mobile application (referred to as the “App”). It is designed to inform users (referred to as “you”) about how the App handles data, including the type of information it collects, how it uses that information, and with whom the information may be shared.
Types of Information Collected
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
We may gather personal information from various sources such as online forms, phone calls, emails, mobile applications, or other means. Examples include but are not limited to your name, address, contact information (phone number, email), vehicle details, driver’s license number, social security number, date of birth, and insurance history.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)
This category includes data collected through cookies, tracking technologies, and IP addresses, which helps us understand how users interact with the App. This information may include IP addresses, browser details, access times, and user interaction with App content. Non-PII data is not linked to your identity and is primarily used for analytical purposes.
How Information Is Used
Use of PII
The App uses the Personally Identifiable Information provided to facilitate the services you’ve requested. This includes delivering quotes, customer support, and marketing tailored to your interests. Your information may be shared with our Insurance Partners or third-party affiliates to provide personalized services and offers.
Use of Non-PII
Non-personal information, like IP addresses and cookies, is used to analyze trends, monitor user engagement, and improve the user experience within the App. This data helps us make improvements based on aggregated, anonymized behavior.
Sharing of Information
Sharing of PII
Your Personally Identifiable Information may be shared with third parties such as insurance providers, marketing partners, and other affiliates. These partners use the information to offer relevant products or services and may have their own privacy policies governing how they handle this data.
The App may also share your information in legal situations, such as complying with subpoenas, court orders, or legal claims, or if needed to investigate fraud, suspected illegal activities, or protect the rights of the App, its users, and associated parties.
Sharing of Non-PII
Non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party vendors and partners for purposes such as analyzing usage patterns or running promotional campaigns. This data remains anonymous and is not linked to any personal details.
Third-Party Advertisements and Tracking
The App may display advertisements from third parties, which could employ cookies or similar technologies to gather information about your interaction with these ads. The App does not share PII with these advertisers, but these third parties may collect data about your device or usage patterns to serve more relevant ads.
Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from minors. If we discover that such data has been inadvertently collected, it will be promptly deleted.
Security Measures
We take the security of your personal data seriously and have implemented various physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard it. While these measures are designed to protect against unauthorized access or misuse, no online system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.
Accessing and Modifying Your Information
If you would like to access or update your Personally Identifiable Information, please contact us via the methods provided at the end of this Policy. We are committed to addressing your requests promptly.
Policy Updates
The App reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be posted on the App, and the “Effective” date will be updated accordingly. You are encouraged to review this Policy regularly to stay informed about how your data is handled.
