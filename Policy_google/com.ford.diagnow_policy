the Android operating system on the
mobile device requires location services to be enabled in order to connect to
Bluetooth devices. To connect via Bluetooth to the VCM Lite, Android mobile
devices need to enable location services. Neither the Ford DiagNow app nor Ford

information about how the
vehicle is operated and used (such as speed, use of accelerator, brakes,

vehicle via the Ford DiagNow app is to be used only for vehicle diagnostics,
service, or repair unless you obtain their consent to use it for other purposes.

help us identify you or associate the information generated through your use of
the app to you.

Our
Sharing of Personal Information
We share
the personal information collected in connection with your
use of
the Ford DiagNow app
with your consent, when you direct us to share it with others,
as necessary to complete your transactions, or to provide the products,
features, services, or experiences you have requested or authorized. In
addition:
Dealers:
if you work
     for a Ford or Lincoln dealer, we share information about the diagnostic
     and service events generated through your use of the app with that dealer.
Affiliates:
we share the personal
     information collected in connection
with your
use of the app
among the
     companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and
     affiliates.
Our
     “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common
     control or ownership. Information is shared within this “family” as a
     normal part of conducting business operations and offering products,
     features, and services to our customers.
Service Providers, Suppliers, and
     Agents:
we
     may share the personal information collected in connection
with your

with
our vendors,
     suppliers, service providers, contractors, and agents (including our
     affiliates acting in this capacity) (“

     behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. We require them to use
     it only to perform that work for us and to use adequate safeguards to protect
     the confidentiality of the personal information they receive. For example,
     companies we've hired to provide customer service or technical support, or
     to support some of the features in the app, may need the personal
     information to provide those functions. Reasonable contractual or other
     measures we may take to protect your personal information while processed
     or handled by Suppliers are subject to legal requirements in the United
     States, Canada, and other foreign countries (for example, lawful
     requirements to disclose personal information to governmental authorities
     in those countries).

     Regulatory Agencies, and Others:
we will share the personal information
     collected in connection

      to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other
      government agencies;
act under exigent circumstances to help
      prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal
      safety of Ford or affiliate personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or

detect, investigate, prevent, or
      otherwise address fraud or privacy issues;
operate and maintain the security of
      our products, including to detect, investigate, prevent, stop, or
      remediate an attack on our computer systems or networks; or
protect the rights or property of
      ourselves, our affiliates, or others, including by enforcing our
      agreements, terms, and policies.
Parties to Corporate Transactions:
we may also share
     the personal information collected in connection
with your

as part of a
     corporate transaction or proceeding such as a merger, financing,
     acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or at transfer, divestiture, or sale
     of all or a portion of our business or assets.
Finally, we may share de-identified information in accordance
with applicable law.

Services
The Ford DiagNow app may
integrate with, or contain
links to, other products, services, features, websites, mobile apps, platforms,
or properties that Ford owns or operates and that display or refer to their own
privacy policies (“
Other Ford Services
”). Those privacy policies apply
to the Other Ford Services, but this Policy does not.
5.
Security
and Retention of Your Personal Information
Safeguarding personal information is important to us. While no systems,
applications, or websites are 100% secure, we take reasonable and appropriate
steps to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
To help us protect personal information, we request that you use
a strong password for your Ford service account and never share it with anyone
or use the same password with other mobile apps, websites, or accounts.
6.
California
Privacy Rights
This section describes the rights that the California Consumer
Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) gives to California residents under Cal. Civ. Code
§
1798.145(n).
Please be aware that Ford and Lincoln dealers and independent
repair facilities (“
IRF
”) are separate legal entities from Ford Motor Company and,
under the CCPA, separate businesses from Ford Motor Company. If you want to
exercise your CCPA rights regarding personal information a dealer or IRF may
have collected about you, you must contact the dealer or IRF directly and
exercise your rights through them.
Right to Opt Out of Sales.
This Privacy Policy describes above how we share personal
information with others in the context of your use of
the Ford
DiagNow app
. If you are a Ford or Lincoln vehicle owner, or if you use our
websites, mobile apps, or other products or services for your personal or
household use, our Ford US privacy policy at
https://www.ford.com/help/privacy/
describes
how we share personal information with others in those contexts.
Under the CCPA, some of this sharing is considered a
"sale" even if we do not receive money in exchange for the
information we share.
You have the right to instruct us to stop the kind of sharing
that the CCPA treats as "sales," and not to engage in that kind of
sharing in the future, unless you choose to allow it. Your instruction to stop
"selling" personal information about you will not affect “sales” that
occurred before you gave us the instruction.
Please be aware that there may be circumstances where we can
continue to share personal information about you with others, as permitted by
the CCPA. These circumstances may include carrying out previous directions
you've given us to disclose personal information about you to others or sharing
personal information about you with our service providers so that they can
provide services to us.
You can exercise your right to opt-out from future sales of
personal information in the following ways:
·
By clicking this link:
Do Not Sell My
Personal Information
and completing the webform; or
·
By calling us, toll-free, at 1-888-459-1291, Monday through
Friday from 5:00 am until 8:00 pm Pacific time or Saturday from 5:00 am until
5:00 pm Pacific time. Our call center will be closed on Sundays and on New
Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, the
day after Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day.
When you visit our websites, you can also limit our sharing with
social media, advertising, and analytics partners (some of which may constitute
CCPA "selling") by selecting your cookie preferences, which you can
access from the cookie banner on our websites or via the "Cookie
Settings" link at the bottom of the webpage.
Whether you use the web form or call us, we will need
information from you to process your CCPA sale opt-out request so that we can
confirm you are a California resident and determine if we have personal
information about you. We may also need to contact you about your request, and
you can choose the contact method you would like us to use.
Please be aware there might be circumstances where we will not
honor your sale opt-out request, as permitted under the CCPA. For example, if
we are not able to confirm that you are a California resident, we may not honor
your request.
You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an
authorized agent to make a sale opt-out request on your behalf under the CCPA.
Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to
provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf.
If you want an authorized agent to submit a “Do Not Sell My PI”
instruction on your behalf, the authorized agent must provide proof of your written
permission for the authorized agent to submit the instruction on your behalf.
Non-Discrimination.
You have the right not to be discriminated against for
exercising your right to opt out of CCPA “sales.”

Policy

Policy when necessary to reflect changes in our products, services, or

CATEGORIES AND SOURCES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
The personal information we collect depends on how you interact with us, the Products you use, and the choices you make. We collect personal information about you in different ways and from different sources, including through the Products we provide. Details about our privacy practices relating to Ford and Lincoln vehicles appear in the
Connected Vehicle Privacy
section below.
Information You Provide to Us
You provide information to us in various ways, including when you create or modify an account with us, use our Products, make a purchase from us, ask us for information about our Products, sign up for an event, enter a contest or sweepstakes, contact the Customer Relationship Center, or otherwise communicate with us. For example, we collect the following:
Contact Information
: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, we collect personal or business information such as name, email address, postal address, and phone number. We may also ask you to provide email addresses of others, for example if you use a “tell-a-friend” tool.
Demographics
: When you interact with us or our Products, you may also provide additional information such as your age range, nationality, and gender.
Payment Data
: If you make a purchase, we collect credit card numbers and other payment or billing information.
Preferences
: You may indicate preferences such as your preferred communication method, language, time zone, and dealer. When you use the vehicle shopping tools on our website, you indicate through your browsing and searches the kinds of vehicles, features, and options you may be interested in.
Audio/Visual
: In some cases, you can upload a photo for a profile image when creating an account, or you may provide your photo at an event or as part of a contest or sweepstakes.
Identifiers
: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, you may provide us with unique identifiers associated with you. For example, when you leave a comment on one of our social media sites, you provide us with your social media ID.
Security
: When you create or modify your Ford account, you provide us with an email/username and password, along with other information used to authenticate your account such as answers to security questions, etc. You can use these credentials to sign into other Ford experiences (if supported) including experiences offered by our affiliates, including Ford Credit, so you only need to remember one username and password when accessing our online and mobile Products.
Content of Communications
: When you communicate with us, such as via emails, customer service requests, survey responses, website chats or social media posts, likes, or messages, we collect the content of your communication.
Vehicle Service History
: We collect vehicle service history from you when you provide it to us on our sites.
When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline (such as not entering a credit card to use wallet services in the FordPass mobile app). But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary for certain Products, those Products may not function correctly or be available for use.
Where Ford makes chat features available, we utilize vendors, such as LivePerson. Our vendors that support chat features only use chat communications to support and improve the Ford chat experience.
Information From Your Vehicle
Ford and Lincoln vehicles have systems that record data about how the vehicle is performing, how it is driven, where it is located, and the environment where it is operated. This data may be associated with a vehicle's unique identification number (“VIN”) or other identifiers, and VIN or the other identifiers may be linked to you.
If your vehicle is equipped with Connected Services or has factory-installed connectivity technology capable of electronically transmitting vehicle-originated data to Ford, we may collect the following categories of information from your vehicle:
Vehicle Data
Driving Data
Vehicle Location (which may be collected through location-based features and functions in the vehicle or in our mobile apps and which may be derived from other information such as your mobile device’s location)
Audio/Visual
Media Analytics
Vehicle Analytics
Which categories of information are collected from your vehicle typically depends on how the vehicle is equipped for connectivity; in other words, what connectivity technologies, software version, data sharing settings, and Connected Services are present and what selections have been made for the data sharing settings. See the
Connected Vehicle Privacy
section below for details and data category definitions.
In limited situations, we may collect
Vehicle Location
, regardless of location settings. We do this to protect and defend our rights or property (including repossessing a vehicle in the event of a delinquency) or to comply with applicable law, to respond to valid legal process (including from law enforcement or other government agencies), or, in the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or help protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or apps, our visitors, or the public. For additional details about these situations, see the “
Our Disclosures of Personal Information
” section below.
Information From Your Devices
When you use our websites, mobile apps, online services, and other Products, we automatically collect some information from the devices you’re using (such as mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch, or computer). For example:
Device Details and Network Information
: Some devices reveal, and our servers log, information such as type of device, hardware model, MAC Address, operating system, version, settings, configuration, and network-related information (for example, IP address, mobile network provider, etc.). We may also collect device motion information if you enable that functionality in our mobile apps. As described more in the
Cookies
section below, our websites and online Products store and retrieve device identifiers (such as browser and other unique online identifiers) using cookies, pixel tags, and other digital technologies set on your device.

section below, when you browse our website or use our other online Products, we collect information about your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as access times, webpages or content viewed, mouse movements, scrolling, features used, how the webpage or online feature performed, the results of vehicles saved, built, searched for, or viewed during previous visits, other websites visited, etc.
Device and Mobile Location
: Depending on your device and app settings, we also collect location data from your devices. If your mobile device is connected to your vehicle via Bluetooth or tether, vehicle location may be derived from mobile device location.

Information We Generate About You
We generate information from the data we collect. For example:
Digital Activity

Inferred Preferences
: We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics. For example, we may use information about your vehicle and past purchases to determine your likely readiness to make a new purchase, which we may use for marketing, advertising, or other purposes. We may also infer information from your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as webpages visited, vehicles viewed, app features used, etc.
Identifiers
: When you interact with us, we may generate unique identifiers associated with you or your devices such as Ford account ID, customer ID, rewards program number, or browser or other online identifiers.

Dealers and Other Repairers:

For example, when you purchase a vehicle from a Ford or Lincoln dealer, the dealer provides Contact Information to Ford, including your name and address, as well as VIN and purchase information such as purchase date. When you service or repair your vehicle with a Ford or Lincoln dealer, we receive Contact Information and Vehicle Service History information (and certain other vehicle repair information), which includes history of repairs and may include information such as visit details, service details, repair history, applicable recall repairs, repair order details and payment, and warranty and extended service plan information.

Our websites, mobile apps, and other online Products use cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies to operate and to help collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.
Cookies on our websites are used to store your preferences and settings, help authenticate your Ford account and enable you to sign in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our Products perform, personalize your experience and the content you see on our website (such as by displaying vehicles you have previously viewed or searched for or by conveniently auto-filling data fields in online forms), and fulfill other legitimate purposes.
Our websites may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them, and in our ads appearing on other sites to measure the performance of those ads.
Our websites often include web beacons, cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies from third-party vendors. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics or advertising. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain third-party content (such as embedded videos, maps, plug-ins, or ads) that contain digital technologies used to track operability and performance of the content, as well as your interaction with the content to determine its effectiveness. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content and/or web beacons, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services that also contain that third party’s content or web beacons.
For example, our online Products use third-party tools (such as Mouseflow, Dynatrace, Amplitude, Adobe, and Google Analytics and other Google services), to support the operation and performance of our online Products and to analyze your interactions and experiences with our Products, including the features you engage with, how you navigate, and your click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity.

Interest-Based Advertising
As noted above, on some pages of our websites we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and other digital technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and other identifiers). We may also disclose such information we have collected to Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford Products, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) websites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or “online behavioral advertising”.
You can opt out of certain cookies and other technologies by clicking on the Cookie Settings link in the footer of our websites. You can also learn more by visiting our
Your Privacy Choices Page
and the additional information below.
Industry-wide opt-outs
. Many advertising and analytics providers are members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:
United States:
Network Advertising Initiative
and
Digital Advertising Alliance
Canada:
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
Europe:
European Digital Advertising Alliance
Mobile advertising ID controls
. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites. Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.
Browser controls
. Web browsers vary on whether they are set to accept or allow various types of cookies and similar digital technologies by default. You can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies and similar digital technologies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete digital technologies, settings and preferences controlled by those digital technologies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.
Do Not Track
. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.
Email web beacons
. You can disable web beacons in email messages by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.

OUR DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We disclose personal information with your consent, when you direct us to disclose it to others, as necessary to complete your transactions, or provide the Products you have requested or authorized. For example, when you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will disclose that data to banks and other entities as necessary for payment processing, fraud prevention, credit risk reduction, or other related financial services. We also disclose personal information to:
Affiliates
. We disclose personal information among the companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates. Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. We disclose information within this “family” as a normal part of business operations and offering products and services to our customers:
- For example, if you are financing your purchase or lease with Ford Credit and Ford Credit asks us to locate your vehicle due to default of your agreement with Ford Credit, we may disclose Vehicle Location with Ford Credit.
- If you create a Ford account, we disclose your account credentials within our family of companies so you only need to remember one username and password to access our online and mobile Products (if supported).
Dealers
. We disclose personal information to authorized Ford dealers, for example, to honor your request for a price quote on a vehicle, to alert the dealer when your vehicle is ready for service so they can contact you about scheduling a service visit, to assist in diagnosing service needs before and during a service visit, to inform dealers about recall or warranty information affecting your vehicle, to allow you to redeem rewards points from Ford loyalty programs at the dealership, to support our joint marketing activities, or to provide a dealer with information for purposes of contacting you in their regular course of business.
Vendors, Suppliers, and Agents
. We disclose personal information to vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Notice. In such cases we require them to use it only to perform that work for us and to use adequate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the personal information they receive. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal information to provide those functions.
Business Partners
. We disclose personal information to other companies that we work together with to offer services to our customers, or to reach potential customers with our marketing messages. Examples include:
-
SIRIUS XM.
We disclose personal information, including Contact Information, to Sirius XM so that Sirius XM can provide satellite radio trial subscription services in connection with vehicle purchases and leases, as well as information, customer support, and offers for Sirius XM satellite radio and other audio entertainment services.

Cookies
section of this Notice for a description of how we work with advertising and digital analytics providers.
- Social Media Platforms.
We disclose hashed emails from our marketing database or other information we have collected as described in this Notice to social media advertising platforms, such as Facebook, so that they can create Custom Audiences and deliver advertisements on our behalf to their users. Those users are identifiable to the Social Media company when it matches our hashed data to its hashed data of its users.
-
Joint Marketing Partners.
We disclose information to partners with which we offer co-branded service or engage in joint marketing activities.
- Vehicle Verification and Valuation Partners
. We disclose information about factory-installed vehicle features and options to third parties such as auction companies, insurance companies, dealers, lenders, guidebook providers, vehicle websites, and prospective buyers so that they can verify a vehicle’s features and options and estimate its value. The features and options information that we disclose to these third parties is linked to the unique VIN.
Law Enforcement Agencies, Courts, Regulatory Agencies, and Others.
We will disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is necessary to:
- Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;
- In the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or mobile apps, our visitors, or the public;

Be integrated with or offered through our Products;
Be made available to you through the vehicle infotainment system or in our mobile apps;
Be made available to you through the third party's app on your mobile device when you connect your mobile device to the vehicle via Bluetooth or tether; or

For example, some of our websites and online Products include mapping features provided by
Google
,
HERE
, and
Microsoft
(Bing Maps), which will collect and use personal information, including location information. If you use those mapping services, provide personal information to any of those third parties, or consent to our disclosure of personal information to them, the personal information they receive is governed by their privacy statements available via the above links. For example, if you use Bing Maps you agree to be bound by the Bing Terms of Use and Microsoft Privacy Policy.

Collection of Connected Vehicle Information
Whether your vehicle discloses Connected Vehicle Information to us typically depends on how the vehicle is equipped for connectivity – in other words, what connectivity technologies, software version, data sharing settings, and Connected Services are present and what selections have been made for data sharing settings. For information on other situations when we collect Connected Vehicle Information, see the
US Privacy Notice
section “Categories and Sources of Personal Information We Collect”.
When Connected Vehicle Information is transmitted from the vehicle, it is generally associated with a VIN or other unique identifiers, and the VIN or other unique identifiers can be linked to you. Connected Vehicle Information may also be transmitted from the vehicle in de-identified form, such that the information cannot reasonably be linked back to you. If de-identified information has been transmitted to us from the vehicle, we will use the information only in de-identified form and will not attempt to reidentify it.
Some vehicles for model year 2020 and later automatically transmit Vehicle Analytics and specific types of Vehicle Data (such as vehicle diagnostics) to us at delivery.
When you are asked to provide Connected Vehicle Information, you may decline (such as by not associating a VIN to a FordPass/Lincoln Way account). But, if you choose not to provide or allow Connected Vehicle Information, which is necessary for some Connected Services and other products, those Connected Services and other products may not function correctly or be available for use.
Your Disclosure of Connected Vehicle Information to Third Parties
You can disclose Connected Vehicle Information to third parties, or you can direct Ford to disclose Connected Vehicle Information to third parties, when you choose to use their applications or services that:
Are made available to you through the vehicle information and entertainment (“infotainment”) system;
Are made available to you through the third party’s app on your mobile device when you connect your mobile device to the vehicle via Bluetooth or tether; or
Require or permit the account you have with the third party to be linked to a Ford or Lincoln vehicle or mobile app.
If you choose to disclose Connected Vehicle Information with third parties, the third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policies (and not this Connected Vehicle Privacy Notice) apply to the information you disclose, or that you direct Ford to disclose, to them.

will not disable data sharing from the vehicle.
YOU SHOULD PERFORM A MASTER/FACTORY RESET:
BEFORE SELLING THE VEHICLE OR TRANSFERRING VEHICLE OWNERSHIP
AFTER PURCHASING OR LEASING A PRE-OWNED VEHICLE
BEFORE AND AFTER RENTING A VEHICLE FROM A RENTAL COMPANY
ANY TIME YOU WANT TO DISCONNECT A MODEM-EQUIPPED VEHICLE FROM ALL FORDPASS/LINCOLN WAY ACCOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VEHICLE (WHETHER THE ACCOUNT IS YOURS OR SOMEONE ELSE’S).
Connected Vehicle Services and Technologies
We work with AT&T as our current cellular network provider for our Connected Services in the United States. Not all features or services will be available in all markets and coverage may be limited, including due to your vehicle capability and data plan coverage. Availability of features is subject to change and dependent on mobile device and vehicle capability and the internet access available to you. Some features may only be available through certain services. Vehicle connectivity and Connected Services, including over-the-air Software updates, may be unavailable or interrupted from time to time for a variety of reasons, such as environmental or topographical conditions or data plan coverage.
Our Connected Services include:
FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) / Lincoln Connect (if equipped)
: FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect enables access to features through a modem built into the vehicle. The modem allows the vehicle to connect to wireless networks, much like a mobile device with a subscriber identity module (SIM). Like other vehicle parts, the modem is installed at the factory. Periodically, the modem sends messages to us, through our cellular network provider to enable Connected Services. The messages could include information that identifies the vehicle, the SIM, and the electronic serial number (ESN) of the FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) / Lincoln Connect modem. The cellular network provider may also associate the modem’s SIM to additional information such as cellular network tower identification. Unless the modem is deactivated or vehicle connectivity is disabled, the modem will communicate with the cellular network provider. You may be able to customize your preferences in the in-vehicle Settings menu. Please refer to the owner’s manual or contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center for more information. When connected with the FordPass app or the Lincoln Way app, you may be able to access additional features.
Ford Connectivity Devices Other Than Modems (if equipped)
: Connectivity devices (either installed in the vehicle at the factory, installed in the vehicle by a dealer, or plugged into the OBD port in compatible vehicles) enable access to Connectivity Services. Connectivity devices allow connected vehicles to connect to a wireless network (much like a mobile device with a SIM). Periodically, the connectivity device sends messages to us, through our cellular network provider. These messages contain a unique number which identifies the connectivity device’s SIM, the vehicle's VIN, and the electronic serial number (ESN) of the connectivity device. The cellular network provider may also associate the connectivity device’s SIM to additional information such as cellular network tower identification. Unless the connectivity device is deactivated, the connectivity device will communicate with the cellular network provider. Please refer to the owner’s manual or contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center for more information. When connected with the FordPass app (Lincoln Way app) and associated to the vehicle, you may be able to access additional features. Some features require an active Ford / Lincoln Account.
Wi-Fi Hotspot (if equipped)
: Certain vehicles equipped with FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect can sign-up with AT&T for Wi-Fi Hotspot service in the vehicle. To enable the activation of the Wi-Fi Hotspot, certain information, including the vehicle's VIN and the SIM identifier, is provided to AT&T, who manages the subscription and will use that information according to its own privacy notice, which you can find
here
. AT&T will inform us when certain data usage thresholds are met. If you have paired FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect to the FordPass or Lincoln Way app, you can view approximate data plan usage amounts within the app and in your vehicle. For more information about the vehicle Wi-Fi hotspot, please visit the following websites:
-
Ford Vehicles
-
Lincoln Vehicles
Note:
If you’re planning to sell your Ford or Lincoln connected vehicle, remember to remove the vehicle from your AT&T account before you sell the vehicle. And, if you purchase or lease a used Ford or Lincoln connected vehicle, you’ll need to contact AT&T to add the new vehicle to your AT&T account.
Wi-Fi (if equipped)
: To enhance the SYNC experience, when connected to Wi-Fi (data charges may apply), Vehicle Analytics is shared with us and we periodically release software updates (cellular connectivity may also be used). You may also be able to choose to enable Share Media Analytics, Send Failed Voice Commands, and/or Submit Feedback regarding SYNC in the in-vehicle settings menu.
Note:
Please make sure you connect the vehicle to trusted Wi-Fi networks.
Mobile Apps (if equipped):
You may be able to use Mobile Apps with SYNC using AppLink, USB, or Bluetooth to connect compatible mobile apps on your device with SYNC 3/SYNC 4 (SYNC). Your mobile device provides the data connection (so data charges for your mobile device may apply) and SYNC provides the infotainment integration, including voice controls. Mobile Apps with SYNC will use the connected device’s data plan to send encrypted data including your VIN, SYNC module serial number, odometer, enabled apps, usage statistics and debugging information to Ford which may be used for service functionality, troubleshooting, continuous improvement, and for the other purposes set out in this Policy.
In certain Ford Digital Experience and Lincoln Digital Experience vehicles, where available, you can use embedded or download compatible apps directly to the infotainment system. To download apps through the Google Play Store, you will need to log into your Google Account using the vehicle infotainment touchscreen.
The vehicle will send us information regarding what apps are enabled, usage statistics and debugging information for service functionality, continuous improvement, and for the other purposes set out in this Policy.
Use of mobile apps requires user consent to send and receive app authorization information and updates. When launching an app for the first time, it may ask you for permission to access certain information or functionality. The infotainment system organizes app permissions into groups. You may be able to grant these group permissions individually, change a permission status any time when not driving in the in-vehicle Settings menu, and see the data included in each group, if equipped. Permissions may include, for example, exchanging with a third-party app information about the vehicle, such as Vehicle Data, Driving Data, Vehicle Location, Convenience Controls, and/or Push Notifications. See your in-vehicle Settings menu or Owner’s Manual for more information. Please be aware that the permission selections available to you may vary based on the infotainment system version equipped in your vehicle. Please note that you are only prompted to grant permissions the first time you use an app with the infotainment system and your device or with an active profile. The permissions you select will be specific to the profile in use at the time or the connected device. We recommend you review the terms and conditions and privacy notices for any third-party app or service to which you subscribe and/or use. We take no responsibility for apps or services provided by any third party, including their use of any data. If you choose to share information about your vehicle through your use of third-party apps or services, once you have shared the information, the third party’s terms and conditions and privacy notices (and not this Notice) apply to the shared information.
- If you change your mind about sharing vehicle information with a mobile app or want to stop using it with SYNC, you can change your preferences in SYNC’s settings in the vehicle.
911 Assist (if equipped):
911 Assist (if equipped and active) may, through any paired and connected cellular phone, disclose to emergency services that the vehicle has been in a crash involving the deployment of an airbag or, in certain vehicles, the activation of the fuel pump shut-off. Certain versions or updates to 911 Assist may also be capable of being used to electronically or verbally provide the vehicle location (such as latitude and longitude) and/or other details about the vehicle or crash, change in velocity, and possible detection of fastened seatbelts, or personal information about the occupants to 911 operators to assist them in providing the most appropriate emergency services. If you do not want to disclose this information, do not activate the 911 Assist feature. If any user sets 911 Assist to on or off, that setting applies for all paired phones. To switch 911 Assist on and off or for more information, please see your owner’s manual (SYNC and Settings).
Note:
Vehicles equipped with the MyKey feature may be capable of overriding the 911 Assist settings and turning 911 Assist On, even if it was previously set to Off. If you do not want to disclose this information, do not enable MyKey.
Location and Global Positioning System (GPS) (if equipped):
Some vehicles contain global positioning system (GPS) capability or, in some instances, may utilize the GPS in connected mobile devices. GPS may be used to determine the vehicle’s precise physical location, travel direction, and speed, and to record this information over time to provide location-based services.
Ford Apps:
If a vehicle is equipped with connectivity technology, you may be able to connect to the vehicle using the FordPass/Lincoln Way apps. If you associate a vehicle to your FordPass/Lincoln Way account, the vehicle may send Connected Vehicle Information, including location information, to us. To turn off sharing data associated with your FordPass/Lincoln Way Account, you must perform a
MASTER/FACTORY RESET
on the vehicle or remove the VIN from your FordPass / Lincoln Way app garage. Removing the vehicle from the Account’s garage must be done for all associated accounts in order to remove the remote access, and to stop access and transmission of the related Connected Vehicle Information. Deleting the app from your device will not disable data sharing. For more information, please see the app privacy notice:
-
Ford Pass
-
Lincoln Way
Multimedia Infotainment Systems (for example SYNC®):
Vehicles equipped with an “infotainment” system, for example SYNC, allow you to connect a mobile device to your vehicle, display data from your device on the touchscreen for example, music and album art, use the device’s cellular data connection to transmit vehicle data or make phone calls, or use embedded or downloaded apps.
If equipped, you may be able to connect the vehicle to a Wi-Fi access point outside of the vehicle using the infotainment touchscreen. Please use trusted networks. Data charges may apply.
If you no longer plan to use the infotainment system or the vehicle, we recommend you perform a MASTER/FACTORY RESET or Connectivity Reset to erase the stored information. You can find more information about the available reset options in your in-vehicle Settings menu or in the Owner’s Manual.
Over-the-Air Updates:
If your vehicle is equipped with a connected functionality, we may be able to remotely update the Infotainment System, embedded modem, connectivity device software, or the vehicle’s operating system (“
Software
”) via an over-the-air (“
OTA
”) update. Data usage rates and fees may apply.
Please be aware that we (or our affiliates or service providers) may remotely check and automatically update the Software and your use of the Software is in accordance with the vehicle software End User License Agreement (“EULA”) provided in your vehicle Owner Manual.  You may be able to disable Software updates in your in-vehicle Settings menu. After disabling Software updates, you may receive an in-vehicle notification informing you an update is available. See the Owner’s Manual for details. If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact us (see “How to Contact Us” section for details).
Please also be aware that Ford, its affiliates, service providers, and/or designated agents may periodically remotely check the version of the Software and may, as permitted by law, automatically remotely deliver Software updates, upgrades, supplements, or changes to the Software without any further notice or additional consent. For example, these updates or changes may enhance safety or security, provide improved functionality, or may maintain the proper operation of the vehicle. Certain functionality may be limited or interrupted during the delivery of these Software updates or changes. These Software updates or changes may affect or erase data that you have stored in the vehicle. We are not responsible for any affected or erased data due to a Software update or change.
Because the vehicle will store preferences and any imported data, such as an address book, don't forget to do a Reset if you ever sell your car or buy a used vehicle equipped with the Modem.
The owner's manual explains available options and how to do this.
Data Sharing Icons - How to Know if a Vehicle is Sharing Data
Select model year vehicles include in-vehicle icons that indicate when Connected Vehicle Information is being shared. These icons may be hidden temporarily while you navigate in menus or use certain features and services (such as Android Auto™ or Apple CarPlay®).
If a FordPass / Lincoln Way account has not been associated with the vehicle, the above icon indicates that only Vehicle Data is being shared. If a FordPass / Lincoln Way account has been associated with the vehicle, the above icon indicates that Vehicle Data and/or Driving Data is being shared.
Beginning in Model Year 2024, certain equipped vehicles have the above Wi-Fi and cellular signal strength icon which indicates the reception strength of the connected network and also indicates the potential transmission of Vehicle Data.
If a FordPass / Lincoln Way account has been associated with the vehicle, the above icon indicates that Vehicle Data and/or Driving Data, plus Vehicle Location are being shared.
If a FordPass / Lincoln Way account has been associated with the vehicle, the above icon indicates Vehicle Location is being shared.

Sharing a Vehicle or Driving a Shared Vehicle
If you share your vehicle with others, let them know about your vehicle's connectivity and privacy settings. For example, inform passengers and other drivers of the vehicle that Connected Vehicle Information is being collected and used by us and others as described above in the section “Our Disclosure of Connected Vehicle Information”. In addition, tell other drivers how they can make changes using the in-vehicle Settings menu.
You are responsible for ensuring that anyone sharing your vehicle has read and understood this Connected Vehicle Privacy Notice and, if required by law, has consented to our collection, use and/or disclosure of personal data when driving your vehicle.
In certain vehicles, drivers and passengers with an unrecognized mobile device may see a pop-up window in the vehicle that alerts them to current data sharing settings. A mobile device is "recognized" if it has been paired using Bluetooth with SYNC. This way, if someone is new to your vehicle, or has not paired their mobile device, the vehicle will notify the person that data is being transmitted.
In Ford Digital Experience and Lincoln Digital Experience vehicles where users can select a driver profile, drivers and passengers may see a pop-up window in the vehicle that alerts them one of the settings that controls transmission of Connected Vehicle Information to Ford had changed since the last time the profile was selected. Another driver may change your sharing settings, so don't forget that when you reposition your seat or adjust your mirrors, you may also need to re-adjust your data sharing settings.
