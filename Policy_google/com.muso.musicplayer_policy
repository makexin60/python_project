WHAT INFORMATION DOES MUSO PLAYER COLLECT?
The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories:
1) data on how the user uses our Services;
2) aggregate data on the content with which the user engages.
We collect information to provide better Services to youâ€”from figuring out
      basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like
      which ads you'll find most useful.The information we collect, and how that
      information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you
      manage your privacy controls.
You understand and consent that we may provide and share the
        information to our partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an
        optimal experience, but we never disclose information to a partner in a
        manner that would identify you personally.
We use the unique identifiers tied to the application or device you are
      using to collect information.
For greater certainty, whenever you interact with our website or apps, we
      automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your
      browser including your IP address, "cookie" information, and the page you
      requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your mobile device
      that allow us to recognize your device and tell us how and when the
      Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the
      preferences on your device to prevent or limit your acceptance of cookies,
      but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
Whenever you interact with MUSO PLAYER, we automatically receive and
      record information on our server logs. The information we collect
      includes:
1. Services usage data.
For example, this may include
      your age and gender, language you use, terms you search for, videos you
      watch, views and interactions with content and ads, voice and audio
      information when you use audio features, purchase activity, people with
      whom you communicate or share content, information regarding the version
      of our software you are using, the location from where you downloaded our
      software, how often you launch our software and which features you use.
2. Data about your account.
If you login to our Services
      via third Platform account like Google, we will ask for your permission to
      access certain information about that other account. The information we
      receive depends on what information you (via your privacy settings) or the
      third Platform decide to give us.
3. User-generated contents ("UGC")
, such as lyric, music
      or other data or materials that you upload, distribute or stream on the
      App when you use MUSO PLAYER Services;
4. Data on the quality of our Services.
For example, this
      may include the interaction of your devices with our services, including
      IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
      referrer URL of your request and your connection between your phone and
      your computer.
5. Aggregate statistics on content.
For example, this may
      include the number of contacts you have on your phone, how many contacts
      you have marked as favorites, and the number of apps, songs, videos, or
      other content you have on your phone. This information is only collected
      as aggregate data, without reference to you or your contacts' identities.
6. Hardware and software identification.
For example,
      this may include the device type, settings and image resolution, operating
      system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone
      number, the version of Android operating system, the size of your device's
      screen and internal storage. We support over 500 different Android devices
      and this helps us reach decisions as to how to prioritize support for
      different kinds of hardware and software.
7. Location information.
We may collect information about
      your location when you use our Services. Your location can be determined
      by GPS, IP address, sensor data from your device, information about things
      near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and
      Bluetooth-enabled devices.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from
        children under the applicable age in your country or knowingly allow
        such persons to register unless it is upon the specific and highlighted
        consent of at least one of the parents or the legal representatives of
        the child. If you are a child as defined by any applicable law, please
        do not attempt to send any information about yourself to us without the
        permission of your parents or legal representatives, including your
        name, address, telephone number, or email address. No child may provide
        any personal information to us without necessary permission from its
        parents or legal representatives. We will use commercially reasonable
        efforts to verify that the consent referred to above was given by the
        child's representatives, considering available technologies. When we
        learn that we have collected personal information from a child without
        verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as
        quickly as possible. Children's personal data may be collected without
        the consent mentioned above when collection is necessary to contact the
        parents or the legal representatives, used one single time and not
        stored, or for their protection, and under no circumstances shall the
        data be passed on to third parties without consents as provided herein.
        If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child,
        please contact us at
support@musoplayer.com
.
Our Services will not collect the following information without your
      specific consent or satisfying the preconditions required by applicable
      laws:
Your or your friends' phone numbers
Any of the content of your text messages, either sent or received
Your music, photos, video, or any contents you download via our Services
Your sensitive personal data concerning racial or ethnic origin,
        religious belief
political opinion, trade union or religious, philosophical or political
        organization membership, data concerning health or sex life, genetic or
        biometric data, when related to a natural person
We will generally retain information for as long as required, allowed or
      for as long as we believe it useful. Even if the processing of personal
      data is terminated, we may continue to use and disclose your Personal
      Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as amended from time to
      time to the extent allowed by applicable laws for purposes of a)
      compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation by the controller; b)
      transfer to third parties; or c) exclusive use of the controller, with
      access by third parties being prohibited, and provided the data has been
      anonymized.
We do not purport to have listed all possible disclosures that we might
      make. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand our general
      practices. This policy is not a promise that your information will never
      be disclosed except as described above. For example, third parties may
      unlawfully intercept or access information transmitted to or contained on
      the site, technologies may malfunction or not work as anticipated, or
      someone might access, abuse or misuse information, despite a lack of
      permission. Although we use what we believe to be commercially reasonable
      practices to protect your privacy, that does not mean, and you should not
      expect it to mean, that your information or communications will always be
      private or protected.
