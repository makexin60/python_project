Please note that there are exceptions to the rights below, so access may be denied, for example where we are legally prevented from making a disclosure.
Your rights in connection to your personal data
Right to be informed
You have the right to be informed about how we process personal data about you. We do this in this Privacy Policy. You may however always contact us if you have any further questions.
Right of access
You have the right to access the personal data that we hold about you. In this respect, you may receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. For any further copies, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee based on our administrative costs. To exercise this right, please contact us as set out below. Please note that much of the personal data that we process about you is available and visible for you in your Zettle Account.
This right means that you have a right to:
receive a confirmation about what personal data that we process about you
get access to your personal data, and
receive such supplementary information (which corresponds to the information
that is provided in this Privacy Policy).
Please note that we might have to ask you to provide further information about yourself in order for us to be able to identify you and handle the request in an efficient and secure way. This may mean that we may require you to send in a copy of a valid ID, which we will also require you to sign.
Right to rectification
We ensure that inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data is erased or rectified. You have the right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you.
Right to erasure of your personal data (”Right to be forgotten”)
You have the right to erasure if:
the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected or processed for (and no new lawful purpose exists)
your particular situation gives you the right to object to processing on grounds of legitimate interest (see more below) and there is no justified reason for continuing the processing;
the lawful basis for the processing is your consent, and you withdraw your consent, and no other lawful grounds exist,
processing the personal data has been unlawful, or
there is a legal obligation for us to erase the data.
Please note that due the fact that we provide such financial services which are subject to a license, we are in many cases obliged to retain personal data on you during your customer relationship, and even after that, e.g. to comply with a statutory obligation or where processing is carried out to manage legal claims. This means that we will keep any KYC data that we have about you during such time period as we are required according to applicable anti-money laundering regulations.
Right to restrict the processing of your personal data
You have the right to request us to restrict the processing of your data (meaning that the personal data may only be held by us and may only be used for limited purposes) if:
the personal data we have about you is inaccurate,
the processing is unlawful and you ask us to restrict the use of the personal data instead of erasing it,
we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but if we still need it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or
you have objected to the processing claiming that the legal basis of legitimate interest is invalid and are waiting for the verification of this claim.
Right to object to the processing of your personal data
Where our lawful basis for processing your data is our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your data if:
you can show that your interests, rights and freedoms regarding the personal data outweigh our interest to process your personal data, or
we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including but not limited to profiling.
This means that we will cease such processing unless we
demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or
require the personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend legal rights.
If you choose to object to our further processing of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy, please note that we may no longer be able to provide you with the services you have requested and may therefore terminate relevant agreements with you, see relevant terms and conditions for more information. In addition, we may continue to process your personal data for other legitimate purposes, such as to fulfil an agreement with you, to protect our interests in connection with legal proceedings and to fulfil our legal obligations.
Choices related to communication and marketing
If you have received marketing from us, you may at any time object to the marketing. The easiest way to do so is to opt out by following the instructions in the marketing material that you have received.
If you have a PayPal merchant account or an account as a consumer using PayPal as a payment method, meaning such other services than the Zettle services, you may also adjust your communication preferences in your account settings and for messages sent via push notifications, you may manage your preferences in your device.
Please note that we may continue sending you communication that is required or necessary to users of our services, including provide such notifications that include important information and other communication that you request from us. You may not opt out of receiving these communications.
Right to data portability
You have the right to data portability:
for personal data that you provided to us, and
if the legal basis for the processing of the personal data is the fulfilment of contract or consent.
We will send a copy of your data in a commonly used and machine-readable format to you or a person/organization appointed by you, where technically feasible and where the exercise by you of this right does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

What Personal Data do we collect from third parties?
We process personal data obtained from selected third parties such as credit bureaus, fraud detection agencies, other financial institutions and other information providers, and from publicly available sources (such as population registers and registers held by tax authorities, company registration offices, enforcement authorities etc). Third parties from which we obtain personal data can also be e.g. social networks or similar that you have linked your Zettle account with. In connection with payments we collect information from e.g. banks, payment service providers and others.
Other external resources from which we may collect information are sanctions lists (held by international organisations such as the EU and UN as well as national organisations such as Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), the UK HM Treasury sanctions list, warnings issued by the warnings issued by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier on the following website (or any similar website of the CSSF):
https://www.cssf.lu/en/publication-data/?content_type=617
, registers held by credit-rating agencies and other commercial information providers providing information on e.g. beneficial owners and politically exposed persons.
How will we
not
use your personal data?
We will never use your personal data for any other purposes than those listed in this Privacy Policy, unless we collect your written consent or inform you prior to initiating any processing for new purposes or a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which we collected the personal data, all in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
What we will not do with your personal data:
We
will not
share personal data with third parties for them to use for their own marketing purposes without ensuring that there is a lawful ground to do so.
We
will not
sell your personal data to third parties.
What about automated decision making and profiling?
Automated decision making is the process of making a decision by automated means without any human involvement. Profiling means analysis of an individual's personality, behaviour, interest and habits to make predictions or decisions about them. There are such solely automated decisions, that
could have a legal or similarly significant
effect on you as an individual. We may in some cases use automated decision-making for decisions, if authorised under Union or Member state law or where necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract.
You can always ask for a manual decision-making process instead, express your opinion or contest decision making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, if such a decision would produce
legal effects or otherwise similarly significantly affect you
.
Please contact us if you require more information on automated-decision making.

Third parties that are data processors
. Some of the third parties that we share personal data with are data processors. A data processor is such a party that processes personal data on our instructions and on our behalf.
We collaborate with selected suppliers, which include processing of personal data on behalf of us. Examples include suppliers of IT development, maintenance, hosting and support and suppliers supporting us with marketing.
We only share personal data with data processors for purposes compatible with the purposes for which we have collected the data (such as performance of a contract). We always control all data processors and ensure that they can provide adequate guarantees as regards security and confidentiality of personal data. We have written agreements in place with all data processors through which they guarantee the security, protection and confidentiality of personal data that they process on our behalf.
Third parties that are data controllers
. Some of the third parties that we share personal data with are independent data controllers. This means that we are not the ones that dictate how the data that we provide shall be processed. Examples include government authorities, credit bureaus, acquirers, merchants and other financial institutions. When your data is shared with independent data controllers their data policies and personal data processing principles apply.
Authorities
. We also disclose personal data to authorities to the extent we are under a statutory obligation to do so. Such authorities include tax authorities, police authorities, enforcement authorities and supervisory authorities in relevant countries. We may also be required to provide competent authorities information about your use of our services, e.g. revenue or tax authorities, as required by law, which may include personal data such as your name, address and information regarding card transactions processed by us on your behalf through your use of our services.
What about transfers to a third country?
If we transfer your personal data to a third country, i.e. a country outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the UK we will comply with all applicable laws in respect of such transfer, including making sure that your personal data is kept secure, and ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure there is adequate protection, such as entering into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.
Our preferred basis for transfer is the use of Standard Contractual Clauses.
We transfer your data to service providers in the US and we base such transfer on Standard Contractual Clauses.
We also transfer your data to service providers in Australia and we base such processing on Standard Contractual Clauses.
For transfers of your Personal Data within PayPal Group, we rely on Binding Corporate Rules approved by competent supervisory authorities (available
here
).
Security - how do we protect your personal data?
We take security seriously.
We always process personal data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures to prevent that your personal data is used for non-legitimate purposes or disclosed to unauthorized third parties and otherwise protected from misuse, loss, alteration or destruction.
The technical and organizational measures that we have implemented are designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks that are associated with our data processing activities, in particular accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to your personal data including access control to premises, facilities, systems and data, disclosure control, input control, job control, availability control and segregation control.

Can children use our services?
The sites and Zettle services are not directed to children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information, including Personal Data, from children or other individuals who are not legally able to use our sites and Zettle services. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Data from a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data. Contact us if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from a child under the age of 16.
How long do we store your personal data?
We will not process your personal data for a longer period than is necessary to fulfill the purpose of such processing, as set out in this Privacy Policy. We only retain your personal data to ensure compliance with our legal and regulatory requirements. Your personal data will be anonymized or deleted once it is no longer relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.
This means that we as an example will only keep your data for as long as necessary for the performance of a contract and as required by applicable laws. If we keep your data for other purposes than those of the performance of a contract, such as anti-money laundering purposes, bookkeeping and regulatory capital adequacy requirements, we keep the data only if necessary and/or mandated by laws and regulations for the respective purpose.
The data retention obligations will differ within the PayPal Group subject to applicable local laws.
See below for examples of the retention periods that we apply:
Preventing, detecting and investigating money laundering, terrorist financing and fraud: minimum five (5) years after termination of the business connection
Bookkeeping regulations: seven (7) years
Details on performance of an agreement: up to ten (10) years after end of customer relationship to defend against possible claims
Recorded telephone calls to our support: up to ninety (90) days from telephone call to support, but may keep the recordings for up to two (2) years fraud investigation purposes.
The above is only for explanatory purposes and the retention times may differ from country to country.
What say do you have in how we process your data (aka. your rights)?
We might be the ones in the driver's seat on the processing of your personal data when you use our websites or services. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t do anything about it.
You have rights and they are important to us!
Generally, we believe you have the right to have your data processed only in accordance with your expectations. But you also have rights laid down by applicable law. Below you can read more about your rights, in the order we believe might be most relevant for you.
The rights we believe are most relevant for you
You have the
right to be informed
about certain details on the processing of your personal data. We provide this information through this Privacy Policy.
You have the
right to receive a copy
of the personal data we process about you. You can receive this data by reaching out to us.
You have the
right to correct
the personal data we process about you if you see that it is inaccurate.
You have the
right to object
to our processing of your personal data.
Please note that there are exceptions to the rights below, so access may be denied, for example where we are legally prevented from making a disclosure.
Your rights in connection to your personal data
Right to be informed
You have the right to be informed about how we process personal data about you. We do this in this Privacy Policy. You may however always contact us if you have any further questions.
Right of access
You have the right to access the personal data that we hold about you. In this respect, you may receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. For any further copies, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee based on our administrative costs. To exercise this right, please contact us as set out below. Please note that much of the personal data that we process about you is available and visible for you in your Zettle Account.
This right means that you have a right to:
receive a confirmation about what personal data that we process about you
get access to your personal data, and
receive such supplementary information (which corresponds to the information
that is provided in this Privacy Policy).
Please note that we might have to ask you to provide further information about yourself in order for us to be able to identify you and handle the request in an efficient and secure way. This may mean that we may require you to send in a copy of a valid ID, which we will also require you to sign.
Right to rectification
We ensure that inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data is erased or rectified. You have the right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you.
Right to erasure of your personal data (”Right to be forgotten”)
You have the right to erasure if:
the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected or processed for (and no new lawful purpose exists)
your particular situation gives you the right to object to processing on grounds of legitimate interest (see more below) and there is no justified reason for continuing the processing;
the lawful basis for the processing is your consent, and you withdraw your consent, and no other lawful grounds exist,
processing the personal data has been unlawful, or
there is a legal obligation for us to erase the data.
Please note that due the fact that we provide such financial services which are subject to a license, we are in many cases obliged to retain personal data on you during your customer relationship, and even after that, e.g. to comply with a statutory obligation or where processing is carried out to manage legal claims. This means that we will keep any KYC data that we have about you during such time period as we are required according to applicable anti-money laundering regulations.
Right to restrict the processing of your personal data
You have the right to request us to restrict the processing of your data (meaning that the personal data may only be held by us and may only be used for limited purposes) if:
the personal data we have about you is inaccurate,
the processing is unlawful and you ask us to restrict the use of the personal data instead of erasing it,
we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but if we still need it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or
you have objected to the processing claiming that the legal basis of legitimate interest is invalid and are waiting for the verification of this claim.
Right to object to the processing of your personal data
Where our lawful basis for processing your data is our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your data if:
you can show that your interests, rights and freedoms regarding the personal data outweigh our interest to process your personal data, or
we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including but not limited to profiling.
This means that we will cease such processing unless we
demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or
require the personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend legal rights.
If you choose to object to our further processing of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy, please note that we may no longer be able to provide you with the services you have requested and may therefore terminate relevant agreements with you, see relevant terms and conditions for more information. In addition, we may continue to process your personal data for other legitimate purposes, such as to fulfil an agreement with you, to protect our interests in connection with legal proceedings and to fulfil our legal obligations.
Choices related to communication and marketing
If you have received marketing from us, you may at any time object to the marketing. The easiest way to do so is to opt out by following the instructions in the marketing material that you have received.
If you have a PayPal merchant account or an account as a consumer using PayPal as a payment method, meaning such other services than the Zettle services, you may also adjust your communication preferences in your account settings and for messages sent via push notifications, you may manage your preferences in your device.
Please note that we may continue sending you communication that is required or necessary to users of our services, including provide such notifications that include important information and other communication that you request from us. You may not opt out of receiving these communications.
Right to data portability
You have the right to data portability:
for personal data that you provided to us, and
if the legal basis for the processing of the personal data is the fulfilment of contract or consent.
We will send a copy of your data in a commonly used and machine-readable format to you or a person/organization appointed by you, where technically feasible and where the exercise by you of this right does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
