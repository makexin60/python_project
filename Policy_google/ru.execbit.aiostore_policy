Privacy Policy
Evgeny Zobnin ("we," "our," or "us") built the AIO Launcher app as a Freemium app. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is. This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our application and the choices you have associated with that data.
Information We Collect
We collect and process a limited amount of information to improve the user experience. The data we collect is categorized as follows:
Personal Information
This may include:
User name
Email address
OAuth2 credentials used to access Gmail service (for mail management features)
Non-Personal Data
Device information (e.g., IP address, device model, OS version)
Usage data (e.g., app performance, feature usage)
Diagnostic information (e.g., crash reports, error logs)
Third-Party Services
The app integrates with third-party services, which may collect data to identify you. We advise you to consult their privacy policies:
Google Play Services
Google Analytics for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Purpose of Data Collection
We collect and use your data for the following purposes:
To provide core app functionality (e.g., email management)
To improve the user experience through usage analytics
To maintain the app and fix technical issues (through crash reports and diagnostics)
We do not sell, share, or otherwise disclose your personal data to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.
Data Storage and Retention
Personal Data
All personal information processed by the app is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or store this information on our servers.
Log Data
In the event of an error or crash, diagnostic information (including IP address, device model, OS version, and usage statistics) is collected by third-party services like Firebase Crashlytics for error tracking purposes. This data is retained as part of error logs and cannot be deleted.
Third-Party Data Retention
Third-party services such as Google Analytics and Firebase may retain collected data for their own purposes as outlined in their privacy policies. This data typically includes usage patterns, device information, and crash logs.
Cloud Storage and Personal Data Synchronization
The app supports synchronization of personal data through cloud storage services (e.g., Dropbox).
However, this functionality is entirely under user control.
You must connect your own cloud drive, and any data stored on the cloud is managed solely by you.
Data Deletion Policy
As we do not store any personal data on our servers, there is no need to request data deletion for personal data. All personal data is stored on your device or cloud storage connected by you.
Logs and analytics data
collected by third-party services, such as Google Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics, are stored on their servers and cannot be deleted by us. Please refer to their privacy policies for more information on data retention and management.
Security
We value the security of your data and take commercially reasonable measures to protect your personal information. However, please note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
User Control
You have control over the information the app accesses:
You can revoke OAuth2 permissions at any time through Google’s security settings.
You can manage app permissions (such as access to device storage, email, and internet) via your device's settings.
Children's Privacy
Our services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. In the event we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete such information from our systems.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are encouraged to periodically review this policy for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately upon posting.
International Transfers
Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers located outside of your country, where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. By using the app, you consent to such transfers.
