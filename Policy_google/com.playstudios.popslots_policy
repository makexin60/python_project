Information We Collect
Information We Collect Directly From You
We and our Service Providers collect certain information directly from you in a variety of contexts, such as when you register, make purchases or redeem Loyalty Points, Virtual Items, and Rewards, communicate with us, and post any User Content.
Certain areas and features of the Applications require registration, such as to accumulate, purchase and redeem Loyalty Points, Virtual Items and Rewards, and to post any User Content. To register, you must create an account with PLAYSTUDIOS, which can be done by logging into our Applications through your Facebook or Apple account (or other Third-Party Services that we may integrate with from time-to-time). If you choose to purchase a Reward with your Loyalty Points, we may collect your name, email address, and other information in order to process your Reward.
Transacting with Us
If you choose to purchase a Reward with your Loyalty Points, we may collect your name, email address, geographic location, and other information in order to process your Reward.
Communicating with Us
We collect your information if you communicate with us, such as when you submit support requests or become a hosted or VIP player.
If you submit a request to us through the Support tab in the game, or via Facebook, that request is sent to us via email through our third-party customer service provider. When we receive your request, we save the email and the correspondence between you and us. We might request that you provide us with information about your gameplay or the issue you are contacting us about in order to better provide you with a response or a solution to an issue you are experiencing. We store those emails and other related information on our system and a copy is retained by our third-party customer service provider.
If you become a hosted player, or VIP player, we might engage with you directly via in-app communications, email, and sometimes, with your consent, via phone. Based on our communications with you we will gather and store personal information about you that you provide to us.
Information We Collect About You From Third Parties (Facebook, Apple).
One of the main ways in which we collect information from third parties is when you sign in with a Third-Party Service like Facebook or Apple.
When you log into our mobile application through your Facebook account, you will be asked to enter your Facebook email address and password. Facebook controls the information collected from you during the log-in process; PLAYSTUDIOS does not control the information that Facebook collects from you. When you use any of our Applications through Facebook or on a mobile Application that you have connected to Facebook, we will have access to, and may collect and store, the following information: your public profile, profile picture, gaming profile (your player name and avatar), gender, list of friends who play the same apps that you play, date of birth, email address, and IP address. We may use this information to (i) send you email; (ii) facilitate your log in for apps; (iii) render pronouns and personal your experience based on gender; (iv) display your first name or player name and your player avatar in-game.  If you make a purchase in our Facebook game, we will also collect your IP address and country, and you submit a dispute through Facebook, your dispute email address and any comment you submit.
For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the Facebook Privacy Policy. We store the information that we receive from Facebook along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.
When you use Sign in with Apple you will be asked to enter your Apple ID and the email address you use with your Apple ID.  When you first sign in using Sign in with Apple, you can elect to hide your email address.

Information We Collect From your Device.
We collect the following information from your mobile device: IP Address, Device AdId, Device Model, Device Name, Operating System, System Memory Size, Operating System Name, Operating System Version, and Country. We will also create a Support Code and Player ID that we associate with your device. We may use this information in the aggregate or we may combine it with personal information about you.
Information We Collect Automatically; Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.
We, our Service Providers, and Third-Party Services use cookies and other tracking technologies (including technologies designed for mobile devices, called software development kits, of SDKs) ("Tracking Technologies") to track information about your use of our Services. We collect the following information about you from your use of our Services through these technologies: your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; and the length of time you visit our Site, Applications, and/or use our Services.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies ("Tracking Technologies")
Cookies are tracking technologies which are denoted by alphanumeric identifiers that we, our Service Providers, or Third-Party Services use for various purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Applications, while other cookies are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Applications. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent cookies.
Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.
Third Party Cookies. Third-Party Services collect and analyze non-personally and personally identifiable Site data. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze Site usage. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected. This Notice does not cover such third parties' use of the data.
If you are a EEA / SWISS / UK resident you can allow or reject certain cookies (which are not necessary for the Site to function) by visiting our Privacy Preference Center on our Site at www.playstudios.com.
Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse the Site, but some features may not function.
Local Storage Objects. We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. You cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the
Adobe Flash Player Help Page
, choose "
Global Storage Settings Panel
" and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "
Website Storage Settings Panel
" and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
Information we collect for analytics purposes.
We, our Service Providers, and Third-Party Services use Tracking Technologies, such as Google Analytics or Facebook Insights, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, in our Applications. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services and user experiences.
Play Activity
We also collect data about your play activity on our Applications, including what games you play, your spins, game play outcomes, your use of virtual chips, game progress, quest progress, and participation in special events or offers. You may earn Loyalty Points as you visit our Applications, and we will keep track of your Loyalty Points.
How We Use Your Information.
We and our Service Providers use the information that we gather about you for the following purposes:
To provide our Services to you and to communicate with you about your use of our Services.
To respond to your inquiries.
To fulfill your orders, facilitate redemption of Rewards, and for other customer service purposes
To track your play activity and progress in our games.
To provide personal hosted services to you.
To track Application crash events and for other quality control purposes.
To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to offer location customization, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the Site, Applications, or our Services.
Where permitted by law, and in accordance with Facebook's applicable terms and conditions, for marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may use your information, such as your email address, to email you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or information we think may interest you.
To assist in determining where to advertise our Services on third party websites. When we engage an ad service to advertise our games, we submit hashed "suppression lists" so that we arenâ€™t sending ads to players who are already playing our games. The suppression list contains hashed Ad IDs. Hashed data converts a string of characters to data of a fixed length using an algorithm.
To better understand how users access and use our Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Services, analyze player traffic and activity, respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.
To understand the effectiveness of our ads. For example, if you installed one of our Applications because you viewed a mobile ad, we will use information to identify the third-party ad network that displayed the mobile ad for us.
We also may post to your Facebook Wall, access posts in your news feeds, and access your Facebook data when you are not logged into Facebook. We will use and access this information for the purposes described in this section and as discussed below.
With your consent, as otherwise disclosed to you at the time of collection, or otherwise as required or permitted by law.
How We Share Your Information.
We may share the information that we collect from or about you as follows:
Fellow PLAYSTUDIOS App Users on Facebook. Your username and profile picture will be visible to all other PLAYSTUDIOS users who use our Applications on Facebook, regardless of whether they are your Facebook friends.
Our Rewards Partners. When you redeem a Reward, we may share certain of your information with our Rewards partners in order to facilitate the provision of the Reward to you and for the purposes stated at the time you redeem the reward. Any information that you submit to a third party will be governed by that Rewards partnerâ€™s privacy policy and not this Notice.]
Service Providers. We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf (“Service Providers”). For example:
We use Amazon Web Service and the Simple Storage Service (S3) to store information about you and your activities in our applications on databases.
We include SDKs within our Applications that transfer game transaction data to third-party service providers who monitor crashes and create error logs so that we can maintain the Applications.
We use a third-party service provider to receive support requests and transfer them to us via email.
We use third-party service providers to help us with ad attribution. The service provider receives information about how our ads are viewed and interacted with and whether the viewer downloads, installs and interacts with any of our Applications.
We use third-party service providers to facilitate running our own ads, as well as third-party mobile ads in our Applications.
Business Transfers: If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company.
In Response to Legal Process. We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena, or to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. When we do so, we comply with EU and UK data protection law.
To Protect PLAYSTUDIOS and Others. We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service or this Notice, or as evidence in litigation or other proceedings in which PLAYSTUDIOS is involved.
Aggregate and De-Identified Information. We may share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.
With your consent, as otherwise disclosed to you at the time of collection, or otherwise as required or permitted by applicable law.
Third-Party Sites and Services.
Our Site, Applications, and other Services contain links to third-party websites, applications, and services, and allow certain kinds of interactions between the Services and third-party content, web sites, applications, platform, code ((e.g., plug-ins, application programming interfaces ("API"), and software development kits ("SDKs")), and Tracking Technologies (collectively, "Third-Party Services"). Any access to and use of such Third-Party Services is not governed by this Notice, but instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those Third-Party Services. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.
Ad Vendors, Networks and Partners
We may use Service Providers and Third-Party Services to assist us in placing advertisements on our Services, as well as displaying advertisements on other websites or mobile applications. This includes advertisements based on your activity across time and sites and services (including our Site, Application, and Services) ("Interest-based Advertising").  These Vendors and Third-Party Services include third-party ad network providers, and/or traffic measurement services, as well as advertisers, sponsors, and other ad partners ("Ad Partners"). Our Vendors, Third-Party Services, and Ad Partners may use Tracking Technologies to personalize advertising content to you, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to carry out other aspects of ad delivery (such as limiting the number of times you see an ad, or frequency capping). In addition, we may provide certain personal information to these parties in order to facilitate the foregoing ad activities. For example, we may send a list of hashed email addresses that are used by one of these parties to help show an ad to you or for the other ad activities described in this Notice. Sometimes, we may use a list of hashed email addresses as a "suppression list" so that we arenâ€™t sending ads to players who are already playing our games.   In addition, we may provide these parties with information about your usage of our Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personal information about visitors to our Site and users of our Service. The Third-Party Servicesâ€™ and Ad Partnersâ€™ use and other processing of your information is governed by their respective privacy policies, not this one.
You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).
Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAIâ€™s and DAAâ€™s websites accessible by the above links.

How long will we store your personal data?
We will store your personal data no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which your personal data is processed. If you submit a request to be forgotten, we will either delete or anonymize your personal data unless we have a legal obligation to continue to store the personal data, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim. For example, if you have made purchases within any of our Applications, or redeemed a Reward, we may store your personal data for as long the statute of limitations for making a claim relating to that purchase or redemption. If you have indicated in any way that you believe you have a dispute with us, we may store your personal data at least until that dispute is resolved.
We may store anonymized data indefinitely. We maintain this type of data to compare performance of our Site, our Applications and our Services over past periods, to analyze current performance, to measure player activity over time, and for other business uses.
Access to and modification of your personal information in the Applications and on Facebook
You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. You also may deauthorize the PLAYSTUDIOS Facebook application from your Facebook page. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or Applications for a period of time.
If you would like to access or modify your Facebook profile information, or adjust the types of information we receive from Facebook, you must adjust your Facebook account settings directly through Facebook. We have no control over how Facebook shares your information with us or other third parties. The information you provide to Facebook is subject to the Facebook Privacy Policy.
Security of My Personal Information.
We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions designed to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your password private.
What Choices Do I Have Regarding Opting-Out of Promotional Emails?
We may send promotional emails to you from time-to-time. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.
As noted above, to adjust the types of information about you that we receive from Facebook, you must change your Facebook account settings directly through Facebook.
Children
Our Services are not designed for persons under 18. We do not knowingly collect information from persons under 18. If we discover that a child under the applicable age (13 in the U.S., 16 in the EEA/UK) has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.
Special Notice to California Consumers.
California residents may request a list of certain third parties to which we have disclosed certain personal information about you for the third party's own direct marketing purposes. You may make one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response to you.

Transfers of Personal Information
Your personal information is stored outside of the EEA / Switzerland / the UK. In these cases, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Notice and that adequate safeguards are in place. This includes, where necessary, taking steps to evaluate the risks raised by the transfers in countries that do not offer an adequate level of protection.
Your Rights
If you are an EEA / Swiss / UK residents, under certain circumstances, you have the right to:
request access to the personal information we hold about you;
rectify any inaccurate personal information that we may hold about you;
have your personal information erased in certain circumstances, for example, where it is no longer necessary for us to process your personal information to fulfill our processing purposes, or where you have exercised your right to object to the processing;
restrict the processing of your personal information where, for example, the information is inaccurate or it is no longer necessary for us to process such information or where you have exercised your right to object to our processing;
object to the processing of your personal information which may be exercised in certain circumstances, for example, where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes, or where your own legitimate interests outweigh ours;
have your personal information transferred to another organization.
when we rely on your consent to process personal information you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time; and
lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Online Request Form.
We have established an online submission process to facilitate requests to exercise your data privacy request.

What happens if you request us to delete your personal information?
If you request to be forgotten, we will delete, put beyond use or anonymize your personal information such that you cannot be identified from the data that we retain, unless we have a basis to maintain it (see "How long will we store your personal information?").
Please know, however, that if you request to be forgotten and subsequently download and play any of our Applications, none of your historical performance data will be available, meaning you will lose any virtual currency, game progress, and Loyalty Points that you had at the time your request is processed.
What happens if you withdraw your consent for us to process your personal information?
If you withdraw your consent for us to process your personal information, we will treat your request as a request to be forgotten. We must take this action because when you play any of our Applications, whether via a mobile device or Facebook, we obtain and process personal information.
