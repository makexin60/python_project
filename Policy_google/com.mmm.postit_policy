Additional Information for Residents in Certain Jurisdictions
Supplemental Information for Residents of Certain U.S. States (including California)
In this section, we provide additional information to residents in certain U.S. states (including California) about the categories of Personal Data we collect about you and your privacy rights under applicable privacy laws including, where applicable, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).  This section does not address or apply to our collection and processing of data that is exempt from applicable law, or information about our employees, personnel, applicants and candidates.
Our collection, use and disclosure of Personal Data varies based upon our relationship and interactions with you.  The sections below briefly explain our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Data and are followed by a chart showing how each category of Personal Data is typically used and disclosed by 3M.
Collection of Personal Data
As described above, under “
How 3M Collects Your Personal Data
”.
Use and Disclosure of Personal Data
We use Personal Data for the reasons described above, under “
How 3M Uses Your Personal Data
,” including customer service, communication, fulfillment, customer experience, personalization, direct marketing, promotions, and security and integrity.  We disclose Personal Data to our affiliates, service providers, Business Partners, and for the purposes, including to support our business operations, described above, under “
How 3M Discloses Your Personal Data
.”
The chart below generally describes each category of Personal Data that we collect, why we collect it, and who we may disclose it to, and reflects our practices during the past twelve (12) months. We collect the types of Sensitive Personal Information (as defined under the CCPA) about California residents for the purposes described in the table below; however, we do not collect, use, disclose or process Sensitive Personal Information about California residents beyond the purposes authorized by the CCPA (pursuant to Cal Civ. Code § 1798.121 and § 7027(m) of the CCPA regulations).
Certain privacy laws define a ‘sale’ as disclosing or making available to a third-party Personal Data in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and ‘sharing’ broadly, including as disclosing or making available Personal Data to a third party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.  While we do not disclose Personal Data to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, we may ‘sell’ or ‘share’ Identifiers and Internet and Electronic Network Activity Usage Information to advertising networks, data analytics providers and social networks. We do so to improve and evaluate our advertising campaigns and better reach customers and prospective customers with more relevant ads and content. We do not sell or share Sensitive Personal Information, nor do we sell or share any Personal Data about individuals who we know are under sixteen (16) years old.
Exercising Your Rights
If you are a resident of a U.S. state you may exercise your rights as described above, under “
Your Rights
.”
In addition, we offer other ways for California residents to opt out of ‘sales’ and ‘sharing’ of their Personal Data. Our U.S.  Websites responds to global privacy control—or “GPC”—signals, which means that if we detect that your browser is communicating a GPC signal, we will, subject to applicable law, process that as a request to opt that particular browser and device out of sales and sharing on our Websites. Certain residents may also opt out of any cookie and pixel related ‘sales’ and ‘sharing’ or targeted advertising on any of our Websites by adjusting your cookie privacy preferences for that Website, in our cookie preference manager, which you can access by clicking the “Privacy Choices” link, accessible in the footer of our Websites. Note that if you come back to our Websites from a different device or use a different browser on the same device, you will need to enable GPC or set your cookie preferences for each browser and device you use to access our Websites and services.  More information about GPC is available at:
