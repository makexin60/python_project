LEOGAME and its licensors own all rights, title, and interest in the Application, the
									Software, the Website, the Service, and the information and content available on or
									through the foregoing (collectively, the “LEOGAME Properties”). The LEOGAME
									Properties are protected by copyright laws throughout the world. Subject to the
									Terms, LEOGAME grants you a limited license to reproduce portions of the LEOGAME

									require you to accept updates to the Application or the Software that you have
									installed on your computer or mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that LEOGAME

”) at the time you create your Account and
									select the term of your subscription (each, a “
Service Commencement
										Dat
”). Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are
									non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and LEOGAME for the Services
									until LEOGAME or the Payment Provider, for example Apple or Google, accepts your
									order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of
									communication.
6.4 Taxes.
LEOGAME’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Service, or payments for
									any Service, are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted
									the applicable Sales Tax to LEOGAME, you will be responsible for the payment of such
									Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority and
									you will indemnify LEOGAME for any liability or expense we may incur in connection
									with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts
									issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence that you have
									paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “
Sales
										Tax
” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by
									sales proceeds, that LEOGAME its permitted to pass to its customers that is the
									functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does
									not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
6.5 Automatic Renewal.
Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the
									Terms.
After your initial subscription period, and again after any
										subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on
										the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement
										Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at LEOGAME’s
										then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be
										subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at
										least 24 hours prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into and going
										to the “Manage App Subscriptions” page in the Apple App Store or the “My Apps”
										page in the Google Play Store app. The same page will permit you to change your
										Account settings if you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or
										if you want to change or terminate your subscription.
If you cancel your
									subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current
									subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current
									term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion
									of the subscription fee paid for the then- current subscription period. By
									subscribing, you authorize LEOGAME to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at
									the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your
									subscription, if LEOGAME does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i)
									you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree
									that LEOGAME may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to
									attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of
									payment, your Account will be re-activated and for purposes of automatic renewal,
									your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was
									received).
6.6 Pre-purchased Minutes and Texts.
Users of the Telephony Service may be able to purchase calling minutes and text
									messaging packages (collectively, “
Pre-Purchased Packages
“).
									Pre-Purchased Packages are not legal tender and cannot be reloaded, resold,
									transferred for value, redeemed for cash or applied to any other account, except to
									the extent described herein or as required by applicable law. LEOGAME prohibits and
									does not recognize any purported transfers of Pre-Purchased Packages outside of the
									Telephony Services, or the purported sale, lease, gift or trade in the “real world”
									of anything that appears or originates outside of the Telephony Services.
									Accordingly, you may not trade, sell or attempt to sell Pre-Purchased Packages for
									“real” money, or exchange those items or currency for value of any kind outside the
									Telephony Services. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void,
									and will subject your Account to termination. You shall ensure that you have
									sufficient Pre-Purchased Packages in your Account before you initiate any
									transaction that requires such credits. If you have insufficient Telephony Credits
									in your Account to complete the transaction, the transaction will be cancelled. ALL
									TRANSACTIONS MADE USING Pre-Purchased Packages ARE FINAL AND ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.
7. LEOGAME Is Provided As-Is.
LEOGAME CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR CONTENT WILL BE SAFE FROM OUTSIDE ATTACKS, HACKERS
									OR OTHER WAYS OF ACCESSING YOUR CONTENT ON THE FILE SYSTEMS. YOU EXPRESSLY
									UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR USE OF THE
									LEOGAME PROPERTIES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THE LEOGAME PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED ON
									AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS. LEOGAME EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
									ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR
									IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
									MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
8. Limitation of Liability.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL LEOGAME BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
									INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN
									CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE, THE APPLICATION, THE SOFTWARE, THE SERVICE, INCLUDING
									WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER
									OR NOT LEOGAME HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNDER NO
									CIRCUMSTANCES WILL LEOGAME BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY
									LEOGAME AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD
									PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT YOU CLAIM. IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID LEOGAME
									ANY AMOUNTS DURING SUCH PERIOD, LEOGAME’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY SHALL BE
									LIMITED TO FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00).
THE TELEPHONY SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED TO SUPPORT OR CARRY EMERGENCY CALLS OR SMS
									MESSAGES TO ANY EMERGENCY SERVICES. NEITHER LEOGAME NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE
									UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE OR LOSS ARISING FROM OR
									RELATED TO THE INABILITY TO USE THE TELEPHONY SERVICES TO CONTACT EMERGENCY
									SERVICES.
9. Remedies
9.1 Violations.
If LEOGAME becomes aware of any possible violations by you of the Terms, LEOGAME
									reserves the right to investigate such violations. If, as a result of the
									investigation, LEOGAME believes that criminal activity has occurred, LEOGAME
									reserves the right to refer the matter to, and to cooperate with, any and all
									applicable legal authorities. LEOGAME is entitled, except to the extent prohibited
									by applicable law, to disclose any information or materials on the LEOGAME
									Properties, including Your Content, in LEOGAME’s possession in connection with your

									governmental request; (2) enforce the Terms; (3) respond to any claims that Your
									Content violates the rights of third parties; (4) respond to your requests for
									customer service; or (5) protect the rights, property or personal safety of LEOGAME,
									its Users or the public, and all enforcement or other government officials, as
									LEOGAME in its sole discretion believes to be necessary or appropriate.
9.2 Breach.
In the event that LEOGAME determines, in its sole discretion, that you have breached
									any portion of the Terms, or have otherwise demonstrated inappropriate conduct,
									LEOGAME reserves the right to:
(a)
Warn you via e-mail (to any e-mail address you have provided to
									LEOGAME) that you have violated the Terms;
(b)
Delete any of Your Content provided by you or your agent(s) to
									the LEOGAME Properties;
(c)
Discontinue your registration(s) with the LEOGAME Properties;

Pursue any other action which LEOGAME deems to be appropriate.
9.3 No Subsequent Registration.
If your registration(s) with or ability to access the LEOGAME Properties is
									discontinued by LEOGAME due to your violation of any portion of the Terms, then you
									agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or access the LEOGAME
									Properties through use of a different member name or otherwise, and you acknowledge
									that you will not be entitled to receive a refund for fees related to those LEOGAME
									Properties to which your access has been terminated. In the event that you violate
									the immediately preceding sentence, LEOGAME reserves the right, in its sole
									discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without
									any notice or warning to you.
10. Miscellaneous Legal Terms.
10.1 Electronic Communications
The communications between you and LEOGAME use electronic means, whether you visit
									the Website or send LEOGAME e-mails, or whether LEOGAME posts notices on the Website
									or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) agree to
									receive communications from LEOGAME in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all
									terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications
									that LEOGAME provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
									communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing. The foregoing does not
									affect your statutory rights
10.2 Release
You hereby release LEOGAME and its successors from claims, demands, any and all
									losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries,
									death, and property damage of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of
									the Terms or your use of the Website, the Application, the Software or the Service.
									If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section
									1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
									does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release,
									which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.
10.3 Assignment
The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned,
									subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without LEOGAME’s prior
									written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer
									in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
10.4 Force Majeure
LEOGAME and its licensors shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform
									resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to,
									acts of God; war; terrorism; riots; embargos; acts of civil or military authorities;
									fire; floods; accidents; strikes or shortages of transportation facilities; fuel;
									energy; labor; materials; problems with your computing or network infrastructure,
									hardware or product; problems with your internet service provider (ISP) or any sites
									you are attempting access through the VPN Service; or any electrical or other
									utility outages.
10.5 Dispute Resolution
(a) Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
										relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms where the total amount
										of the award sought is less than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $5,000.00) may
										be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based
										arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall
										be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider
										(“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under
										the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
										with the Terms. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and
										the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR
										Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:
										(1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely
										based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
										initiating the arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
										English; (3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the
										parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties; and (4)
										any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
										of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including
										attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay
										an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the
										foregoing, LEOGAME may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its
										intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note
										that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from
										California law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought,
										exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the
										international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are
										applicable to your use of the LEOGAME Properties.
(b) Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable)
										shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential
										arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not
										any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one
										commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial
										contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association
										(“
AAA
”). As modified by the Terms, and unless otherwise agreed
										upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s
										Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the
										Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively
										“
Rules and Procedures
”).
(c) You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your
										rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights
										will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are
										entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE
										LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable
										as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
(d) You and LEOGAME must abide by the following rules: (i) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY
										YOU OR LEOGAME MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
										PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING;
										(ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT
										OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY
										NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (iii) in the event that you are able to demonstrate
										that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of
										litigation, LEOGAME will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in
										connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
										arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation;
										(iv) LEOGAME also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to
										assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (v) the
										arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (vi)
										the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the
										existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by
										law or for the purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (vii) the
										arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are
										permitted by applicable law; and (viii) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees
										and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing
										party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance,
										the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by applicable law.
(e) The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in
										the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than
										English will be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or
										true copy thereof. The English language version will control. The arbitrator
										shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
										findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
										of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will not have authority to award damages
										in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 8 of the
										Terms. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of
										competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any
										temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and
										equitable and within the scope of the Terms, including, without limitation, an
										injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be
										final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted
										by California law or United States federal law.Notwithstanding the foregoing,
										either you or LEOGAME may bring an individual action in small claims court.
										Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
										and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright,
										trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.
										Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located
										in San Francisco County, California. Additionally, notwithstanding this
										agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before
										the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, in
										order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit
										to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San
										Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for interim measures
										shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
(f) With the exception of (d)(i) and (ii) above (prohibiting arbitration on a
										class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed
										to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules
										and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in
										effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
										unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If,
										however, either (d)(i) or (ii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal,
										then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and
										neither you nor LEOGAME shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason, a
										claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be
										exclusively brought in state or federal court in San Francisco County,
										California. By using the LEOGAME Properties in any manner, you agree to the
										above arbitration provision.
For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration
									claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at
http://www.adr.org
.
10.6 Choice of Law and Venue.
The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and
									under the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of
									laws principles that require the application of the law of a different state. You
									hereby expressly agree to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and
									federal courts for the county in which LEOGAME’s principal place of business is
									located for any lawsuit filed against you by LEOGAME arising from or related to the
									Terms.
10.7 Notice.
Where LEOGAME requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for
									providing LEOGAME with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last
									e-mail address you provided to LEOGAME is not valid, or for any reason is not
									capable of delivering to you any notices required/permitted by the Terms, LEOGAME’s
									dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective
									notice. You may give notice to LEOGAME at the following address: 178 Castro St., San
									Francisco, CA 94114. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by LEOGAME by
									letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class
									postage prepaid mail at the above address.
10.8 Waiver.
Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not
									be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other
									occasion.
10.9 Severability.
If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or
									unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the
									invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and
									enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
10.10 App Stores.
You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services
									is dependent on the third party from whom you received the Application license,
									e.g., the Apple iPhone or Android app stores (
“App Store”
). You
									acknowledge and agree that the Terms are between you and LEOGAME only, and not with
									the App Store. LEOGAME, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the LEOGAME
									Properties, including the Application, the contents thereof, maintenance, support
									services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g.,
									product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order
									to use the Application, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to
									pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any)
									charged by the App Store in connection with the LEOGAME Properties, including the
									Application. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Application is
									conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third- party terms of
									agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies) when using the LEOGAME
									Properties, including the Application. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its
									subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms and will have the right to
									enforce them.
10.11 Accessing and Download the Application from iTunes.
The following applies to any App Store Sourced Application accessed through or
									downloaded from the Apple App Store:
(a) You acknowledge and agree that (i) the Terms are concluded between you and
									LEOGAME only, and not Apple, and (ii) LEOGAME, not Apple, is solely responsible for
									the App Store Sourced Application and content thereof. Your use of the App Store
									Sourced Application must comply with the App Store Terms of Service.
(b) You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any
									maintenance and support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application.
(c) In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to
									any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase
									price for the App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent
									permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever
									with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. As between LEOGAME and Apple, any
									other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any
									failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of LEOGAME.
(d) You and LEOGAME acknowledge that, as between LEOGAME and Apple, Apple is not
									responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party
									relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App
									Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability
									claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to
									any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under
									consumer protection or similar legislation.
(e) You and LEOGAME acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the
									App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced
									Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between
									LEOGAME and Apple, LEOGAME, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the
									investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property
									infringement claim to the extent required by the Terms.
(f) You and LEOGAME acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are
									third party beneficiaries of the Terms as related to your license of the App Store
									Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of
									the Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right)
									to enforce the Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application
									against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
(g) Without limiting any other terms of the Terms, you must comply with all
									applicable third party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced
									Application.
10.12 Export Control.
You may not use, export, import, or transfer the LEOGAME Properties except as
									authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the
									LEOGAME Properties, and any other applicable laws. In particular, but without
									limitation, the LEOGAME Properties may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any
									United States embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury
									Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of
									Commerce’s Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the LEOGAME Properties, you
									represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a
									U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a
									“terrorist supporting” country and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government
									list of prohibited or restricted parties. You also will not use the LEOGAME
									Properties for any purpose prohibited by U.S. law, including the development,
									design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological
									weapons. You acknowledge and agree that products, services or technology provided by
									LEOGAME are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States.
									You shall comply with these laws and regulations and shall not, without prior U.S.
									government authorization, export, re-export, or transfer the LEOGAME products,
									services or technology, either directly or indirectly, to any country in violation
									of such laws and regulations..
10.13 International Users.
The LEOGAME Properties can be accessed from countries around the world and may
									contain references to Services and Content that are not available in your country.
									These references do not imply that LEOGAME intends to announce such Services or
									Content in your country. The LEOGAME Properties are controlled and offered by
									LEOGAME from its facilities in the United States of America. LEOGAME makes no
									representations that LEOGAME Properties are appropriate or available for use in
									other locations. Those who access or use the LEOGAME Properties from other
									jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with
									local law.
10.14 Questions, Complaints, and Claims.
If you have any questions, complaints or claims, please contact us at
									support@leostudio.global. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel
									that your concerns have been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with

personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us

We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
