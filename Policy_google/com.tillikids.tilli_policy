How We Protect Your Information- Security and Password
Tilli takes what it believes to be commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information. However, since no security system is impenetrable and “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information or Browsing Information. If you create an account, you may be asked to choose a password for your account, which can be used to access information associated with your account (including Personal Information). You should choose a password that is not easy to guess, and does not use words that you would find in a dictionary. Do not disclose your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and we will attribute activities that occur using your account information (e.g., through the use of your password) to you. If you suspect that your password has been compromised, contact us immediately at
support@tillikids.com

We may send you, or you may elect to sign up to receive, emails from us.

The most important point to note is that the Tilli website is not intended for children. Children need not access it. We don’t market to them and never knowingly collect any personal information from children.
All the learning and play experience that add up to the “Tilli experience” for children is limited to the Tillis app. App is tailor-made to limit the use of children’s information and protect their privacy. Our apps contain no external links to third-party websites or services.
Parents and educators can download the app from Google PlayStore. We encourage parents and educators to complete the simple onboarding process to help children get started. Downloading the app doesn’t trigger the collection of any Personally Identifiable Information.
We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA")to the best of our knowledge, and we only collect analytics data (does not include Personally Identifiable Information) from the App. This data is anonymized and used as an aggregate to solely improve the play and learning experience of the Tilli app. This data is not used for any commercial purposes.
If the service is being used by a school and/or teacher (the “Educational Institution”) with students under 16 years of age, such Educational Institution agrees that it has reviewed our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. The app only request Personally Identifiable Information from parents and/or teachers. We will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, Personally Identifiable Information from users known to be under 16 years of age. We collect only the minimum amount of information needed about students from teachers.

support@tillikids.com
