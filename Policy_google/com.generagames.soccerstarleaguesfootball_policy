2. PRIVACY POLICY
Welcome to the VIVA GAMES STUDIOS Privacy Policy. This policy describes how VIVA GAMES STUDIOS and the companies within its group (described collectively as “VIVA GAMES STUDIOS”) and its third party marketing and advertising partners collect, use, process and share information. Our games, websites, marketing and advertising activities, and other services are collectively referred to as our “Services”.
We collect information for the purpose of improving your experience and our relationship, always openly, trustworthily and legally.
This data collection is essential for giving you access to the service, providing you with support, addressing your requests and questions, and guaranteeing functionality. This is always based on respecting your privacy and rights and we offer you all the necessary information and our collaboration to guarantee that privacy.
What data do we collect in the App?
All our forms have the * symbol next to obligatory data. If you do not provide said data or if you do not give us permission to access certain smartphone elements, we cannot then register you as a user or we may deny you part or all of the service which depends on that data.
You are free to enter the optional data, such as profile configuration, photo, screen name, etc. You can also modify certain information which you have provided: use the application’s control panel, the settings, or the permissions within the settings of your smartphone.
Your Android or iOS system will ask you for permission authorizations, such as permission to use location data, which is collected so we can offer you services in your region. If we ask for any extra permissions, your phone will also display the specific authorization message. If you do not give these permissions, the service cannot be provided or its usability will be reduced.
2. User data
When you install the App, a user ID is generated via the store you use. When it is installed, the App creates its own folders which store its contents when it is used. ID data is, in principle, anonymous.
We may collect your date of birth or age, email address, user name and password, and your avatar details.
3. General data when using the games.
We may collect open profile and chat data. Furthermore,
if you choose to invite your friends
, we may collect
the email addresses of those friends
. Ensure that you have your friends’ permission before sharing this information with us.
In order to be able to post publications or interact with other users, you must be registered and you must have filled in the obligatory fields on the form. The rest of the data you provide to complete your profile is voluntary. You can put what you want in the contact forms we provide for queries.
4. Statistical data collected when the games are used
Once you access the App, we create analyses, statistics and measurements to improve that App: Differentiating between users via an exclusive and anonymous ID for the device, what the user sees, the device’s OS or when the Application is used. This data is stored locally and sent to the analytical tool in batches, every 30 minutes for Android and every 2 minutes for iOS. You can change this setting to optimize your battery.
The IDs remain the same if the Application is updated but if it is uninstalled and reinstalled, a new ID is created.
Identifiers, the IP address, the ID of the device and Application, location data at city/province/country level and player connections may be gathered via Appsflyer.com.
In terms of your device, data regarding the model, brand and operating system may be collected.
We may also collect information about use of the games, such as the date and time stamps of game events, interactions with our teams and advertising commitments and support for content developers, and registrations of transactions, or evidence of the use of cheat software or modified versions of the games.
5. Surveys about your experience
We may collect data about your interests and habits, your opinion on various products and services, and what you would like to be offered in the future. We also collect your ratings, opinions, preferences, questions, images and answers associated with that survey.
6. Information received from third parties
If you link the App to external platforms or social networks (Apple, Facebook or Google Play), certain activities could be published and content could be shared on them. We can associate your game profile with your account on the platform and receive your
third party identification, name, avatar details and city-level location
. If you give our game permission, we may also collect your
email address, friends list and date of birth
.
When you make payments in the games, we receive information from our payment processors about the transactions, including your Apple ID number for Apple, your postcode and state for Google, and user ID and transaction data via the Amazon Store.

You undertake to not use the service in any way which is not expressly permitted in the conditions.
The developer is the owner of the intellectual and industrial property rights over the App, including the graphic design, contents and databases which may be included in it.

In any way transfer, duplicate or copy, publish, distribute or provide the services, the source code or any part of the software, unless express authorization to do so is obtained.
We reserve the right to make modifications and improvements to the Application and you will be offered the updates so that it functions correctly. It is recommended that you keep the Application up-to-date.
Unauthorized use of the information contained in the App, along with any damages caused to intellectual and industrial property rights, may lead to the filing of the corresponding lawsuits and, if applicable, the liabilities arising from said suits.
The rights over the content belong to the company which owns the App or the third party which has permission to use it, and said contents are protected by law. The content includes brands, logos, trade names, distinctive symbols, services, contents, text, photos, graphics, images, software, links and any information.
Any unauthorized reproduction, distribution, public communication, commercialization or transformation of the content constitutes an infraction of said rights. Any damages caused may lead to the filing of legal actions and to civil and/or criminal liabilities.
We are authorized to manage the consumer’s acquisition and payment of the App via the website or store where they downloaded it.
In terms of content which is published or provided by the user and which may involve copyrights, you grant us permission (free, unlimited, worldwide, non-exclusive and perpetual) to use, copy, distribute and show said content on other websites, including social networks.
3. Legal age
We do not process the data of minors aged under 16 and do not permit them to access the App. Please do not provide their data or give them access if they are under age. Compliance with this requirement is your responsibility. If we suspect that you are not complying with this requirement, we will delete the account without notice. We show exceptions based on the legal regulations of each region in our Privacy Policy.
4. Conditions of the offered services
To access you must click on the Application logo. There are no passwords, you are responsible for the custody of your smartphone, we recommend that you use a phone locking password or fingerprint and that you keep it in absolute and the strictest confidentiality. Never use patterns. If more fields are required, we will request them.
The service is free but has in-game purchases that use your Google Play or Apple Store account, or the account of other stores which we may use in the future. Payments are confirmed immediately and we provide you with the purchased products straight away.
You are responsible for any false or inexact statements you make and for the damages which they may cause.
It is not permitted:
– To publish any content which may contravene the law of your country, which is malicious, over which you have no rights or which may be cruel to animals.
– To use software or code which is malicious or which may contain a virus or software that is designed to gain unauthorized access to third party computers or servers, or designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any software.
– To defame, threaten, harass or supplant users or to violate their privacy.
– To send junk or chain mail, etc.
5. Prices, applicable taxes and duties
The applicable prices of the in-game purchases are shown in the App in euros and include tax. The Store controller automatically translates them to your local currency and adds the corresponding taxes.
6. Cancellation of the right of withdrawal
By law, there is a right to withdraw from a contract within 14 calendar days after you make a purchase, but this is not applicable to computer programs and applications with online downloads given that, due to their nature, the files are installed immediately on the user’s computer and can be used permanently for as long as that computer is not connected to the internet.
7. Returns for malfunctions
Google allows you to return your purchase within 2 hours, on specific grounds. Apple allows returns if the content is not installed. For both sites, the only admitted cause for a legal return is if the application does not work, although if you have downloaded it, played it and then purchased it, we will deem that it worked correctly previously. Furthermore, Google analyzes devices before making a download to find out whether or not that download will work. Apple knows that a device is one of its own models and that the Applications work.
Therefore, we may ask you for information to check that it did not function since you made the purchase, and we will reject all unjustified or abusive requests. In the event that you do not receive the products you purchased in the game, please contact us and we will look into what occurred. We will attempt to provide you with the product and we will only reimburse the amount you paid in the event that this is not possible.
8. De-registering
You can uninstall the App whenever you want. We can de-register you or stop providing the service with no prior notice, simply by notifying you of such, and with no liability. You will not be reimbursed for purchases made in the Applications although while the App is still installed on your device you will still be able to use the parts which are offline.
9. Liability
The Application is shown in its current state of development and the features which it has at any point in time are always adapted to the services on offer. We solely and exclusively guarantee its suitability for the services offered and for the platform or operating system for which it was developed.
In no circumstances do we guarantee the availability of the services or the veracity of the advertisements which may be offered through the App, seeing as these depend on circumstances outside of our control, such as the availability or correct function of the device or terminal on which the App is installed or the telecommunications networks. We will not be liable for damages of any nature which may arise from the aforementioned lack of availability, accessibility and functionality of the services when this is due to the previously stated reasons.
We do not assume any commitment to upgrades or continuity maintenance, and therefore at any time the App may be replaced or simply cease to be available, with no obligation or liability regarding the users.
4.10.Applicable law, jurisdiction and validity
These Conditions are governed by Spanish legislation and were originally written in Castilian Spanish. In the event of doubt, the Castilian Spanish version shall be prevalent over any translation errors.
As the consumer has the benefit of protection laws, they can file claims or lawsuits from the jurisdictional area of their home address. Expressly renouncing any other jurisdiction, both parties subject themselves to the Courts and Tribunals of Seville (Spain) in the following circumstances:
– If the purchaser’s home address is outside the European Union and in a country with no bilateral or multilateral agreement with Spain which impedes the possibility of fixing express submission to a jurisdictional area;
– If the matter concerns a sale-purchase made by a company which is acting within its business or professional framework.
4.11.Resolution of online disputes
If you are a citizen of the EU, according to Regulation (EU) 524/2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes (ODR), we hereby inform you that as a consumer you are entitled to proceedings to resolve the various suits that may result from online sales in the EU.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
