Last Updated: December 19, 2024
This policy explains Resonant Cavity LLC’s (“RC”) information practices, defines your privacy options and describes how your personal information is collected and used.
This policy covers this website (the “RC Website”) and the various web, desktop and mobile applications (collectively the “Applications”) made available by RC. The RC Website and the Applications are owned and operated by RC, a company organized under the laws of Minnesota.
Should you have privacy questions or concerns, send an email to
privacychief@resonantcavity.com
.
By using or visiting the RC Website or using the Applications, you agree to the collection and use of information in the manner described in this policy.
If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, then you should immediately discontinue use of the RC Website and the Applications without providing us with any personal information.
RC shall have right at any time and without prior notice, at its sole discretion, to revise this policy. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by email, by means of a notice the next time you log in to the RC Website, by means of a notice on the RC Website homepage or when you next activate the Application, at our discretion. Such revisions and additions shall be effective immediately upon notice. You are responsible for reviewing the RC Website or Applications periodically for any modifications to this policy. Any access or use of the RC Website or Applications by you after notice of modifications to this policy shall constitute and be deemed to be your agreement to such modifications.
1. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
This policy applies to all information collected on the RC Website, any information you provide to RC, any information you may submit to the Applications when you download the Applications or information that results from your use of the Applications. We may also collect personal information from the device that you use to access the RC Website and/or Applications and from cookies and similar technologies. We may collect the following categories of personal information:
Identifiers
We may collect your name, username, and email address. We do NOT collect passwords; rather, we allow users to create an account through certain third-party platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Apple. If you choose to sign in using these services, information like your name, email address, profile picture, language preference, and an access token will be shared with us.
Commercial Information
We may collect your order history, including whether you have enrolled in a subscription. If you purchase a subscription through any of the Applications, subscription billing is handled by the application store through which the Application was downloaded (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store).
User-generated Content
We collect the information and content of material that you share through the RC Website and the Applications. This may include information you post to your profile, voice recordings, survey responses, and messages you send to us through email or social media.
Device Information
We may collect device information when you visit the RC Website and/or use any of our Applications. Device information may include your device type, browser type, online identifiers, IP address, and geolocation information.
Internet Activity
We may collect information concerning your interaction with the RC Website and/or Applications, including when you access the RC Website and/or an Application and your browsing activity (such as which pages your visit, in what order, and for how long). This may include “traffic data” or tracking information provided by the RC Website’s host or similar providers (e.g., Google Analytics) and may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the RC Website and the Applications.
You are not required to provide all personal information in this Privacy Policy to use the RC Website or the Applications, or to interact with us, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide certain personal information. For example, if you do not provide certain personal information, we may not be able to respond to your requests, allow you to register an account, or provide you with promotional notices that we believe you may find valuable.
2. COOKIES AND AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION
We store certain information that gets collected automatically at our end through cookies and other similar technologies. A cookie is a small string of information that a website that you visit transfers to your browser for identification purposes. Cookies can be used to follow your activity while using a website or across websites, and that information helps companies understand your preferences and tendencies, as well as improve and personalize your website experience. Some cookies are necessary to operate a website, while others can be functional or analytical. Cookies on the RC Website are generally divided into the following categories:
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These are required for the operation and security of the RC Website. These include, for example, cookies that optimize website security and to detect and prevent fraud.
Analytical/Performance Cookies.
These allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors to the RC Website and understand how such users navigate through the RC Website (e.g., when and which pages are visited, in what order the pages are visited, and where a user is located).
We also use Google Analytics for part of this process. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. Google provides users with the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics—learn more by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Functional Cookies.
These improve the functional performance of the RC Website and make it easier for you to use. These cookies qualify as persistent cookies because they remain on your device for use during your next visit to the RC Website. You can delete these cookies as detailed below.
You can also prevent the use of certain cookies by modifying your Internet browser settings, typically under the sections “Help,” “Internet Options,” or “Settings.” If you disable or delete certain cookies in your Internet browser settings, you may still access the RC Website, however, you might not be able to access or use important functions or features of the RC Website.
We also work with third-party analytics companies and advertising networks to understand how our Applications are used and to display advertisements that we believe will be relevant to you. We use AdMob from Google for part of this process. You can opt out of personalized advertisements under the “Settings” section of our Applications.
Do-Not-Track Signals
At this time, we do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which include “do-not-track” instructions.
