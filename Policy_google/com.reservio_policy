A. RESERVIO BOOKING SYSTEM AND RESERVIO MARKETPLACE
In providing the RESERVIO Booking System service and the RESERVIO Marketplace service, Reservio is qualified both as a
personal
data
controller
and as a
personal data processor
.
1. Reservio as the personal data controller
Reservio acts as a personal data controller in relation to the personal data of Users (if they are individuals or representatives of Users). The Partner is also considered a User.
Why do we process personal data?
Reservio processes, not by way of limitation, the following personal data for the purpose of fulfilling an agreement (in particular, concluding the agreement, communicating with the User) or performing legal obligations (in particular, bookkeeping, issuing and recording tax documents):

. The legal basis for processing in this case is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR – performance of an agreement and Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR – performance of legal obligations.

Reservio processes the following personal data based on its legitimate interest (providing direct marketing – sending commercial communications):
e-mail, telephone number
. The legal basis for processing in this case is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR – legitimate interest.

10
years after the termination of the contractual relationship.

Where the use of personal data is necessary to protect our legitimate interests, Reservio processes personal data for the period necessary to exercise these rights.
Where do we obtain personal data from?
We obtain personal data directly from data subjects when concluding agreements. We always inform data subjects which personal data are required for the purpose of the particular agreement.
2. Reservio as the personal data processor
Reservio provides the User with data space for storing data operated within the RESERVIO Booking System service and the RESERVIO Marketplace service on Reservio servers. The stored data may also include personal data of individuals. As far as the personal data that will be stored on our servers (End Customers who make a reservation) are concerned, we qualify as a data processor. The controller of these personal data in this case is the User themselves.
Notice to End Customers
Use of the RESERVIO Booking System or RESERVIO Marketplace may be subject to the policies and rules of the User, if applicable. If you provide your personal data to a User, please address any questions about privacy directly to the User who is qualified as the data controller. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or security practices employed by Users, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.
What is the purpose of the processing and how do we handle the data?
Reservio will not perform any operations with the User´s data, including personal data, except for storing them on Reservio´s servers, will not interfere with them in any way, change them, make them available or transfer them to third parties (except for their disclosure to state authorities in accordance with the law), unless otherwise stipulated in the concluded agreement. The sole purpose of handling such personal data is their storage and potential disclosure to the User.
What personal data do we process?
We only process the personal data of End Customers that were filled in the RESERVIO Booking System or RESERVIO Marketplace. This may include, by way of example and in no way limited:
name, surname, e-mail, telephone
.
For how long will your personal data be processed?
Reservio processes personal data for the duration of the contractual relationship with the User. After the User cancels the account, all data will be deleted.
B. PERSONAL DATA OF END CUSTOMERS WHEN REGISTERING IN THE CUSTOMER APPLICATION AND/OR ON THE MARKETPLACE WEBSITE
Reservio acts as the controller of personal data of End Customers within the registration in the Customer Application and/or on the Marketplace Website.
Why do we process personal data?
Reservio processes in particular the following personal data for the purpose of fulfilling an agreement (in particular, concluding the agreement, communicating with the User) or performing legal obligations (in particular, bookkeeping, issuing and recording tax documents):
name, surname, telephone, e-mail
. The legal basis for processing in this case is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR – performance of an agreement and Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR - performance of legal obligations.
As part of our performance of the agreement, we also send educational e-mails to Users that contain instructions, tips or information about advanced features of the RESERVIO Booking System. The purpose of these communications is to allow Users to use the RESERVIO Booking System more efficiently. Educational emails never contain marketing communications from Reservio or any third party.
Reservio processes the following personal data based on its legitimate interest (providing direct marketing – sending commercial communications):
e-mail, telephone number
. The legal basis for processing in this case is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR – legitimate interest.
Processing by Reservio of personal data in addition to those specified in this Article, or for other purposes, requires a validly granted consent to the processing of personal data. Consent to the processing of personal data must be given on a separate document.
We will not process special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences within the meaning of Article 10 of the GDPR.
For how long do we process personal data?
Personal data of Users are processed for the duration of the contractual relationship and subsequently for a maximum of
10
years after the termination of the contractual relationship. Personal data processed for the performance of obligations arising from specific laws and regulations are processed for the period required by the applicable legislation. Where the use of personal data is necessary to protect our legitimate interests, Reservio processes personal data for the period necessary to exercise these rights.
Where do we obtain personal data from?
We obtain personal data directly from data subjects when concluding agreements. We always inform data subjects which personal data are required for the purpose of the particular agreement.
How are personal data transferred to Partners?
We transfer the personal data of End Users to Users with whom End Users are interested in making a reservation. End Users would not be able to make a reservation with the Partner without the transfer of personal data of End Users. In relation to the personal data thus obtained, Partners act as data controllers and therefore the
transfer of personal data requires the End User's informed consent to the transfer of personal data
.
C. RESERVIO PAYMENTS SERVICE

When activating the RESERVIO Payment Service, we process the following personal data:

Personal data will be processed for the duration of the service and for 10 years after its termination or the last transaction.

The legal basis for processing in this case is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR  – performance of an agreement and Article 6(1)(c) GDPR – performance of legal obligations.

The personal data will be processed for the duration of the service and for 10 years after its termination or the last transaction.
