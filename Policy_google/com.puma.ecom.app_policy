Privacy Policy
We value the trust you place in us. That's why we insist upon the highest standards for secure transactions and customer information privacy. Please read the following to learn about our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Note:
Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time without notice. To make sure you are aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically.
By visiting this Website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our Website.
By mere use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use.
1. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and other Information
When you use our Website, we collect and store your personal information which is provided by you from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Website to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.
Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.
If you choose to buy on the Website, we collect information about your buying behaviour.
If you transact with us, we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit / debit card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment instrument details and tracking information from cheques or money orders.
If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Website, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card / debit card / other payment instrument details, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with us. While you can browse some sections of our Website without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require registration. We do use your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests.
2. Use of Demographic / Profile Data / Your Information
We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal information to assist sellers in handling and fulfilling orders, enhancing customer experience, resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service; collect money; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize and enhance your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyse demographic and profile data about our users' activity on our Website.
We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our Website, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in and to display content according to your preferences.
Cookies
A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a web server on a web browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user. We place both permanent and temporary cookies in your computer's hard drive. The cookies do not contain any of your personally identifiable information.
3. Sharing of personal information
We may share personal information with our other corporate entities and affiliates. These entities and affiliates may market to you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-out.
We may disclose personal information to third parties. This disclosure may be required for us to provide you access to our Services, for fulfillment of your orders, or for enhancing your experience, or to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our User Agreement, to facilitate our marketing and advertising activities, or to prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraudulent or illegal activities related to our Services. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their marketing and advertising purposes without your explicit consent.
We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement offices, third party rights owners, or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.
4. Security Precautions
Our Website has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

Privacy Policy
Effective December, 2024
PUMA, and the PUMA group of companies (collectively, “PUMA” or "we", "us", or "our") respects the privacy of all of our visitors and pledges to provide you with the best online experience possible. This PUMA Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes what Personal Information (defined below) we collect from you via our Services (defined below), how we may use it and the steps we take to ensure that it is protected. This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information we may collect from you through any PUMA online services that posts this Privacy Policy, including our mobile app(s) for users located in the U.S. and Canada, as well as offline collection through our retail stores located in the U.S. and Canada, PUMA sponsored events, PUMA emails originated from the U.S. and Canada, and official PUMA operated surveys and sweepstakes entry forms, or in any other instance when you contact our operations in the U.S. and Canada (collectively “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to our job applicants or current or former employees or contractors except to the extent that they use our website and with regard to our biometric retention statement and with regard to how to make a privacy rights request.
BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, ON ANY COMPUTER, MOBILE PHONE, TABLET, CONSOLE OR OTHER PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC DEVICE (COLLECTIVELY, "DEVICE"), OR BY OTHER METHOD, YOU CONSENT TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY.
PUMA may modify this Privacy Policy at any time effective upon its posting, and additional privacy notices or policies may also apply. Your continued use of our products and services constitutes your acceptance to this Privacy Policy, applicable additional notices and policies and any updates. By using our Services, you agree to the Service’s
Terms & Conditions
governing the use of the Services and accept our practices as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Do not use the Service if you do not ACCEPT this Privacy Policy and AGREE TO the Terms and Conditions.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW
We collect information you give us or permit us to access. We may also collect information regarding your interaction with, and use of, our products and services. Information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, your name, image, birth date, email and physical address, when necessary credit card information, IP address, telephone number or mobile phone identifier, gender, contact lists, social media information, location (including GPS) information, activity and performance information, Device identifier and hardware information, browser type and language, cookie information, system type, whether you have enabled software to access certain features, access times, referring website URLs, information about your purchases and other information about your interactions with us.
For example, we collect information you provide via any of our customer service channels including via phone, email, SMS and chat, and such information and your communications may be monitored, recorded, disclosed, reviewed, accessed and used by us and our third party vendors to improve the quality of goods and services we provide and the quality of services provided by our third party vendors.
Additionally, some of our service providers and vendors including, without limitation, customer service vendors may utilize artificial intelligence (“AI”) to provide you with user-friendly and responsive feedback. In some instances, the AI utilized by these partners is based on algorithms that learn from existing data and other data that you and other users provide.
We also collect information about gift and eGift Card recipients provided by the giver.
As more fully explained in the next section, we may automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Services, or shop in our stores, including:
Log and Usage Information:
We collect information about your use of the Services, such as the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, items placed in your cart, links clicked, browsing behavior, and the referring URL (the webpage you visited before navigating to the Services). We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve our Services, to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience, and to personalize the Services, our communications with you, and your shopping experience.
Device Information:
We collect information about the device you use to access the Services, including the hardware model, IP address, unique device identifiers and operating system and version.
Transaction Information:
When you purchase or return a product, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details and the date and location of the purchase/return.
Video Data:
We use video cameras in our stores for security purposes, loss prevention, and asset protection. We may also use cameras in our stores for operational purposes, such as traffic pattern analysis. We will not use cameras to personally identify you, without your consent, except when the identification is for safety, security, anti-theft, or law enforcement purposes.
RFID Data:
We may use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) for inventory management and logistics support. RFID tags consist of a small chip and antenna that provide a unique identifier for objects. RFID serves the same purpose as a bar code and must be scanned by a specific type of reader in close proximity to the tag to retrieve tag data. RFID is not used to track or monitor any items once you leave our stores.
WiFi Data:
Some of our retail stores may offer free Wi-Fi services to visitors. Wi-Fi routers capture certain data, such as Device information and telemetry data related to signal strength and quality related to your use of our Wi-Fi service, and we may analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how customers move through our stores.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies:
As more fully explained in the next section, we (and our service providers and third parties) may use cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels") and other collection or tracking technologies (“Data Technologies”) to record and collect information about you when you interact with the Services, including information about your interaction with the Services such as mouse movements, click and keystroke behavior, indicated preferences, mobile app or site visit behavior, browsing and purchasing behavior. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving our websites and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our sites are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked and for other business purposes. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see the Cookies section below.
If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes that we sponsor, we may, in addition to the above, collect the information to administer the sweepstakes, or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection, such as your contact information, your product size information, your preferences, your location, and other information you provide to us.
Additionally, we may collect your mobile telephone number in connection with SMS/MMS programs, including for shipment notifications and marketing purposes. We will use mobile telephone information you provide through the Services to transmit your mobile messages and respond to you, if necessary. This includes, but is not limited to, disclosing information to platform providers, phone companies, and other vendors who assist us in the delivery of mobile messages. For more information regarding SMS/MMS programs, visit:
https://www.sinch.com/privacy-policy
.
We may also collect Personal Information in connection with the processing and evaluation of a job application and related materials submitted by you. For more information,
click here.
We may derive Personal Information or draw inferences about you based on the other types of Personal Information we collect. For example, we may infer location based on IP address, or make product recommendations based on browsing or purchasing behavior in connection with the Services.
We may combine information you give us with other information from PUMA sources, transactions and communications. This may include, but is not limited to, information from PUMA retail stores, direct mail, catalogs, promotions, collaborations, events, products and applications, or other PUMA interactions. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data from third parties. To the extent non-Service information is combined with Personal Information collected via the Services, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
COOKIES AND DATA TECHNOLOGIES
We, our service providers and third parties may use cookies and other Data Technologies, including but not limited to tracking pixels, to gather information about your visits on our website, mobile apps and other Services so we can enhance your experience. This information may be combined with other information, which will enable us to analyze and better customize your visits.
What Are Cookies? Cookies are data files stored within your browser when you interact with a website. These data files allow the website to recall important information about your visit, help better understand your preferences and improve your overall experience. For example, we use cookies to save products in your shopping cart while you browse our websites and to track the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns. Similarly, a tracking pixel or web beacon is a technology that can recognize specific cookies and convey information about that browser. We, and third parties, may also use technologies, such as our own, and third party, cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. Furthermore, when using Data Technologies from our advertising partners such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and others, we may use an “advanced matching” feature, in which data such as name, address, email address, telephone number, social media ID and browsing behavior is collected and shared with those partners in a pseudonymous manner in order to serve you advertising that is relevant to you based on your interactions with us. You can opt out of this collection and sharing by selecting Manage Cookies in the footer and opting out of
Social Media and Advertising
cookies or by adjusting your browser settings.
There are generally three categories of cookies used on the Services:
Functional:
These cookies are required for basic functionality and are therefore always enabled. If you disable them our Services may not function properly. These include cookies that allow you to be remembered as you explore and use our Services within a single session or, if you request, from session to session. They help make the shopping cart and checkout process possible as well as assist in security issues and conforming to regulations.
Performance and Analytics:
These cookies allow us to improve the Services' functionality by tracking usage, including through session replay. In some cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to remember Services preferences you have selected. These cookies also help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to all of our visitors and what promotions visitors like to see, and to gauge the success of our advertising campaigns. Refusing these cookies will limit recommendations and customizations while using the Services.
Social Media and Advertising:
Social media cookies offer the possibility to connect you to your social networks and share content from the Services through social media. Advertising cookies collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests. In some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your Personal Information. Refusing these cookies may result in seeing advertising that is not as relevant to you or you not being able to link effectively with Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks and/or not allowing you to share content on social media.
Your browser can also help you manage cookies. Most, but not all, browsers accept cookies automatically. You may be able to set your browser to reject and/or delete cookies. You may limit or turn off cookies and other collection tools by adjusting your browser settings. If you turn off certain collection tools, you may not have access to many features that make your experience more efficient and some of our services and features may not function properly. We recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so we can offer you a better shopping experience on our sites.
Some information about your use of the Services and certain other online services may be collected using Data Technologies across time and services and used by PUMA and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain other online services. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, PUMA currently does not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com
, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties may, however, offer you choices regarding their tracking technologies. PUMA is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third-party notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see below. We may, from time-to-time, and in certain jurisdictions, offer or point you to tools that allow you to exercise certain preferences regarding cookies and other Data Technologies associated with the Services, but such tools rely on third parties and third party information so we do not guaranty that the tools will provide complete and accurate information or be completely effective.
Some advertising and technology partners may also collect Personal Information when you use the Services. For example, we may work with other companies, such as Google, who use tracking technologies to analyze how users use the Services and to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. For more information about how data is collected and processed in connection with the Google Analytics service and how to opt out, visit
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
. To learn more about data Google collects and how your data may be used, and to optout of certain Google browser Interest-Based Advertising, please visit
http://www.google.com/settings/ads
.
Some third party Data Technology operators that may be associated with our Services may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
) (U.S.),
http://youradchoices.ca/choices
(Canada), and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g. from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g. mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. PUMA supports the ad industry’s
Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising
and expects that ad networks we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance.
USE OF INFORMATION
We may use your information subject to this Privacy Policy, including information that is defined as personal information, personally identifiable information or personal data under applicable laws (“Personal Information”) except as restricted by applicable law, including without limitation for:
Enhancing, personalizing and customizing user experiences, such as placing an order and other activities.
Communicating with you about your purchase, account information or customer service.
Analyzing user behavior and trends to better understand our customers and gain consumer insights.
Providing and conducting marketing and promotions.
Communicating with you about our products, services and events, and for other promotional purposes.
Administering contests, promotions, events, surveys or other features.
Displaying relevant marketing to you and other information about PUMA.
Processing your registration, manage your account and/or upload your user generated content (“UGC”).
Transacting with you.
Improving the Service and for any other internal business purposes.
Preventing and addressing fraud, breach of policies or terms, and threats or harm.

We only send you text communications or promotional emails if you have opted to receive PUMA emails and/or SMS messages. If you no longer want to receive SMS messages, or promotional emails, or want to delete/update your Personal Information, please visit the
My Account
page or opt-out by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions in the message or by
Contacting Us
.
You can cancel text messages at any time. To stop receiving marketing text messages from PUMA, please reply “STOP” to the PUMA marketing text message. After you send "STOP", we may send you an additional text message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. You will no longer receive text messages from that short code, but you may receive text messages if you are subscribed to other text lists. If at any time you have questions about the text messages, text "HELP". After you send "HELP" we will respond with instructions on how to use our service as well as how to unsubscribe. Please note this preference will only apply to the phone number in receipt of the text. Message and data rates may apply.
PROTECTION AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION
PUMA uses technical and organizational measures designed to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, theft, and loss. While PUMA strives to protect its user's Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee 100% the security or confidentiality of any information that you provide to us or that is otherwise disclosed by you online. We recommend that you take additional measures to protect yourself and your information, such as installing anti-virus software, closing browsers after use, keeping confidential your log-in credentials and passwords. We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
We retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to provide our products and services to you and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, maintaining business and financial records, resolving disputes, maintaining security, detecting, and preventing fraud and abuse, and enforcing our agreements. The criteria used to determine retention periods includes the legal limitation of liability period, agreed contractual provisions, applicable regulatory requirements, and industry standards.
While we do not collect biometric data from the public, in instances where we collect employee biometric data, we only retain such biometric data for as long as necessary for the purpose of the collection of the biometric data and delete such biometric data when the purpose for collecting such data has been satisfied or within one year of the employee’s last interaction with the Company, whichever is earlier to occur.
DISCLOSING AND TRANSFERING OF INFORMATION
Subject to applicable law, this Privacy Policy and any representations made by us in writing at the time of collection, we may disclose your information except as restricted by applicable law. For instance, we may disclose your information, including Personal Information, with our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as to our partners, vendors, distributors, and suppliers, some of which may be outside the United States. We may transfer your information to certain service providers in order to conduct our business operations. For example, we may disclose your information to service providers who may provide the following services on our behalf: web hosting, credit card processing, shipping and order fulfillment, data management, email distribution, marketing, market research, analytics, customer service, website utilization, information analysis, and promotions management. We may also share some of your account details (such as your name, email address, password and date of birth) with our cloud service providers for the purposes of identification and authentication, so you can conveniently access your account. We may also disclose your information as is necessary to complete a transaction or provide a product, service, or feature that you have requested. These service providers will only use your information for the purpose of carrying out the services provided to PUMA. We may disclose information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property or safety. We may disclose information to prevent illegal uses of PUMA's products and services or violations of the
Terms & Conditions
, or applicable additional terms, or to defend ourselves against third party claims. We may also disclose information to companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information based upon your use of the Services.
Your information may be transferred to a third party as a part of our business assets in a sale of a part or all of PUMA, or in connection with a merger, financing or other corporate transaction.
You may also choose to disclose certain information publicly (e.g., when you post UGC) or with specific third parties (e.g., when you interact with third party Data Technologies or other services (e.g., social media plug-ins, links to other sites, etc.). When you use certain services, you agree to publicly share a basic amount of information, which may include your username, city location, and profile picture in accordance with the terms of those services. In order to participate in certain features, you may have to adjust your privacy settings and share additional information. You may also choose to disclose your activity on other platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Please read the privacy policies of those platforms, because your PUMA activity published on those platforms will no longer be governed by this Privacy Policy.
Our digital operations are conducted, in whole or in part, in the United States and our services are intended for U.S. users. Regardless of where you live, you consent to have your information, including Personal Information, transferred, processed and stored in the United States, and other jurisdictions, and allow PUMA to collect and process your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
CHILDRENS' PRIVACY
We do not knowingly collect or solicit “Personal Information” as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) (“Children’s Personal Information”) online from children under the age of 13. The Services are intended for a general audience. If we obtain knowledge that we have collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA we will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us as directed below in the “Contact Us” section.
THIRD PARTY SERVICES
The Services may include or link to third-party websites, apps, locations, platforms, code (e.g., plug-ins, application programming interfaces (“API”), and software development kits (“SDKs”)) or other third-party services. These third-party services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Data Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain third-party services, such as third party social networks (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a third-party service; “liking” or “sharing” PUMA content; logging in to the Service using your third-party service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a third-party service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other third-party services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the third-party service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with PUMA in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by PUMA. Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any third-party service.
We may engage and work with service providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on other online services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of precise location and/or cross-device data, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (“Interest-based Advertising”), which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”).
PUMA is not responsible for, and makes no representations regarding, the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics service providers and third-party services associated with the Services. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
OPT-OUT, DELETE OR MODIFY INFORMATION
You may cancel your Account or opt-out of receiving promotional e-mail messages from PUMA at any time. To unsubscribe and stop receiving SMS text or commercial e-mail communications from PUMA, you can change your Account settings or follow the instructions enclosed within the e-mail, text message, notification or other promotional message or communication. You can access, update, or correct certain information stored within your Account at any time by logging into your account and updating your preferences. However, this will only affect your account profile and not other Personal Information that we have about you. You may also request access, correction, or deletion of your personal information by contacting us as described in the
Contact Us
section, however how we process this request will be within our discretion subject to the rights that certain state residents have. We may require you to prove your identity if you make such a request. PUMA may keep information and content in our backup files and archives as required or permitted by applicable law.
In addition, as discussed below, depending on where you reside, you may have broader rights such as to (i) object to or request the restriction of processing of your Personal Information, (ii) request to know more about and access the Personal Information we collect, use, and disclose about you, (iii) request deletion of your Personal Information, (iv) request correction of inaccurate Personal Information, or (v) opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information for the purpose of targeted advertising. For more information on these rights and how to exercise them, see our California Privacy Notice and State Notice below. These state specific rights must be exercised separately from the general rights described in the paragraph above.

California law provides consumers (that are California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This California Privacy Rights Notice (“California Notice”) supplements the PUMA Privacy Policy. It applies solely to California consumers and addresses Personal Information we collect online and offline. This California Notice does not apply to PUMA employees or personnel, except with respect to how to exercise rights. This California Notice uses certain terms that have the meaning given to them in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020) and its implementing regulations.

Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing
Right to Nondiscrimination
Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Information
I. Right to Know.
If you are a consumer who resides in California you have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, a report that details the categories of Personal Information collected about you, the categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected, the purposes for collecting the Personal Information, the categories of Personal Information that we disclose for a business purpose, sell or share and the categories of third parties with whom the information is shared, and the specific pieces of Personal Information collected about you. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice.
II. Right to Correct
. If you are a consumer who resides in California you have the right to correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice.
III. Right to Deletion.
If you are a consumer who resides in California you have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, as explained below, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information, unless an exception applies. If an exception applies, we will inform you of that and limit retention and use to the permitted purpose. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice.
IV. Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.
If you are a customer who resides in California, you also have the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. While we do not sell (as “sell” is traditionally defined) your Personal Information to third parties, we do disclose information to third parties for advertising purposes which may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of “Personal Information” under California law for which you are entitled to opt-out. California residents may opt out of the “sale/share” of Personal Information by submitting a Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information (https://us.puma.com/us/en/do-not-sell-my-personal-information) request. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice. Note that you also can use the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) to signal your opt-out preference as explained in the
Exercising Your Rights
section below. We do not knowingly sell Personal Information of consumers under the age of 16.
V. Right to Nondiscrimination.
You have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights under California law.
Financial Incentives
We offer various financial incentives that might qualify as a “financial incentive” program under the CCPA. For example, we may provide discounts, coupons and other benefits for customers who sign up to receive our marketing emails. When you participate in a financial incentive, we may collect Personal Information from you, such as identifiers such as your name and email address and commercial information such as your purchase history. Participation in financial incentive program is optional for California consumers and any terms and conditions will be made available at the point of opt-in or in a confirming email. You can opt into a financial incentive by following the sign-up or participation instructions provided, and you have the ability to opt-out of the financial incentive, or our subsequent use of your Personal Information in connection with a financial incentive, at any time by contacting us as set out above, or as otherwise described in program terms, or by making a deletion request. If we condition the benefits on any limitation of your California privacy rights (e.g., you must consent to continued receipt of marketing to receive ongoing benefits), the benefits provided will be reasonably related to the value of the Personal Information provided, as will be more fully explained in the program terms. If you do not believe that the value you receive is reasonably related to the value of your applicable Personal Information, do not participate.
VI. Right to Limit the Use or Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
. Except with regard to our HR data subjects (i.e., California job applicants and current or former employees and independent contractors), we only process sensitive Personal Information for purposes that are exempt from choice under California law. If you are a HR data subject who resides in California, you may request PUMA limit sensitive Personal Information processing to certain purposes and if you do so we will explain in a response what processing purposes California law does not allow you to limit. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice.
You may also obtain information on how to make, and may submit, a request by asking a manager at any of our California retail locations. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of the rights that are provided to you under California law.
Exercising Your Rights
To exercise your rights to know, delete, correct, and/or limit our processing of sensitive Personal Information, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Calling us at: 1-888-565-PUMA (7862) (tel:1-888-565-7862)
Submitting a
Customer Privacy Rights Request Form
Emailing us at:
consumerprivacy.us@puma.com
, or
Writing to us at:
PUMA
Attn: Privacy Officer
455 Grand Union Boulevard
Somerville MA, USA 02145
To exercise a Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information request:
Opt-out for non-cookie Personal Information
: To opt-out of the sale/sharing of your non-cookie Personal Information (e.g., your email address), you may make an opt-out request here (https://us.puma.com/us/en/do-not-sell-my-personal-information).
Opt-out for cookie Personal Information
: To opt-out of the sale/sharing of such Personal Information, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool by selecting the “
Cookie Settings
” link in the footer. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-out of cookie Personal Information and to non-cookie Personal Information. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device. You must exercise your preferences on each of our websites you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool. Beware that if you use ad blocking software, our cookie banner may not appear when you visit our services and you may have to use the link above to access the tool.
Use of Global Privacy Control
: Businesses are required to process global privacy control (“GPC”) signals, which is referred to in California as opt-out preference signals (“OOPS”), which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the sale and sharing of Personal Information. To use an OOPS/GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the OOPS/GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website. We process OOPS/GPC with respect to sales and sharing that may occur in the context of collection of cookie Personal Information by tracking technologies online by third-party digital businesses and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable OOPS/GPC. We currently do not, due to technical limitations, process OOPS/GPC for opt-outs of sales and sharing in other contexts (e.g., non-cookie Personal Information). We
do not
: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled OOPS/GPC; (2) change your experience with any product or service if you use OOPS/GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC. To learn more about the GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
.  If you delete cookies or reset your device, you may need to set your preference again to ensure we continue to honor your preferred choice.
You may also obtain information on how to make, and may submit, a request by asking a manager at any of our California retail locations.
Verifying and Fulfilling Requests
To protect your privacy and comply with the California law, and except in connection with a Do Not Sell/Share request, we will need to verify your request (i.e., verify you). The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information, and in the cases more sensitive or important Personal Information we require that be done to a high degree of certainty. We do this in a number of ways depending upon how we have interacted with you in the past, as more fully described in the next section. For security purposes, we will not collect sensitive Personal Information as part of the verification process. We do not use Personal Information you provide during verification for other purposes other than to keep a record of your request.
Describe your request with enough detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We may not be able to fully respond to your right to know, deletion, or correction requests if we cannot verify your identity consistent with the standards for verification and security and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. Once we receive your request, we are required to verify that you are the person that is the subject of the request, or an authorized agent property acting on behalf of a specific consumer. How we do this will depend on the content of the consumer relationship with us and the sensitivity of the Personal Information. Typically, this consists of matching identifying information provided by you with the information we have about you in our records.
Upon making a request, you will be asked to provide your
full name, e-mail address, shipping address and telephone number
. Providing accurate information that matches our records is necessary so that we can locate the correct information within our systems and among our service providers. To verify your request, we may ask you to submit evidence beyond your basic Personal Information in order to prove your identity, especially if you seek to delete Personal Information or obtain copies of it. You may submit this information simultaneously with your initial request (by email) or after your request (as a second step). For requests of specific pieces of sensitive Personal Information about a consumer, we will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty; whereas for requests to know the categories of Personal Information collected and used about a consumer, we will verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty. We may give you options, such as (i) submitting a signed statement and a redacted copy of identifying information (such as a government-issued ID), or (ii) verifying your identity with a third party verification company that we may hire for this purpose. If we ask you to verify your identity, you must promptly cooperate with our efforts so that we can fulfill your request. If you do not comply, your request cannot be fulfilled; and if you delay in complying, the fulfillment of your request is likely to be delayed, and may be denied, as a result. If we cannot verify your identity, we will not be able to fully respond to your request. However, if we cannot verify you sufficiently to provide specific pieces, we will treat the request as a categories request, and if we cannot reasonably verify you for that, we will refer you to this Notice for our general practices. If we cannot sufficiently verify you as necessary for a deletion request, we will give you the opportunity to opt-out of sale.
If you are a California resident, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your request within 45 days. We may, however, extend the timeframe to total of 90 days, if an extension is reasonably necessary. We reserve the right to deny any request, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable law, but will explain the basis for that in our response to you. We will fulfill a right to know request from an individual up to two times in any twelve-month period. As permitted by California law, if a request is unduly burdensome or unfounded, we may reject it or condition further efforts on payment of reasonable costs. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request. Some Personal Information we maintain about consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough Personal Information about the consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular consumer’s Personal Information when a consumer request that requires verification pursuant to the verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). Accordingly, we do not include that Personal Information in response to those requests.
Consistent with California law and our interest in the security of your Personal Information, we will not deliver to you your driver’s license number or other government-issued id number, financial account number, any health or medical identification number, an account password, security questions or answers, or unique biometric data generated from measurements or technical analysis of human characteristics in response to a privacy rights request; however, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us.
Requests from Authorized Agents
California law permits an authorized agent to exercise any of the above California privacy rights on an individual’s behalf, subject to certain requirements. If you submit a request, other than opt-out of sale, on behalf of a consumer other than yourself, you will be required to demonstrate your legal authority to act on behalf of that person, and we may contact you and/or the consumer for verification purposes as permitted by California law. As permitted by California law, we may require that you provide information necessary to verify the identity of the person who is the subject of the request, or that such person verify his/her own identity directly with us before we fully respond to your request as an authorized agent. We reserve the right to deny requests, including an opt-out of sale request, where we reasonably suspect that the request is fraudulent. For the protection of our customers, we must receive all information requested and must verify an agent’s legal authority to our satisfaction consistent with what California law requires or permits before we can fulfill a request by an authorized agent.
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
California HR Data Subjects
California HR data subjects can learn more about our data practices as relates to them by contacting us via email at
usprivacy@puma.com
.
California Do Not Track Notice
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently is no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time. A DNT signal is not a global privacy control signal. For more information on global privacy control, see the
Exercising Your Rights
section above.

PUMA, and the PUMA group of companies (collectively, “PUMA” or "we", "us", or "our") respects the privacy of all of our visitors and pledges to provide you with the best online experience possible. This PUMA Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes what Personal Information (defined below) we collect from you via our Services (defined below), how we may use it and the steps we take to ensure that it is protected. This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information we may collect from you through any PUMA online services that posts this Privacy Policy, including our mobile app(s) for users located in the U.S. and Canada, as well as offline collection through our retail stores located in the U.S. and Canada, PUMA sponsored events, PUMA emails originated from the U.S. and Canada, and official PUMA operated surveys and sweepstakes entry forms, or in any other instance when you contact our operations in the U.S. and Canada (collectively “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to our job applicants or current or former employees or contractors except to the extent that they use our website and with regard to our biometric retention statement and with regard to how to make a privacy rights request.
BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, ON ANY COMPUTER, MOBILE PHONE, TABLET, CONSOLE OR OTHER PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC DEVICE (COLLECTIVELY, "DEVICE"), OR BY OTHER METHOD, YOU CONSENT TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY.
PUMA may modify this Privacy Policy at any time effective upon its posting, and additional privacy notices or policies may also apply. Your continued use of our products and services constitutes your acceptance to this Privacy Policy, applicable additional notices and policies and any updates. By using our Services, you agree to the Service’s
Terms & Conditions
governing the use of the Services and accept our practices as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Do not use the Service if you do not ACCEPT this Privacy Policy and AGREE TO the Terms and Conditions.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW
We collect information you give us or permit us to access. We may also collect information regarding your interaction with, and use of, our products and services. Information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, your name, image, birth date, email and physical address, when necessary credit card information, IP address, telephone number or mobile phone identifier, gender, contact lists, social media information, location (including GPS) information, activity and performance information, Device identifier and hardware information, browser type and language, cookie information, system type, whether you have enabled software to access certain features, access times, referring website URLs, information about your purchases and other information about your interactions with us.
For example, we collect information you provide via any of our customer service channels including via phone, email, SMS and chat, and such information and your communications may be monitored, recorded, disclosed, reviewed, accessed and used by us and our third party vendors to improve the quality of goods and services we provide and the quality of services provided by our third party vendors.
Additionally, some of our service providers and vendors including, without limitation, customer service vendors may utilize artificial intelligence (“AI”) to provide you with user-friendly and responsive feedback. In some instances, the AI utilized by these partners is based on algorithms that learn from existing data and other data that you and other users provide.
We also collect information about gift and eGift Card recipients provided by the giver.
As more fully explained in the next section, we may automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Services, or shop in our stores, including:
Log and Usage Information:
We collect information about your use of the Services, such as the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, items placed in your cart, links clicked, browsing behavior, and the referring URL (the webpage you visited before navigating to the Services). We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve our Services, to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience, and to personalize the Services, our communications with you, and your shopping experience.
Device Information:
We collect information about the device you use to access the Services, including the hardware model, IP address, unique device identifiers and operating system and version.
Transaction Information:
When you purchase or return a product, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details and the date and location of the purchase/return.
Video Data:
We use video cameras in our stores for security purposes, loss prevention, and asset protection. We may also use cameras in our stores for operational purposes, such as traffic pattern analysis. We will not use cameras to personally identify you, without your consent, except when the identification is for safety, security, anti-theft, or law enforcement purposes.
RFID Data:
We may use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) for inventory management and logistics support. RFID tags consist of a small chip and antenna that provide a unique identifier for objects. RFID serves the same purpose as a bar code and must be scanned by a specific type of reader in close proximity to the tag to retrieve tag data. RFID is not used to track or monitor any items once you leave our stores.
WiFi Data:
Some of our retail stores may offer free Wi-Fi services to visitors. Wi-Fi routers capture certain data, such as Device information and telemetry data related to signal strength and quality related to your use of our Wi-Fi service, and we may analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how customers move through our stores.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies:
As more fully explained in the next section, we (and our service providers and third parties) may use cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels") and other collection or tracking technologies (“Data Technologies”) to record and collect information about you when you interact with the Services, including information about your interaction with the Services such as mouse movements, click and keystroke behavior, indicated preferences, mobile app or site visit behavior, browsing and purchasing behavior. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving our websites and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our sites are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked and for other business purposes. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see the Cookies section below.
If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes that we sponsor, we may, in addition to the above, collect the information to administer the sweepstakes, or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection, such as your contact information, your product size information, your preferences, your location, and other information you provide to us.
Additionally, we may collect your mobile telephone number in connection with SMS/MMS programs, including for shipment notifications and marketing purposes. We will use mobile telephone information you provide through the Services to transmit your mobile messages and respond to you, if necessary. This includes, but is not limited to, disclosing information to platform providers, phone companies, and other vendors who assist us in the delivery of mobile messages. For more information regarding SMS/MMS programs, visit:
https://www.sinch.com/privacy-policy
.
We may also collect Personal Information in connection with the processing and evaluation of a job application and related materials submitted by you. For more information,
click here.
We may derive Personal Information or draw inferences about you based on the other types of Personal Information we collect. For example, we may infer location based on IP address, or make product recommendations based on browsing or purchasing behavior in connection with the Services.
We may combine information you give us with other information from PUMA sources, transactions and communications. This may include, but is not limited to, information from PUMA retail stores, direct mail, catalogs, promotions, collaborations, events, products and applications, or other PUMA interactions. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data from third parties. To the extent non-Service information is combined with Personal Information collected via the Services, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
COOKIES AND DATA TECHNOLOGIES
We, our service providers and third parties may use cookies and other Data Technologies, including but not limited to tracking pixels, to gather information about your visits on our website, mobile apps and other Services so we can enhance your experience. This information may be combined with other information, which will enable us to analyze and better customize your visits.
What Are Cookies? Cookies are data files stored within your browser when you interact with a website. These data files allow the website to recall important information about your visit, help better understand your preferences and improve your overall experience. For example, we use cookies to save products in your shopping cart while you browse our websites and to track the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns. Similarly, a tracking pixel or web beacon is a technology that can recognize specific cookies and convey information about that browser. We, and third parties, may also use technologies, such as our own, and third party, cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. Furthermore, when using Data Technologies from our advertising partners such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and others, we may use an “advanced matching” feature, in which data such as name, address, email address, telephone number, social media ID and browsing behavior is collected and shared with those partners in a pseudonymous manner in order to serve you advertising that is relevant to you based on your interactions with us. You can opt out of this collection and sharing by selecting Manage Cookies in the footer and opting out of
Social Media and Advertising
cookies or by adjusting your browser settings.
There are generally three categories of cookies used on the Services:
Functional:
These cookies are required for basic functionality and are therefore always enabled. If you disable them our Services may not function properly. These include cookies that allow you to be remembered as you explore and use our Services within a single session or, if you request, from session to session. They help make the shopping cart and checkout process possible as well as assist in security issues and conforming to regulations.
Performance and Analytics:
These cookies allow us to improve the Services' functionality by tracking usage, including through session replay. In some cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to remember Services preferences you have selected. These cookies also help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to all of our visitors and what promotions visitors like to see, and to gauge the success of our advertising campaigns. Refusing these cookies will limit recommendations and customizations while using the Services.
Social Media and Advertising:
Social media cookies offer the possibility to connect you to your social networks and share content from the Services through social media. Advertising cookies collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests. In some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your Personal Information. Refusing these cookies may result in seeing advertising that is not as relevant to you or you not being able to link effectively with Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks and/or not allowing you to share content on social media.
Your browser can also help you manage cookies. Most, but not all, browsers accept cookies automatically. You may be able to set your browser to reject and/or delete cookies. You may limit or turn off cookies and other collection tools by adjusting your browser settings. If you turn off certain collection tools, you may not have access to many features that make your experience more efficient and some of our services and features may not function properly. We recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so we can offer you a better shopping experience on our sites.
Some information about your use of the Services and certain other online services may be collected using Data Technologies across time and services and used by PUMA and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain other online services. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, PUMA currently does not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com
, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties may, however, offer you choices regarding their tracking technologies. PUMA is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third-party notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see below. We may, from time-to-time, and in certain jurisdictions, offer or point you to tools that allow you to exercise certain preferences regarding cookies and other Data Technologies associated with the Services, but such tools rely on third parties and third party information so we do not guaranty that the tools will provide complete and accurate information or be completely effective.
Some advertising and technology partners may also collect Personal Information when you use the Services. For example, we may work with other companies, such as Google, who use tracking technologies to analyze how users use the Services and to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. For more information about how data is collected and processed in connection with the Google Analytics service and how to opt out, visit
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
. To learn more about data Google collects and how your data may be used, and to optout of certain Google browser Interest-Based Advertising, please visit
http://www.google.com/settings/ads
.
Some third party Data Technology operators that may be associated with our Services may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
) (U.S.),
http://youradchoices.ca/choices
(Canada), and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g. from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g. mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. PUMA supports the ad industry’s
Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising
and expects that ad networks we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance.
USE OF INFORMATION
We may use your information subject to this Privacy Policy, including information that is defined as personal information, personally identifiable information or personal data under applicable laws (“Personal Information”) except as restricted by applicable law, including without limitation for:
Enhancing, personalizing and customizing user experiences, such as placing an order and other activities.
Communicating with you about your purchase, account information or customer service.
Analyzing user behavior and trends to better understand our customers and gain consumer insights.
Providing and conducting marketing and promotions.
Communicating with you about our products, services and events, and for other promotional purposes.
Administering contests, promotions, events, surveys or other features.
Displaying relevant marketing to you and other information about PUMA.

Transacting with you.
Improving the Service and for any other internal business purposes.
Preventing and addressing fraud, breach of policies or terms, and threats or harm.

We only send you text communications or promotional emails if you have opted to receive PUMA emails and/or SMS messages. If you no longer want to receive SMS messages, or promotional emails, or want to delete/update your Personal Information, please visit the
My Account
page or opt-out by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions in the message or by
Contacting Us
.
You can cancel text messages at any time. To stop receiving marketing text messages from PUMA, please reply “STOP” to the PUMA marketing text message. After you send "STOP", we may send you an additional text message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. You will no longer receive text messages from that short code, but you may receive text messages if you are subscribed to other text lists. If at any time you have questions about the text messages, text "HELP". After you send "HELP" we will respond with instructions on how to use our service as well as how to unsubscribe. Please note this preference will only apply to the phone number in receipt of the text. Message and data rates may apply.
PROTECTION AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION
PUMA uses technical and organizational measures designed to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, theft, and loss. While PUMA strives to protect its user's Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee 100% the security or confidentiality of any information that you provide to us or that is otherwise disclosed by you online. We recommend that you take additional measures to protect yourself and your information, such as installing anti-virus software, closing browsers after use, keeping confidential your log-in credentials and passwords. We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
We retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to provide our products and services to you and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, maintaining business and financial records, resolving disputes, maintaining security, detecting, and preventing fraud and abuse, and enforcing our agreements. The criteria used to determine retention periods includes the legal limitation of liability period, agreed contractual provisions, applicable regulatory requirements, and industry standards.
While we do not collect biometric data from the public, in instances where we collect employee biometric data, we only retain such biometric data for as long as necessary for the purpose of the collection of the biometric data and delete such biometric data when the purpose for collecting such data has been satisfied or within one year of the employee’s last interaction with the Company, whichever is earlier to occur.
DISCLOSING AND TRANSFERING OF INFORMATION
Subject to applicable law, this Privacy Policy and any representations made by us in writing at the time of collection, we may disclose your information except as restricted by applicable law. For instance, we may disclose your information, including Personal Information, with our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as to our partners, vendors, distributors, and suppliers, some of which may be outside the United States. We may transfer your information to certain service providers in order to conduct our business operations. For example, we may disclose your information to service providers who may provide the following services on our behalf: web hosting, credit card processing, shipping and order fulfillment, data management, email distribution, marketing, market research, analytics, customer service, website utilization, information analysis, and promotions management. We may also share some of your account details (such as your name, email address, password and date of birth) with our cloud service providers for the purposes of identification and authentication, so you can conveniently access your account. We may also disclose your information as is necessary to complete a transaction or provide a product, service, or feature that you have requested. These service providers will only use your information for the purpose of carrying out the services provided to PUMA. We may disclose information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property or safety. We may disclose information to prevent illegal uses of PUMA's products and services or violations of the
Terms & Conditions
, or applicable additional terms, or to defend ourselves against third party claims. We may also disclose information to companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information based upon your use of the Services.
Your information may be transferred to a third party as a part of our business assets in a sale of a part or all of PUMA, or in connection with a merger, financing or other corporate transaction.
You may also choose to disclose certain information publicly (e.g., when you post UGC) or with specific third parties (e.g., when you interact with third party Data Technologies or other services (e.g., social media plug-ins, links to other sites, etc.). When you use certain services, you agree to publicly share a basic amount of information, which may include your username, city location, and profile picture in accordance with the terms of those services. In order to participate in certain features, you may have to adjust your privacy settings and share additional information. You may also choose to disclose your activity on other platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Please read the privacy policies of those platforms, because your PUMA activity published on those platforms will no longer be governed by this Privacy Policy.
Our digital operations are conducted, in whole or in part, in the United States and our services are intended for U.S. users. Regardless of where you live, you consent to have your information, including Personal Information, transferred, processed and stored in the United States, and other jurisdictions, and allow PUMA to collect and process your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
CHILDRENS' PRIVACY
We do not knowingly collect or solicit “Personal Information” as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) (“Children’s Personal Information”) online from children under the age of 13. The Services are intended for a general audience. If we obtain knowledge that we have collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA we will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us as directed below in the “Contact Us” section.
THIRD PARTY SERVICES
The Services may include or link to third-party websites, apps, locations, platforms, code (e.g., plug-ins, application programming interfaces (“API”), and software development kits (“SDKs”)) or other third-party services. These third-party services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Data Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain third-party services, such as third party social networks (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a third-party service; “liking” or “sharing” PUMA content; logging in to the Service using your third-party service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a third-party service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other third-party services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the third-party service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with PUMA in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by PUMA. Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any third-party service.
We may engage and work with service providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on other online services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of precise location and/or cross-device data, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (“Interest-based Advertising”), which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”).
PUMA is not responsible for, and makes no representations regarding, the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics service providers and third-party services associated with the Services. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
OPT-OUT, DELETE OR MODIFY INFORMATION
You may cancel your Account or opt-out of receiving promotional e-mail messages from PUMA at any time. To unsubscribe and stop receiving SMS text or commercial e-mail communications from PUMA, you can change your Account settings or follow the instructions enclosed within the e-mail, text message, notification or other promotional message or communication. You can access, update, or correct certain information stored within your Account at any time by logging into your account and updating your preferences. However, this will only affect your account profile and not other Personal Information that we have about you. You may also request access, correction, or deletion of your personal information by contacting us as described in the
Contact Us

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE
Effective Date July, 2024
California law provides consumers (that are California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This California Privacy Rights Notice (“California Notice”) supplements the PUMA Privacy Policy. It applies solely to California consumers and addresses Personal Information we collect online and offline. This California Notice does not apply to PUMA employees or personnel, except with respect to how to exercise rights. This California Notice uses certain terms that have the meaning given to them in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020) and its implementing regulations.
Notice of Collection and Use of Personal Information
. We may collect (and may have collected during the 12-month period prior to the last updated date of this California Notice) the following categories of Personal Information about you:
Categories of Personal Information PUMA Has Collected in the Preceding 12 Months
Categories of Personal Information We Collected About California Consumers

such as signature, credit or debit card information, financial information;
Characteristics

There may be additional information that we collected that meets the definition of Personal Information under California law but is not reflected by a category, in which case we will treat it as Personal Information as required by California law, but will not include it when we are required to describe our practices by category of Personal Information.
As permitted by applicable law, we do not treat de-identified data or aggregate information as Personal Information and we reserve the right to convert or permit others to convert your Personal Information into de-identified or aggregate information. We have no obligation to re-identify such information or keep it longer than we need it for our own purposes.
Because there are numerous types of Personal Information in each category of Personal Information, and various uses for each Personal Information type, our retention periods vary for each of the categories of Personal Information described above. The length of time for which we retain each category of Personal Information depends on the purposes for our collection and use and requirements pursuant to applicable laws.

Protection and Retention of Information

Right to Correct
Right to Deletion
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing
Right to Nondiscrimination
Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Information
I. Right to Know.
If you are a consumer who resides in California you have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, a report that details the categories of Personal Information collected about you, the categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected, the purposes for collecting the Personal Information, the categories of Personal Information that we disclose for a business purpose, sell or share and the categories of third parties with whom the information is shared, and the specific pieces of Personal Information collected about you. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice.
II. Right to Correct
. If you are a consumer who resides in California you have the right to correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice.
III. Right to Deletion.
If you are a consumer who resides in California you have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, as explained below, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information, unless an exception applies. If an exception applies, we will inform you of that and limit retention and use to the permitted purpose. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice.
IV. Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.
If you are a customer who resides in California, you also have the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. While we do not sell (as “sell” is traditionally defined) your Personal Information to third parties, we do disclose information to third parties for advertising purposes which may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of “Personal Information” under California law for which you are entitled to opt-out. California residents may opt out of the “sale/share” of Personal Information by submitting a Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information (https://us.puma.com/us/en/do-not-sell-my-personal-information) request. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice. Note that you also can use the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) to signal your opt-out preference as explained in the
Exercising Your Rights
section below. We do not knowingly sell Personal Information of consumers under the age of 16.
V. Right to Nondiscrimination.
You have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights under California law.
Financial Incentives
We offer various financial incentives that might qualify as a “financial incentive” program under the CCPA. For example, we may provide discounts, coupons and other benefits for customers who sign up to receive our marketing emails. When you participate in a financial incentive, we may collect Personal Information from you, such as identifiers such as your name and email address and commercial information such as your purchase history. Participation in financial incentive program is optional for California consumers and any terms and conditions will be made available at the point of opt-in or in a confirming email. You can opt into a financial incentive by following the sign-up or participation instructions provided, and you have the ability to opt-out of the financial incentive, or our subsequent use of your Personal Information in connection with a financial incentive, at any time by contacting us as set out above, or as otherwise described in program terms, or by making a deletion request. If we condition the benefits on any limitation of your California privacy rights (e.g., you must consent to continued receipt of marketing to receive ongoing benefits), the benefits provided will be reasonably related to the value of the Personal Information provided, as will be more fully explained in the program terms. If you do not believe that the value you receive is reasonably related to the value of your applicable Personal Information, do not participate.
VI. Right to Limit the Use or Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
. Except with regard to our HR data subjects (i.e., California job applicants and current or former employees and independent contractors), we only process sensitive Personal Information for purposes that are exempt from choice under California law. If you are a HR data subject who resides in California, you may request PUMA limit sensitive Personal Information processing to certain purposes and if you do so we will explain in a response what processing purposes California law does not allow you to limit. To exercise your rights, please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section of this California Notice.
You may also obtain information on how to make, and may submit, a request by asking a manager at any of our California retail locations. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of the rights that are provided to you under California law.
Exercising Your Rights
To exercise your rights to know, delete, correct, and/or limit our processing of sensitive Personal Information, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Calling us at: 1-888-565-PUMA (7862) (tel:1-888-565-7862)
Submitting a
Customer Privacy Rights Request Form
Emailing us at:
consumerprivacy.us@puma.com
, or
Writing to us at:
PUMA
Attn: Privacy Officer
455 Grand Union Boulevard
Somerville MA, USA 02145
To exercise a Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information request:
Opt-out for non-cookie Personal Information
: To opt-out of the sale/sharing of your non-cookie Personal Information (e.g., your email address), you may make an opt-out request here (https://us.puma.com/us/en/do-not-sell-my-personal-information).
Opt-out for cookie Personal Information
: To opt-out of the sale/sharing of such Personal Information, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool by selecting the “
Cookie Settings
” link in the footer. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-out of cookie Personal Information and to non-cookie Personal Information. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device. You must exercise your preferences on each of our websites you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool. Beware that if you use ad blocking software, our cookie banner may not appear when you visit our services and you may have to use the link above to access the tool.
Use of Global Privacy Control
: Businesses are required to process global privacy control (“GPC”) signals, which is referred to in California as opt-out preference signals (“OOPS”), which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the sale and sharing of Personal Information. To use an OOPS/GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the OOPS/GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website. We process OOPS/GPC with respect to sales and sharing that may occur in the context of collection of cookie Personal Information by tracking technologies online by third-party digital businesses and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable OOPS/GPC. We currently do not, due to technical limitations, process OOPS/GPC for opt-outs of sales and sharing in other contexts (e.g., non-cookie Personal Information). We
do not
: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled OOPS/GPC; (2) change your experience with any product or service if you use OOPS/GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC. To learn more about the GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
.  If you delete cookies or reset your device, you may need to set your preference again to ensure we continue to honor your preferred choice.
You may also obtain information on how to make, and may submit, a request by asking a manager at any of our California retail locations.
Verifying and Fulfilling Requests
To protect your privacy and comply with the California law, and except in connection with a Do Not Sell/Share request, we will need to verify your request (i.e., verify you). The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information, and in the cases more sensitive or important Personal Information we require that be done to a high degree of certainty. We do this in a number of ways depending upon how we have interacted with you in the past, as more fully described in the next section. For security purposes, we will not collect sensitive Personal Information as part of the verification process. We do not use Personal Information you provide during verification for other purposes other than to keep a record of your request.
Describe your request with enough detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We may not be able to fully respond to your right to know, deletion, or correction requests if we cannot verify your identity consistent with the standards for verification and security and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. Once we receive your request, we are required to verify that you are the person that is the subject of the request, or an authorized agent property acting on behalf of a specific consumer. How we do this will depend on the content of the consumer relationship with us and the sensitivity of the Personal Information. Typically, this consists of matching identifying information provided by you with the information we have about you in our records.
Upon making a request, you will be asked to provide your
full name, e-mail address, shipping address and telephone number
. Providing accurate information that matches our records is necessary so that we can locate the correct information within our systems and among our service providers. To verify your request, we may ask you to submit evidence beyond your basic Personal Information in order to prove your identity, especially if you seek to delete Personal Information or obtain copies of it. You may submit this information simultaneously with your initial request (by email) or after your request (as a second step). For requests of specific pieces of sensitive Personal Information about a consumer, we will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty; whereas for requests to know the categories of Personal Information collected and used about a consumer, we will verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty. We may give you options, such as (i) submitting a signed statement and a redacted copy of identifying information (such as a government-issued ID), or (ii) verifying your identity with a third party verification company that we may hire for this purpose. If we ask you to verify your identity, you must promptly cooperate with our efforts so that we can fulfill your request. If you do not comply, your request cannot be fulfilled; and if you delay in complying, the fulfillment of your request is likely to be delayed, and may be denied, as a result. If we cannot verify your identity, we will not be able to fully respond to your request. However, if we cannot verify you sufficiently to provide specific pieces, we will treat the request as a categories request, and if we cannot reasonably verify you for that, we will refer you to this Notice for our general practices. If we cannot sufficiently verify you as necessary for a deletion request, we will give you the opportunity to opt-out of sale.
If you are a California resident, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your request within 45 days. We may, however, extend the timeframe to total of 90 days, if an extension is reasonably necessary. We reserve the right to deny any request, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable law, but will explain the basis for that in our response to you. We will fulfill a right to know request from an individual up to two times in any twelve-month period. As permitted by California law, if a request is unduly burdensome or unfounded, we may reject it or condition further efforts on payment of reasonable costs. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request. Some Personal Information we maintain about consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough Personal Information about the consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular consumer’s Personal Information when a consumer request that requires verification pursuant to the verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). Accordingly, we do not include that Personal Information in response to those requests.
Consistent with California law and our interest in the security of your Personal Information, we will not deliver to you your driver’s license number or other government-issued id number, financial account number, any health or medical identification number, an account password, security questions or answers, or unique biometric data generated from measurements or technical analysis of human characteristics in response to a privacy rights request; however, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us.
Requests from Authorized Agents
California law permits an authorized agent to exercise any of the above California privacy rights on an individual’s behalf, subject to certain requirements. If you submit a request, other than opt-out of sale, on behalf of a consumer other than yourself, you will be required to demonstrate your legal authority to act on behalf of that person, and we may contact you and/or the consumer for verification purposes as permitted by California law. As permitted by California law, we may require that you provide information necessary to verify the identity of the person who is the subject of the request, or that such person verify his/her own identity directly with us before we fully respond to your request as an authorized agent. We reserve the right to deny requests, including an opt-out of sale request, where we reasonably suspect that the request is fraudulent. For the protection of our customers, we must receive all information requested and must verify an agent’s legal authority to our satisfaction consistent with what California law requires or permits before we can fulfill a request by an authorized agent.
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
California HR Data Subjects
California HR data subjects can learn more about our data practices as relates to them by contacting us via email at
usprivacy@puma.com
.
California Do Not Track Notice
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently is no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time. A DNT signal is not a global privacy control signal. For more information on global privacy control, see the
Exercising Your Rights
section above.
California’s Shine the Light law
If you are a California resident, you are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of Personal Information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.

If you would like to submit a review for one of our products, we will process your email address, your nickname and also the content of your review (e.g. reviewed product, star rating, title and text of review, recommendation). Your email address will be processed in order to verify and establish your identity. It may also be used by our customer service in order to reply to your feedback by email. If, before submitting your review, you have given your consent, we will send you an email notification when your review is published. Since your (star) rating and the content of your review will be published alongside your nickname on our websites, please ensure that you do not give any personal information in this.
This data processing is necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interest, namely customer service and recommendation marketing (Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. f GDPR). Email notifications about the publication of the review are based on your prior consent (Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. a GDPR).
2.4. Registration and setting up a customer account
When you visit our websites, you can create a customer account. The registration for a customer account requires you to provide personal data. Mandatory fields are marked accordingly in the in-put form.
This data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract (provision of a customer ac-count) with you (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. b GDPR).
2.5. Data processing in the case of orders in the online shop
In addition, we process your personal data in connection with the purchase of goods in our online shop.
2.5.1. Purchase and payment of goods in the online shop
We process your personal data (i.a. contact details, shipping and payment information) if you purchase goods in the online shop. If you purchase goods for another person (third party), we process the personal data of the third party provided by you (name and any contact details) for the dispatch of the goods to the third party. Please ensure that the third party has been sufficiently informed by you about the processing of their data at PUMA, and that you are authorised to provide such data.
This data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. b GDPR).

2.5.3. Fraud and credit check
Before concluding the purchase contract, we carry out a fraud and credit check. This is done to enable us to offer you a choice of different payment methods and at the same time to protect ourselves against the default of payment of the invoice. As part of the credit check, we i.a. check all previously made orders in your customer account. It is also checked whether the delivery address differs from the billing address, whether the delivery address is new or if the order should be delivered to a pack station. For orders made in
Germany
,
Austria
,
Switzerland
and the
Netherlands
, we also obtain a credit report during our credit check. The credit report can contain, firstly, information about any current payment delinquencies, e. g. from public debtor registers, or data from court collection proceedings. Secondly, the credit check can also list so-called score values, which are calculated based on a scientifically recognised mathematical and statistical procedure and are used to assess the credit risk. The credit rating agency also uses the above data for other enterpris-es (e.g. other online traders) for the purposes of checking addresses and/or identity checks, and for any scoring applications based on these. Your address data is also included in the probability values.
If you do not agree with the payment method(s) you have been offered, you can contest the deci-sion stating your point of view either by letter or by sending an email to service-uk@puma.com. We will then check the decision taken once again, in consideration of your point of view.
In addition to that we will check, based on your device on pre-defined rules, if the order should be categorised as being suspected of fraud. If there is any suspicion of fraud, we will additionally carry out an individual check on the order. The result of this manual fraud check can either be positive, which would lead to the order being approved. If, however, the suspicion of fraud remains, we may decide to cancel the order, depending on the particular case.
This data processing necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interest to avoid default of pay-ment and fraud (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. f GDPR).
2.5.4. Cancellation of purchase
In any case of cancellation of the purchase (e.g. withdrawal of contract) we will process your per-sonal data for returning the goods and refunding the purchase price.
This data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. b GDPR) and/or for compliance with a legal obligation (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sen-tence 1, lit. b GDPR lit. c GDPR).
2.5.5. Invitation emails for product rating and review
We would like to know if you are satisfied with your purchased PUMA goods. For this purpose, we process your email and purchasing data (e.g. goods purchased and date of purchase), in order to send you an email within one month after the purchase, inviting you to rate and review your purchased product (further information on data processing in connection with the submission of prod-uct reviews can be found in Section 2.3).
This data processing is necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interest in good customer ser-vice and marketing.
Objection to product rating and review invitation emails:
You can object to the receipt of such invitation emails from the start, by clicking on the opt-out but-ton under the following link:
https://www.bazaarvoice.com/legal/privacy-policy/#opting-out
In this case a persistent opt-out cookie (name: “NoCookie[EU]”) is set in your current used brows-er, that prevents your data from being processed for invitation emails when using this specific browser. If you use another browser, data transfer to Bazaarvoice will be in principle enabled, unless the opt-out cookie is also set in this browser. Please note, that data transfer to Bazaarvoice will be enabled again, if you delete the abovementioned opt-out cookie in your browser.
If you have already received an email inviting you to evaluate the product, you can decline the fu-ture receipt of such emails by clicking on the opt-out button/link contained in each invitation email.
2.5.6. Dunning process, collection and enforcement and/or defence of legal claims
In the case of outstanding amounts owed to us, we will advise you accordingly by email, SMS, letter or by phone, and under certain circumstances, will send you a dunning letter. If and to the extent that you still fail to make the payment, we will initiate a credit collection procedure.
The credit collection procedure will be carried out by a credit collection agency engaged by us. If necessary to carry out the credit collection procedure, the credit collection agency will carry out address enquiries, thereby availing itself of public registers in order to locate you as a debtor.
In the case of a legal dispute with you, we will process your personal data to enforce and/or defend our rights. If and to the extent necessary for the legal dispute, we will thereby rely also on data from other sources (e.g. public registers).
This data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. b GDPR) as well as for the purpose of our legitimate interest in preventing the abuse of our services and in establishment and exercise of legal claims (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. f GDPR).
2.6. Other processing
2.6.1. Performance of internal audits
Within the scope of audits within the PUMA Group, both at home and abroad, your personal data may be processed. During this process, we rely also on data from other sources, depending on the case (e.g. credit agencies).
Your data may, under certain circumstances, also be appropriately processed in order to identify and rectify misconduct within the enterprise, and to implement compliance programmes and com-pliance measures.
This data processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations (e.g. under the Stock Company Act) (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, lit. c GDPR) and/or for the purpose of our legiti-mate interest to check the processes and efficiency in the PUMA Group, to rectify misconduct and cases of fraud, to enforce and/or defend our rights, as the case may be, and to uncover any crimi-nal offences, (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. f GDPR).
2.6.2. Issuing of analyses
On the basis of your data, which we process the meaning of Section 2 of this Data Protection Infor-mation, we may issue analyses. These serve as a basis for our business decisions, to improve our products and services, to adapt to the needs of our customers and to carry out marketing activities. The analyses issued on this basis no longer have any personal reference, which means it is no long-er possible to trace them back to you.
This data processing is necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interest to improve the products and services we offer and carry out marketing activities (Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1, lit. f GDPR).
2.6.3. Prize Competitions & Raffles
PUMA offers you the chance to participate in prize competitions and raffles on this Website, as well as in our stores, on Social Media like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, with our Affiliate Partners, in Newsletters, or similar.
Your personal data will be processed with your participation. In all our prize competitions and raffles, you only need to provide us with the data that we require to perform the raffle and to notify you of your win. Typically, this is your email address, but additional data might be required based on the applicable terms and conditions of certain raffles.
If the raffle is about winning PUMA Sportswear (clothes and shoes), we ask for your name, your clothing or shoe size and your gender in addition to your email address. In order to be able to collect the prize from us, we may also ask you to inform us of the store of your choice, where you can pick up your prize by giving your name. If the prize is sent by post, which can be in case you can win tickets, vouchers or other non-cash prizes, we need your home address in addition to your name. In some cases, we might additionally ask for your age to ensure that you can legally participate in the raffle based on the applicable terms and conditions. You will find further information on all this in the terms and conditions that apply.
The data required by us to perform the raffle under the applicable terms and conditions are highlighted as mandatory fields. Unfortunately, participation in the raffle is not possible without entering your data in the marked mandatory fields. Other, unmarked fields, however, are optional and you decide yourself whether you want to share further data with us. Participation in the raffle does not depend of your optional data and has no effect on the performance of the raffle.
In the event of your participation, we process the data you provide to us in the raffle solely for the purpose of performing the raffle and notifying the winner. The same applies if you provide us with data based on terms and conditions for raffles on social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, ...), e.g. by uploading a photo or posting articles, linking hashtags, using handles or commenting on our campaigns. The applicable terms and conditions may stipulate that we publish your name and address on our social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, ...) to announce you as a winner and your prize.
Please note, that your data will be deleted after the raffle.
Within the scope of our raffles you also have the opportunity to give us your consent to the use of your data for advertising. Your consent to advertising has no effect on your participation in the raffle. If you give us your consent to receive advertising, such as newsletters per email, usually by ticking a checkbox, we will process your data, especially your email address, also to send you offers and information about our products by email. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Further information on data processing when receiving our newsletter can be found under the section “Newsletter”.
We process your personal data based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR and, where applicable, to fulfil a legal obligation in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit c GDPR.

In individual cases we are supported by external service providers with whom we have concluded a corresponding agreement to ensure the security of the processed data.
Of course, you can exercise the rights to which you are entitled under data protection law against us at any time. You will find more detailed information on this under the section “Your Rights”.
