The parent will be required to follow the instructions detailed in the verification email and activate the Account within the period defined therein (“Pending Period”). In the event the parent does not activate the Account within the Pending Period, the Account will be blocked until the parent either requests to resend the verification email and subsequently activates the account, or chooses to proceed solely as a guest (meaning, some features will not be available). In this latter case, the parent account and all child profiles under the parent account will be removed from the KIDOZ database and all user activity information previously collected will be deleted and no additional data will be collected for that user.

Kidoz and GDPR-K Compliance:
Safeguarding Children's Digital Privacy
At Kidoz, we recognize the paramount importance of protecting children’s privacy in the digital world. This white paper outlines our commitment and comprehensive approach to ensuring full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly its provisions for children (GDPR-K). Through our technology, stringent policies, and transparent practices, Kidoz not only meets but exceeds the requirements set forth to safeguard children’s personal data.
Background
The digital landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities, particularly when it comes to advertising to children. Compliance with GDPR-K and COPPA is not just a regulatory requirement but a cornerstone of trust between families, brands, and content publishers. Kidoz has risen to this challenge, creating a contextual mobile advertising network that respects privacy while enabling sustainable revenue for app developers.
About Kidoz
Kidoz is a leading provider of child-safe digital advertising solutions. Recognizing the vulnerability of children in the digital ecosystem, we have embedded privacy and safety into the DNA of our services, ensuring a secure and positive online experience for our young users.
Key Provisions and Kidz's Alignment
GDPR-K emphasizes several critical areas: the age of digital consent, data minimization, privacy by design, clear communication, and strict limits on data sharing and marketing. Kidoz adheres to these principles, implementing robust measures to comply with each requirement.
Kidoz's Approach to GDPR-K Compliance
Data Privacy and Protection Policies
Kidoz has developed comprehensive data protection policies that govern every aspect of our operations. From data collection to processing and sharing, we ensure the highest standards of privacy and security. Our policies are regularly reviewed and audited by an official certifier, PRIVO.
‍
Please find a case study, written by PRIVO about our effort regarding GDPR-K:
https://www.privo.com/kidoz-case-study
Consent Verification
In addressing the essential considerations surrounding the age of digital consent under GDPR-K, Kidoz adopts a universally cautious approach, operating on the principle that
ALL users
within our network are treated as if they are below the age of digital consent.
This policy underscores our steadfast commitment to privacy and safety, ensuring that no personal data is ever shared with third parties.
When responding to advertising requests, Kidoz meticulously removes any personally identifiable information (PII) from the transaction. This rigorous process ensures that every ad served through our network is entirely devoid of personal data, upholding our promise to safeguard user privacy at every turn. By default, we operate with the highest standards of data protection, effectively ensuring that our user base is shielded from any form of data sharing that could compromise their privacy.
Privacy by Design
From the initial stages of product development to each subsequent update, Kidoz integrates privacy by design principles. This approach means that every new feature, service, or product we develop undergoes rigorous privacy impact assessments to identify and mitigate risks to children's data privacy. Our engineering teams are trained to prioritize privacy, ensuring that the default settings for all our services are always set to the highest level of data protection.
Kidoz's Commitment to Clearly Labeled Advertising
Kidoz takes a transparent approach to advertising by distinctly labeling our ads, ensuring they are easily recognized as advertisements and not mistaken for content. This practice is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of our user experience, fostering trust among children, parents, and content publishers alike. By incorporating a clear, consistent watermark across all our advertisements, Kidoz guarantees that users can effortlessly distinguish between entertainment or educational content and promotional material
Ad Platform Innovation
In our pursuit of setting industry benchmarks for responsible and child-friendly digital advertising, Kidoz not only rigorously ensured its advertising platform met stricter GDPR-K compliance standards but also implemented an exhaustive manual review process.
Every campaign and ad creative submitted to our network is meticulously examined by our dedicated in-house team
. This hands-on approach ensures that all advertisements are not only relevant and appropriate for our young audience but also fully compliant with the strictest privacy standards.
Following this manual filtration our system is intricately designed to automatically
filter out any campaign or ad creative that could potentially collect personal information
, such as names, birth dates, email addresses, or locations. This comprehensive review process ensures all advertisements are relevant, appropriate for our young audience, and strictly adhere to privacy regulations. By integrating this dual-layered approach—combining automated safeguards with human oversight—Kidoz underscores its unwavering commitment to creating a secure and nurturing digital environment, completely free of privacy concerns.
COPPA and GDPRkids™ Compliance
In our dedication to exceed the standard requirements for children's online privacy, the Kidoz team has proactively sought and attained oversight from an FTC-approved
COPPA Safe Harbor
through
PRIVO
, affirming our platform's compliance with the stringent measures designed to protect children aged 13 and under.
Furthering our commitment to global privacy standards, Kidoz has also become a proud participant in

5.
Controller SCCs
5.1
Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Customer.
To the extent
                    that:
(a)
Google transfers European Controller Personal Data to Customer; and
(b)
the transfer is a Restricted European Transfer, Customer as data importer will be deemed
                      to have entered into the Controller SCCs with Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End
                      Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs.
5.2
Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Customer
. To the extent that:
(a)
Google transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Customer; and
(b)
the transfer is a Restricted European Transfer,
                      Customer as data importer will be deemed to have entered into the Controller SCCs with Google LLC (the
                      applicable Google End Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Controller
                      SCCs.
5.3
Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Google
. The parties
                    acknowledge that to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to Google, the
                    Controller SCCs are not required because the address of Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End
                    Controller) is in an Adequate Country and such transfers are Permitted European Transfers. This does not
                    affect Google’s obligations under paragraph 4.1 (Restricted European Transfers) of this Appendix 1A.
5.4
Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google.
To the extent that
                    Customer transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Google, Customer as data exporter will be deemed to have
                    entered into the Controller SCCs with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data importer and
                    the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs, because Google LLC’s address is not in an Adequate
                    Country.
5.5
Contacting Google; Customer Information
.
(a)
Customer may contact Google Ireland Limited and/or Google LLC in connection with the
                      Controller SCCs at
https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584
or through
                      such other means as may be provided by Google from time to time.
(b)
Customer acknowledges that Google is required under the Controller SCCs to record
                      certain information, including (i) the identity and contact details of the data importer (including any
                      contact person with responsibility for data protection); and (ii) the technical and organisational
                      measures implemented by the data importer. Accordingly, Customer will, where requested and as applicable
                      to Customer, provide such information to Google via such means as may be provided by Google, and will
                      ensure that all information provided is kept accurate and up-to-date.
5.6
Responding to Data Subject Enquiries
. The applicable data importer will be
                    responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the supervisory authority concerning the
                    processing of applicable Controller Personal Data by the data importer.
5.7
Data Deletion on Termination
. To the extent that:
(a)
Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Controller
                      SCCs; and
(b)
Customer terminates the Agreement in accordance with Clause 16(c) of the Controller
                      SCCs, then for the purposes of Clause 16(d) of the Controller SCCs, Customer directs Google to delete
                      Controller Personal Data, and, unless European Laws require storage, Google will facilitate such
                      deletion as soon as is reasonably practicable, to the extent such deletion is reasonably possible
                      (taking into account that Google is an independent Controller of such data, as well as the nature and
                      functionality of the Controller Services).
6.
Liability if Controller SCCs Apply.
If Controller SCCs apply under paragraph 5 (Controller SCCs) of this Appendix 1A, then the total combined
                  liability of:
(a)
Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited towards Customer; and
(b)
Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited,
                    under or in connection with the Agreement and the Controller SCCs combined will be subject to Section 5
                    (Liability). Clause 12 of the Controller SCCs will not affect the previous sentence.
7.
Third-Party Beneficiaries
Where Google LLC and/or Google Ireland Limited are not a party to the Agreement but are a party to the
                  applicable Controller SCCs in accordance with paragraph 5 (Controller SCCs) of this Appendix 1A, Google LLC
                  and/or Google Ireland Limited (as applicable) will be a third-party beneficiary of Section 4.3 (End Controllers)
                  and paragraphs 3 (Google End Controllers), 5 (Controller SCCs) and 6 (Liability if Controller SCCs Apply) of
                  this Appendix 1A. To the extent this paragraph 7 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) conflicts or is inconsistent with
                  any other clause in the Agreement, this paragraph 7 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) will apply.
8.
Precedence
8.1
If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Controller SCCs, this Appendix 1A, the
                    remainder of these Controller Terms and/or the remainder of the Agreement, then the Controller SCCs will
                    prevail.
8.2
Additional Commercial Clauses
. Subject to the amendments in these
                    Controller Terms, the Agreement remains in full force and effect. Paragraphs 5.5 (Contacting Google) to 5.7
                    (Data Deletion on Termination), and paragraph 6 (Liability if Controller SCCs Apply) of this Appendix 1A are
                    additional commercial clauses relating to the Controller SCCs as permitted by Clause 2(a) (Effect and
                    invariability of the Clauses) of the Controller SCCs.
8.3
No Modification of Controller SCCs
. Nothing in the Agreement (including
                    these Controller Terms) is intended to modify or contradict any Controller SCCs or prejudice the fundamental

Google’s Security Measures and Assistance.
(a)
Google’s Security Measures.
Google will implement and maintain
                        technical and organizational measures to protect Customer Personal Data against accidental or
                        unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access (“
Security
                          Measures
”). The Security Measures include measures: (i) to encrypt personal data; (ii)
                        to help ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Google’s
                        systems and services; (iii) to help restore timely access to personal data following an incident;
                        and (iv) for regular testing of effectiveness. Google may update or modify the Security Measures
                        from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of
                        the overall security of the Customer Personal Data.
(b)
Access and Compliance.
Google will ensure that all persons
                        authorized to process Customer Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are
                        under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
(c)
Google’s Security Assistance.
Google will (taking into account the
                        nature of the processing of Customer Personal Data and the information available to Google) assist
                        Customer in meeting Customer’s (or, where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s)
                        obligations in respect of security of personal data and personal data breaches, including Customer’s
                        (or, where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s) obligations relating to security of
                        personal data and personal data breaches under the US State Privacy Laws, by:
(i)
implementing and maintaining the Security Measures in accordance with paragraph
                          3.3.1(a) (Google’s Security Measures);
(ii)
complying with the terms of paragraph 3.3.2 (Data Incidents); and
(iii)
providing Customer with the rights granted under paragraph 3.3.3(c)
                          (Customer’s Audit Rights).
3.3.2
Data Incidents.
(a)
Incident Notification.
If Google becomes aware of a Data Incident
                        (as defined below), Google will: (i) notify Customer of the Data Incident without undue delay; and
                        (ii) promptly take reasonable steps to minimize harm and secure Customer Personal Data. In this
                        Appendix 1B, “
Data Incident
” means a breach of Google’s security leading to the
                        accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to,
                        Customer Personal Data on systems managed by or otherwise controlled by Google. “Data Incidents”
                        will not include unsuccessful attempts or activities that do not compromise the security of Customer
                        Personal Data, including unsuccessful log-in attempts, pings, port scans, denial of service attacks,
                        and other network attacks on firewalls or networked systems.
(b)
Delivery of Notification.
Google will deliver its notification of
                        any Data Incident to the email address designated by Customer, via the user interface of the RDP
                        Services or such other means provided by Google, to receive certain notifications from Google
                        relating to this Appendix 1B (“
Notification Email Address
”) or, at Google’s
                        discretion (including if Customer has not provided a Notification Email Address), by other direct
                        communication (for example, phone call, email, or an in-person meeting). Customer is solely
                        responsible for providing the Notification Email Address and ensuring that the Notification Email
                        Address is current and valid.
(c)
Third Party Notifications.
Customer is solely responsible for complying with incident notification laws
                        applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Data
                        Incident.
(d)
No Acknowledgement of Fault by Google.
Google’s notification of or response to a Data Incident under this paragraph 3.3.2
                        (Data Incidents) will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Google of any fault or liability
                        with respect to the Data Incident.
3.3.3
Customer’s Security Responsibilities and Assessment.
(a)
Customer’s Security Responsibilities.
Customer agrees that, without
                        prejudice to Google’s obligations under paragraphs 3.3.1 (Google’s Security Measures and Assistance)
                        and 3.3.2 (Data Incidents):
(i)
Customer is responsible for its use of the RDP Services, including: (1) making
                          appropriate use of the RDP Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in
                          respect of Customer Personal Data; and (2) securing the account authentication credentials,
                          systems and devices Customer uses to access the RDP Services; and
(ii)
Google has no obligation to protect Customer Personal Data that Customer elects
                          to store or transfer outside of Google’s and its subcontractors’ systems.
(b)
Customer’s Security Assessment.
Customer acknowledges and agrees
                        that the Security Measures implemented and maintained by Google as set out in paragraph 3.3.1(a)
                        (Google’s Security Measures) provide a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of
                        Customer Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and
                        the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of Customer Personal Data as well as the
                        risks to individuals.
(c)
Customer’s Audit Rights.
(i)
Customer may conduct an audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations
                          under this Appendix 1B by requesting and reviewing (1) a certificate issued for security
                          verification reflecting the outcome of an audit conducted by a third party auditor (e.g., SOC 2
                          Type II or ISO/IEC 27001 certification or a comparable certification or other security
                          certification of an audit conducted by a third-party auditor agreed by Customer and Google)
                          within 12 months as of the date of Customer’s request and (2) any other information Google
                          determines is reasonably necessary for Customer to verify such compliance.
(ii)
Alternatively, Google may, at its sole discretion and in response to a request
                          by Customer, initiate a third-party audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations
                          under this Appendix 1B. During such an audit, Google will make available to the third-party
                          auditor all information necessary to demonstrate such compliance. Where Customer requests such
                          an audit, Google may charge a fee (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any audit. Google
                          will provide Customer with further details of any applicable fee, and the basis of its
                          calculation, in advance of any such audit. Customer will be responsible for any fees charged by
                          any third-party auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such audit.
(iii)
Nothing in this Appendix 1B will require Google either to disclose to Customer
                          or its third-party auditor, or to allow Customer or its third-party auditor to access:
(1)
any data of any other customer of a Google Entity;
(2)
any Google Entity’s internal accounting or financial information;
(3)
any trade secret of a Google Entity;
(4)
any information that, in Google's reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise
                            the security of any Google Entity’s systems or premises; or (B) cause any Google Entity to
                            breach its obligations under the US State Privacy Laws or its security and/or privacy
                            obligations to Customer or any third party; or
(5)
any information that Customer or its third party auditor seeks to access for
                            any reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer’s obligations under the US
                            State Privacy Laws.
3.4
Assistance with Impact Assessments.
Google will (taking into account the
                    nature of the processing and the information available to Google) assist Customer in meeting Customer’s (or,
                    where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s) obligations relating to data protection impact
                    assessments and prior regulatory consultations to the extent required under the US State Privacy Laws by:
(a)
providing the Security Documentation;
(b)
providing the information contained in the Agreement (including this Appendix 1B); and
(c)
providing or otherwise making available, in accordance with Google’s standard
                      practices, other materials concerning the nature of the RDP Services and the processing of Customer
                      Personal Data (for example, help center materials).
3.5
Data Subject Rights.
3.5.1
Responses to Data Subject Requests.
If Google receives a request from
                      a data subject in relation to Customer Personal Data, Customer authorizes Google to, and Google hereby
                      notifies Customer that it will:
(a)
respond directly to the data subject’s request in accordance with the standard
                        functionality of a tool (if any) made available by a Google Entity to data subjects that enables
                        Google to respond directly and in a standardized manner to certain requests from data subjects in
                        relation to Customer Personal Data (for example, online advertising settings or an opt-out browser
                        plugin) (“
Data Subject Tool
”) (if the request is made via a Data Subject Tool); or
(b)
advise the data subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be
                        responsible for responding to such request (if the request is not made via a Data Subject Tool).
3.5.2
Google’s Data Subject Request Assistance.
Google will assist Customer
                      in fulfilling its (or, where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s) obligations under the
                      US State Privacy Laws to respond to requests for exercising the data subject’s rights, in all cases
                      taking into account the nature of the processing of Customer Personal Data and by:

3.6
Subcontractors.
(a)
Customer generally authorizes Google to engage other entities as subcontractors in
                      connection with the provision of the RDP Services. When engaging any subcontractor, Google will:
(i)
ensure via a written contract that: (1) the subcontractor only accesses and uses
                        Customer Personal Data to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it, and
                        does so in accordance with the Agreement (including this Appendix 1B); and (2) if the processing of
                        Customer Personal Data is subject to the US State Privacy Laws, ensure that the data protection
                        obligations in this Appendix 1B are imposed on the subcontractor;
(ii)
when engaging any new subcontractors, provide notice of such new subcontractors
                        where required by US State Privacy Laws, and, where required by US State Privacy Laws, further
                        provide an opportunity for Customer to object to such subcontractors; and
(iii)
remain fully liable for all obligations subcontracted to, and all acts and
                        omissions of, the subcontractor.
(b)
Customer may object to any new subcontractor by terminating the Agreement for
                      convenience immediately upon written notice to Google, on condition that Customer provides such notice
                      within 90 days of being informed of the engagement of the new subcontractor as described in paragraph
                      3.6(a)(ii) herein.
