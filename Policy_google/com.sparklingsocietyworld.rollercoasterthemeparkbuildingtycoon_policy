We use Accountprofiles for performing marketing activities, to show ads that match personal preferences and interests and to keep track of which ads you’ve already seen.
On what basis do we process your data?
We are not permitted to simply request or use your data. The regulations state that we may only do so if there is ‘a basis for processing’. This means that we may use your data for one or more of the following reasons:
Executing the agreement
We need data in order to conclude an agreement, for example if you download a game you conclude an agreement with us.
Legitimate interests
We may use your data in connection with our ‘legitimate interests’, for example for sending certain messages and/or to inform you about other games and for improving security, preventing fraud and cheating. However, we have to be able to demonstrate that our interests in the use of your data outweigh your right to privacy. We therefore carefully weigh up all of the interests.
Consent
We process your data based on the consent that you have given, for example for sending newsletters. You may revoke this consent at any time. Beside we build an Accountprofile using the data and information that you provide to us.
Kids
You need to have a certain age to play our games. Players up to 16 years old are considered as kids and do not belong to our target group. If kids do play our games with the permission of their parents or guardians, we will treat them with extra care and will not send interest-based ads.
Security of your data
We do our utmost to keep your data secure. Among other things, we have taken the following technological and organisational measures for dealing with your personal data:
We have secured our systems, and we continue to invest in our systems, procedures and people.

Other data
– we only keep other personal data for as long as it is required for the purposes for which it was intended. We delete personal data as soon as it is no longer needed for the purposes for which we process it.
Do we share your personal data with third parties?
We use service providers who carry out work for us and process your data. We only provide them with the personal data necessary for them to perform the services, such as sending newsletters via e-mail. We select these companies carefully and conclude processing agreements with these parties. These processing agreements stipulate what these parties may do with personal data, how they must secure the data and when the data must be deleted.
Do personal data go to countries outside the EEA (European Economic Area)?
Personal data which we receive from you can in some cases be passed to countries outside the EEA. In principle we only pass personal data to countries with an appropriate protection level. In case there is not an appropriate protection level we take care of appropriated safeguards. Such as concluding model contracts that are approved by the European Commission.

This is possible, but only if we process your data on the basis of consent, or on the basis of the agreement that we have concluded with you. This is called ‘data portability’.
