Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled by the
Student Calendar
, app made available through Google Play Store.
Where is the data stored?
The app does not need an internet connection to achieve its main goals. Data entered directly by the user is only stored on the device.
The app has functionality that allows you to perform backups and store them in Google Drive in an automated way. Thus, if the user chooses to use this functionality, backups with all application data will be stored in the Google Drive chosen by the user.
The app accesses and uses Google user data only for authentication and use of Google services. This data is only stored on the user's own device and is not shared with third parties.
The use of Google data is limited to the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy. The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
What data is collected?
Some anonymous data is required for Google Admob to work (Google's platform for advertising in apps). The following anonymous data are collected by Google Admob: clicks and number of views of the ads, Android advertising ID, IP address, performance, execution, failures and battery usage by the app.
When you send us an email, the app attaches to the email information about the app settings, language, Android version, screen size, device brand and device model, in order to have information for support.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may modify or revise our Privacy Policy from time to time to adapt to new features or changes. When important changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will let you know through the app.
