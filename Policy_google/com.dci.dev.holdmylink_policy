Why LaterLinks Requests Google Drive Access
LaterLinks offers
syncing capabilities
with Google Drive, allowing you to access your saved links from
      different devices. Here’s why:
Cross-Device Access:
Your links are saved in a secure file on your Google Drive, so they are
        available on all devices linked to your Google account.
Backup & Restore:
If you switch devices or reinstall the app, your saved links will be
        automatically restored.
Important:
LaterLinks only accesses the folder it creates in your Google Drive. It does
not
access any other files or folders. You can also revoke access at any time from
      your Google account
      settings.

Privacy Policy
Welcome to
LaterLinks
! Your privacy is important to us. This page outlines what
      data we collect, how it is used, and our commitment to protecting your information.
Data Collection and Usage
LaterLinks
does not collect, store, or process any personal data. All saved links are stored
      locally on your device unless you enable Google Drive sync.
Google Drive Integration
LaterLinks offers **optional** Google Drive integration to sync saved links across devices. Here’s how it works:
A dedicated folder is created in your **Google Drive**.
Your saved links are stored in a CSV file within this folder.
Only LaterLinks has access to this specific folder—**no other files on your Google Drive are accessed**.
Why We Request Google Drive Access
To **sync your saved links** across multiple devices logged into the same Google account.
To allow users to **restore their links** after reinstalling the app or switching devices.
To provide a **secure and private** backup option without relying on third-party servers.
How to Revoke Access
If you no longer wish to sync your data with Google Drive, you can revoke access:
Go to
Google Account Permissions
.
Find **LaterLinks** in the list of connected apps.
Select **Remove Access** to disconnect the app.
Crash Reporting
We use
Firebase Crashlytics
to collect crash data and improve app stability.
      Crashlytics gathers non-personally identifiable data, such as device type, OS version, and app state during
      crashes. This data is used **solely for debugging purposes**. Firebase's privacy policy can be found
here
.
In-App Purchases
The app uses the
Google Play Billing Library
to manage in-app purchases, granting
      access to premium features. LaterLinks **does not store or process any payment information**. All transactions
      are securely handled by Google Play. More details can be found in
Google Play's privacy policy
.
