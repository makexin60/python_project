It collects the following information from you:

Email address
User agents
IP addresses
User progress in the app
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent strings (a basic description of your device model) and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and authentication.
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you and to display personalized ads. The user can disable ads by making in-app purchases.

You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (such as an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous “Advertising Identifier.” Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.
