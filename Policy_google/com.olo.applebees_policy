Cookies.
We provide a variety of services on our Sites using cookies. We place
                        cookies on your device to provide you with personalized access to
                        essential services, enhance functionality, and show you offers and
                        services tailored to your interests. A cookie is a small piece of data
                        that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on
                        your hard drive as a “tag” that identifies your computer. Cookies help
                        to navigate from page to page on a website, provide secure connections,
                        gather statistics about the usage and effectiveness of our Sites, and
                        remember preferences from a previous visit when you return. We use
                        third-party services for analytics and interest-based advertising
                        purposes. These service providers and ad partners may use cookies alone
                        or in conjunction with unique identifiers, beacons, and other tracking
                        technologies to collect information about you when you use our Sites,
                        open our emails, or interact with our ads. Most web browsers
                        automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings
                        to disable all or certain cookies if you wish. Please note that by
                        disabling or deleting cookies, you may not be able to access the full
                        functionality of our Sites. Disabling or clearing cookies also may
                        affect cookie-based opt-outs by either preventing you from using such
                        cookie-based opt-outs or clearing opt-outs that you previously set.
Do Not Track.
Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for
                        recognizing or honoring Do Not Track (“
DNT
”) signals,
                        we do not respond to them at this time.
Location data.
You may opt out of having your location data collected by Dine at any
                        time by editing the appropriate setting on your mobile device (which is
                        usually located in the settings of your device) or by emailing

, if applicable.
7.0 De-Identified/Aggregate Information
Dine may collect, use, share, transfer, and otherwise process de-identified and aggregated information that it receives or creates for any purpose at its sole discretion, in compliance with applicable laws. Dine is the sole and exclusive owner of such de-identified and aggregated information, including if Dine de-identifies Personal Information so that it is no longer considered Personal Information under applicable laws.
8.0 Data Automatically Collected
Dine uses Google Analytics to process Personal Information about your use of our Sites. Google sets cookies on your browser or device, and then your web browser will automatically send information to Google. Google uses this information to provide us with reports that we use to better understand and measure how users interact with our Sites.

Google’s Privacy Policy
and Google’s page on "
How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps That Use Our Services
.” You may download the

We use third parties and/or service providers to provide interest-based
                    advertising services. These services may serve advertisements on our behalf
                    that are customized based on predictions about your interests generated
                    from your visits to websites (including our Sites) over time and across
                    different websites. The data collected may be associated with your Personal
                    Information. These advertisements may appear on our Sites and on other
                    websites and may be sent to you via email.
We use Google Ads to serve ads across various websites. Google uses Cookies
                    to collect data about your visits to our Sites to generate targeted
                    advertisements to you on other websites that you visit. To opt out of this
                    type of advertising by Google, customize your ad preferences, or limit
                    Google’s collection or use of such data, visit
Google’s Safety Center
and
Google’s Ad Settings
and follow
Google’s Personalized Ad Opt-Out Instructions.
Opting out will not affect your use of our Sites.
To change your preferences with respect to certain online ads or obtain
                    more information about ad networks and online behavioral advertising, visit
National Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page
or the
Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program.
Changing your settings with individual browsers or ad networks will not
                    necessarily carry over to other browsers or ad networks. As a result,
                    depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads. Opting
                    out of targeted advertising does not opt you out of all ads, just those
                    targeted to you.
Google Maps.
Our Sites contain maps provided by third parties and/or service providers
                    for your convenience. Dine and such other parties may collect data about
                    how you interact with the maps. For example, Google may collect usage data
                    on maps embedded on the Sites. Even if you do not interact with the maps,
                    Google may still collect certain information about your interactions with
                    our Sites if you are signed into your Google account when accessing our
                    Sites. Please see Google's
Privacy Policy
for more
                    information.

11.0 How Long We Retain Your Personal Information?
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise required by applicable laws.

                    liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. We urge you
                    to read the privacy policies of other websites before submitting any
                    information to those websites. Please be aware that to submit job application materials online to work with us, you will be redirected from our Site to a website operated by our third-party service provider. You may be required to create an account with that vendor. We encourage you to review the terms and privacy policy posted on that vendor's website since this Privacy Policy does not govern your use of that website.

                        essential services, enhance functionality, and show you offers and
                        services tailored to your interests. A cookie is a small piece of data
                        that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on
                        your hard drive as a “tag” that identifies your computer. Cookies help
                        to navigate from page to page on a website, provide secure connections,
                        gather statistics about the usage and effectiveness of our Sites, and
                        remember preferences from a previous visit when you return. We use
                        third-party services for analytics and interest-based advertising
                        purposes. These service providers and ad partners may use cookies alone

                        disabling or deleting cookies, you may not be able to access the full
                        functionality of our Sites. Disabling or clearing cookies also may
                        affect cookie-based opt-outs by either preventing you from using such
                        cookie-based opt-outs or clearing opt-outs that you previously set.
Do Not Track.
Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for
                        recognizing or honoring Do Not Track (“
DNT

                        we do not respond to them at this time.

7.0	De-Identified/Aggregate Information
Dine may collect, use, share, transfer, and otherwise process de-identified and aggregated information that it receives or creates for any purpose at its sole discretion, in compliance with applicable laws. Dine is the sole and exclusive owner of such de-identified and aggregated information, including if Dine de-identifies Personal Information so that it is no longer considered Personal Information under applicable laws.

Dine uses Google Analytics to process Personal Information about your use of our Sites. Google sets cookies on your browser or device, and then your web browser will automatically send information to Google. Google uses this information to provide us with reports that we use to better understand and measure how users interact with our Sites.

Google’s Privacy Policy
and Google’s page on "
How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps That Use Our Services
.” You may download the
Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On
for each web browser you use, but this does not prevent the use of other
                    analytics tools. To learn more about Google Analytics cookies, visit

We use third parties and/or service providers to provide interest-based advertising services. These services may serve advertisements on our behalf that are customized based on predictions about your  interests  generated  from  your  visits  to  websites  (including  our  Sites)  over  time  and  across different  websites.  The  data  collected  may  be  associated  with  your  Personal  Information.  These advertisements may appear on our Sites and on other websites and may be sent to you via email.
We  use  Google  Ads  to  serve  ads  across  various  websites.  Google  uses  cookies  to  collect  data about your visits to our Sites to generate targeted advertisements to you on other websites that you visit.  To  opt  out  of  this  type  of  advertising  by  Google,  customize  your  ad  preferences,  or  limit Google’s collection or use of such data, visit
Google’s Safety Center
and
Google’s Ad Settings
and follow
Google’s Personalized Ad Opt-Out Instructions

Opting out will not affect your use of our Sites.
To change your preferences with respect to certain online ads or obtain more information about ad networks and online behavioral advertising, visit
National Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out  Page
or  the
Digital  Advertising  Alliance  Self-Regulatory  Program
.
Changing  your  settings with individual browsers or ad networks will not necessarily carry over to other browsers or ad networks. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads. Opting out of targeted advertising does not opt you out of all ads, just those targeted to you.
Google Maps
. Our Sites contain maps provided by third parties and/or service providers for your convenience. Dine and such other parties may collect data about how you interact with the maps. For example, Google may collect usage data on maps embedded on the Sites. Even if you do not interact with the maps, Google may still collect certain information about your interactions with our Sites if you are signed into your Google account when accessing our Sites. Please see Google's
Privacy Policy
for more information.
9.0	Social Media
We are active on social media including, but not limited to, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter/X, Instagram, and LinkedIn
(“Social Media”)
. Anything you post on Social Media is public information and will not be treated confidentially. We may post (or re-post) on the Sites and our Social Media pages any comments or content that you post on our Social Media pages.
Our Sites allow you to connect and share data with Social Media platforms. These features may require us to use cookies, plug-ins, and APIs provided by such Social Media platforms to facilitate those communications and features. Our Sites may use advertising networks and services offered by  Social  Media  platforms  to  deliver  advertising  content.  Use  of  these  services  requires  Social Media  platforms  to  implement  cookies  or  pixel  tags  to  deliver  ads  to  you  while  you  access  the Sites.
10.0	Location of Our Sites
Our Sites are hosted and operated in the United States. However, we and our service providers may store information about individuals in the United States, or we may transfer it to, and store it within, other countries.
11.0	How Long We Retain Your Personal Information
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise required by applicable laws. Criteria we will use to determine how long we will retain your Personal Information include whether we need your Personal Information to provide you with our Sites, Facilities, or other services; you have requested information from us; we have a legal right or obligation to continue to retain your Personal Information; we have an obligation to a third party that involves your Personal Information; our retention or recordkeeping policies and obligations dictate that we retain your Personal Information; or we have another business purpose for retaining your Personal Information.
12.0	Third-Party Links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our apps. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. We urge you to read the privacy policies of other websites before submitting any information to those websites. Please be aware that to submit job application materials online to work with us, you will be redirected from our Site to a website operated by our third-party service provider. You may be required to create an account with that vendor. We encourage you to review the terms and privacy policy posted on that vendor's website since this Privacy Policy does not govern your use of that website.

We strive to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, using security technologies and procedures, such as encryption and limited access; however, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information during its transmission or storage on our systems.
