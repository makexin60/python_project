European Union, the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom
If you’re a user located in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), you should know that Fishbrain AB is the controller of your personal data and you have several rights under the General Data Protection Regulation with respect to your personal data. Here is some additional information we would like to bring to your attention:
Transfers
. I
n certain situations, such as when we share your information within the Fishbrain Group, a service provider, a business partner or subcontractor which operates outside of the EU/EEA, we may collect your personal data from,
transfer it to, and/or store and process it outside of the EU/EEA
, including in the US
. Whenever Fishbrain transfers information of users within the EU/EEA outside of the EU/EEA, we take appropriate safeguards to ensure that the same level of protection applies to your personal data, according to the applicable privacy legislation in the respective countries. Your rights in respect to your personal data (described in Section 2), are not affected when data is transferred outside of the EU/EEA.
When transferring personal data to countries outside of the EU/EEA, these safeguards include, but are not limited to, ensuring implementation of the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses with applicable group companies, service providers and/or others. If the European Commission has decided that the country to which your personal data is being transferred has an adequate level of protection, we rely on that adequacy decision. You can read more about Standard Contractual Clauses and about which countries are deemed to have an adequate level of protection at
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en
.
We take technical and organizational measures so that your data remains protected during the transfer to the applicable country. However, if you choose to shop at a store located in a country outside the EU/EEA, our data sharing with that foreign store, to administer your specific purchase, means that your personal data will be transferred to this country. You can always contact us at

“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services.

For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users.

Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services.

Stripe Affiliates

These providers offer critical services such as providing cloud infrastructure, conducting analytics for the assessment of the speed, accuracy, and/or security of our Services, verifying identities, identifying potentially harmful activity, and providing customer service and audit functions. We authorize these service providers to use or disclose the Personal Data we make available to them to perform services on our behalf and to comply with relevant legal obligations.

Others with Consent

In these instances, we will disclose the identity of the third party and the information to be shared with them, and seek your consent to share the information.
Corporate Transactions
. If we enter or intend to enter a transaction that modifies the structure of our business, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, change of control, or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets, or stock, we may share Personal Data with third parties in connection with such transaction. Any other entity that buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your Personal Data, subject to the terms of this Policy.
Compliance and Harm Prevention
. We share Personal Data when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable law; to abide by rules imposed by Financial Partners in connection with the use of their payment method; to enforce our contractual rights; to secure and protect the Services, rights, privacy, safety, and property of Stripe, you, and others, including against malicious or fraudulent activity; and to respond to valid legal requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include authorities outside your country of residence.
