Applicability
. These Data Processing Terms apply to the extent that the Business Terms state that WhatsApp Processes Personal Information in your Customer Data as your Processor. In the case of an express
conflict between these Data Processing Terms and the Business Terms, these Data Processing Terms will govern solely to the extent of the conflict.
Our Obligations as Processor
. To the extent required by applicable Data Privacy Law, WhatsApp and you agree to the following:
WhatsApp shall only Process Personal Information in accordance with your instructions as set out in the Business Terms and these Data Processing Terms.
WhatsApp confirms that:
the duration, subject matter, nature and purpose of the Processing shall be as specified in the Business Terms;
the types of Personal Information Processed comprise customer contact information as described in the Business Terms;
the categories of Data Subjects comprise customers with whom you communicate using the WhatsApp service; and
your obligations and rights as Controller in relation to this Personal Information are as set out in these Data Processing Terms.
WhatsApp shall ensure that any person authorised to Process Personal Information under these Data Processing Terms is bound by appropriate obligations of confidentiality.
WhatsApp will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Information processed under these Data Processing Terms including against unauthorized or unlawful Processing
or accidental loss, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include the measures listed in the
Data Security Terms
(as updated
from time to time, for example, to reflect technological developments) which are expressly incorporated into these Data Processing Terms;
WhatsApp will notify you without undue delay of the discovery by WhatsApp of any Personal Information Breach;
Taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to WhatsApp, WhatsApp will assist you in your role as a Controller, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar
as this is possible, in fulfilling any obligations under Data Privacy Law applicable to you as a Controller to respond to requests from Data Subjects regarding the exercise of their Data Subject rights;
To the extent required by Data Privacy Law applicable to you as the Controller, the Processor agrees to support your obligations as a Controller, in particular regarding the security of the Processing or
regarding Personal Information Breaches, by providing you with reasonable assistance, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to WhatsApp;
Upon your request, WhatsApp will make available to you all information and provide all assistance that is reasonably necessary to demonstrate WhatsApp’s compliance with its legal obligations as a Processor
under these Data Processing Terms;
WhatsApp may subcontract its Processing obligations under these Data Processing Terms to a sub-processor, who may be based in a country other than the one in which you or WhatsApp are located given the global
nature of the WhatsApp service, including the European Economic Area or the United States, only by way of written agreement that shall impose obligations on the sub-processor that are no less rigorous than
the obligations imposed upon WhatsApp by these Data Processing Terms. WhatsApp will remain fully liable to you for the performance of that sub-processor’s obligations. Where WhatsApp Ireland Limited is your
contracting entity, the
WhatsApp Business Data Transfer Addendum
applies and is incorporated by reference into these Data
Processing Terms. If you are located in the United Kingdom and WhatsApp LLC is your contracting entity, the
WhatsApp Business UK Data Transfer Addendum
, which is incorporated by reference into these Data Processing Terms, applies with respect to your transfer of Personal Information to WhatsApp LLC and Meta Platforms Inc. (formerly known as Facebook Inc.).
Without limiting Section 3.i. above, you hereby authorize WhatsApp to engage other Meta Companies and third parties as its sub-processor(s). Subject to applicable Data Privacy Law, WhatsApp will notify you in
advance of any changes related to its sub-processor(s). If you reasonably object to such changes, you may inform WhatsApp in writing and stop using our Business Services; and
Upon termination of the Business Terms, WhatsApp shall cease Processing Personal Information and shall delete it within the time period set forth in the Business Terms unless applicable law requires further
storage or to the extent that WhatsApp has a right or obligation to use the Personal Information independent of the Business Terms.
