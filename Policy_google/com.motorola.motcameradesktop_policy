Digital TV will collect certain anonymous event-based data, such as which channels are launched via Digital TV.
Moto (Personalise, Gestures, Tips, Display, Play)
Moto makes your device more responsive by giving you more ways to control and interact with it. Moto makes it easier for you to get important notifications, control your device with your voice and gestures, and automate useful settings changes depending on where you are or what you may be doing at the time.
Gestures (formerly Moto Actions) makes it easier to interact with your Motorola products by letting you use simple gestures to perform tasks quickly. For example, through Gestures (Moto Actions) you can:
Twist your wrist quickly to open the camera anytime.
Swipe down to the left or right to make the screen smaller for one-handed use.
Turn your flashlight on or off by making two
‘karate chop’
motions; among other actions.
Moto Display will show important notifications on the screen of supported products so you can get quick access to them without having to power on the screen or unlock your home screen. Moto Display accesses certain content like your contacts, calendar entries, along with other apps and the notifications they send you.
To complete these tasks, Moto:
Collects information about your Motorola device's current location and uploads it to Motorola to help identify places of interest and to determine when you may be in a vehicle.
Uses contextual data obtained from your device's microphone and sensors like the accelerometer and gyroscope to determine when to activate certain modes, but does not upload it to Motorola.
Accesses user-generated content like your calendar entries, contacts, and call history, but does not upload it to Motorola.
Motorola uses data hosting and processing service providers to support these activities. In addition, Moto utilizes Google Activity Recognition to help understand contextual data and determine which modes to activate. Once transferred to Google, the contextual data is handled in accordance with Google's Terms of Service and
Google's privacy policy
. Google's privacy policy also provides further information on Google's data collection and protection practices related to other Google analytics and product development tools that Motorola may use from time to time.
Moto Face Unlock
If enabled on certain Motorola devices, Moto face unlock lets you unlock your device by looking at the display. To function, the device will need to
‘enrol’
your face detection information (using the Camera permission) in the data/cache area of the device. This face enrolment information will not be uploaded to Motorola and will not be shared with third parties. You may later delete your face enrolment information via device Settings.
Moto fingerprint unlock
If enabled on certain Motorola devices, Moto fingerprint unlock lets you unlock your device with your fingerprint. To function, the device will need to
‘enrol’
your fingerprint detection information in the data/cache area of the device. This fingerprint enrolment information will not be uploaded to Motorola and will not be shared with third parties. You may later delete your fingerprint enrolment information via device Settings.
Motorola Family Space (when used on a single device)
Family Space limits your device to a single
‘Space’
and lets you control which applications are available. You can turn on a Space when you let a child use your device, or to protect against accidental gestures. You can create multiple Spaces and choose which applications are available for use within each Space. If you have enabled Enhanced device support or Help Improve functionality on your Motorola Products, usage information we collect from Family Space includes metrics like (a) how many Spaces are used, (b) number of apps used inside each Space, (c) which grid layout is used and (d) how long the Space is in use; usage data does not include what occurs inside any Space.
Motorola Family Space (when used to connect multiple devices)
Family Space can also let you stay connected with family members and remotely manage their devices. You can add grandparents, children and other relatives to your Family Space account and determine, together, whether a family member's device will be
‘managed’
or
‘non-managed’
. To use Family Space device management features, you must have a Motorola ID and the user who creates a family on the application is the Account Owner. The Account Owner and other family members who are entitled to use remote device management features are Family Space Administrators (
‘Admins’
) and can monitor and set rules for managed devices; rules include what applications can be used and limits on screen time. All the individuals connected to the Account Owner's Family Space account (
‘Family Members’
) can see a simplified view of other Family Members' profiles and their locations on a map.
The Account Owner can invite other individuals to use Family Space and connect to the Account Owner's Family Space account by entering into the application the individual's email address. Before submitting an individual's email address, the Account Owner must obtain the individual's consent to sharing their email address for the purpose of using Family Space. Motorola will use the email address to transmit the invitation and connect the individual's device to the Account Owner's Family Space account. Once connected, the individual is considered a
‘Family Member’
for purposes of this statement.
Admins are responsible for setting up devices intended for use by minors under the age of 16. This includes installing the Family Space application on the managed device, pairing the device to the Admin's Family Space account and granting device permissions necessary for Family Space to function as intended (in particular, setting rules about which applications will be available and the amount of permitted screen time). Parents are encouraged to use the pairing process as an opportunity to discuss with their children how Family Space will make information about them available to parents and other Family Members.
Admins select and control the profile pictures for each Family Member. Profile pictures are displayed to all Family Members. If you wish to change the picture associated with your Family Space profile, contact an Admin.
Family Space will make available to Admins the list of installed applications on managed devices so they can set rules about which applications can be used on those devices. Family Space does not process the list of installed applications on non-managed devices.
Family Space will collect and maintain the last-known location of Family Members' devices when those devices have the sharing of location data turned on. For managed devices, Admins determine whether the sharing of location data is enabled. Users of non-managed devices can choose whether to enable the sharing of their location data with Family Members and can change their preferences at any time through the Family Space settings menu.
To enable Family Space remote management features, certain data is transmitted to Motorola and stored for your use, including profile pictures and last-known device locations. Lists of applications installed on managed devices are also transmitted and stored for use by Admins. These types of information are stored so Family Space users have ready access to this information when they need to use it.
Family Space will automatically send to Motorola and share with Family Members your device model and manufacturer. This data is shown in your user profile.
Family Space can collect and report usage information to Motorola to improve its products and services. When Family Space is used to connect with Family Members and remotely manage devices, each device user decides, for their device, whether to share usage data with Motorola. The types of usage data collected by Motorola include your role in Family Space, as well as metrics like the number of Family Members and how often certain features are used or updated.
Certain Family Space application data is transferred to Motorola, including last-known device location data, profile pictures, lists of applications installed on managed devices, and usage data. This information is securely stored and processed on servers located in the United States with access restricted to approved members of Motorola's production and support teams to provide you with technical and customer services. Motorola does not record or store any history of locations visited by any device and any list of applications installed on a managed device is deleted at the time the device is removed from the Account Owner's family. Other application data is stored for three years after last interaction.
Rating & feedback
Rating & feedback lets you rate your device and share feedback with Motorola and Lenovo to help Motorola and Lenovo make improvements that enhance the hardware and software experience. To provide functionality, Moto Feedback will collect the Motorola device ID, your contact information and certain non-personally identifiable device and application event and analytics information; you have the option to add a screenshot. Motorola and Lenovo may use third party data hosting and processing service providers to support these activities. External software development partners may also have access to certain non-personally identifiable feedback information in order to troubleshoot problems or to improve the Motorola device experience.
Motorola Marketplace
Motorola conducts business brokerage activities via a platform (Motorola Marketplace), through which business partners sell their own products and services. If you use Motorola Marketplace, we may share with these partners your personal information, such as name, Social Security number, email address, billing and delivery address, telephone number and payment information, as necessary to conduct business and/or complete their respective transactions.

Moto Body
The Moto Body application, which is no longer supported by Motorola but which may still be used on certain smart watches, uses sensors built into the wearable device to collect wellness-related data such as your heart rate, step count and calories so that you can track your progress towards daily and weekly activity goals. You can also create a wellness profile by providing demographic information such as your height, weight, gender and age. This will help your Moto Body provide more accurate wellness information. If you use the Moto Body Running feature, Moto Body will also track and display your location on your device.
Moto Body can upload your wellness profile, data and location to our cloud and add it to your user profile. We use this information to provide you with access to more accurate wellness information such as activity statistics over time.

Please note that, in these cases, we may record calls and chat session transcripts for staff training and quality assurance purposes. To provide you with the service or support that you have requested, such as requesting technical support or repair under a warranty for your Lenovo Product, Lenovo customer service personnel may also collect and access personal information about you, such as your user profile, account information, contact information, Lenovo Product and service identifiers, and information about how you use your Lenovo Product and service.

You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers or receiving it from sellers.
Legal requirements and to enforce Lenovo's rights
It is possible that personal information will be subject to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders, or criminal and anti-fraud investigations. Therefore, when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, we may disclose personal or other information to regulatory or government bodies, courts of law, tribunals, and law enforcement agencies.

Does Lenovo sell my personal information?
Lenovo does not sell (as
‘sell’
is traditionally defined) personal information of customers of any age. Some privacy laws, however, classify certain sharing of personal information for advertising purposes as a
‘sale’
even though recipients of the data are subject to contract terms with Lenovo that severely limit their rights to use and retain the information that Lenovo shares with them. In the 12 months prior to the publication of this Statement, Lenovo has shared to advertisers, ad networks, advertising partners and advertising measurement providers, pursuant to written contracts, the following categories of personal information:
Identifiers including, device identifiers, IP addresses, browser cookies and other unique online identifiers;
Internet activity information including data about a consumer's interaction with an Internet website, application, service or advertisement;
User Profile information including email address and location information; and
Inferences drawn from Personal Information, including preferences, interests, and other data used to personalise a consumer's experience.
Lenovo may shares these categories of personal information with Lenovo's third- party service providers and partners for cross contextual behavioral advertising purposes, to target ads, to provide analytics and reporting related to the effectiveness of advertising, to support Lenovo Products and/or to provide additional services to Lenovo and its customers and product users. In doing so, Lenovo takes appropriate steps to ensure that these service providers and partners are meeting Lenovo's standards of robust privacy and strong security.
Does Lenovo transfer my personal information internationally?
Lenovo is a global organisation, with legal entities, business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. Therefore, where permitted by law, we may share your personal information within Lenovo (including to subsidiaries, affiliates and parent companies) or our service providers and business partners and may transfer it to countries in the world where we do business (including, but not limited to, the United States of America and People's Republic of China). Regardless of where your information is transferred to and resides, our privacy and security practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information globally.
Some countries have privacy laws that are not equivalent to the privacy laws in your own country. In such countries, Lenovo will still handle information in the manner we describe here and will take such measures as are necessary to comply with applicable data protection laws when transferring and processing your information. Where required, Lenovo will also maintain agreements between Lenovo group companies or with Lenovo partners or suppliers to govern the transferring, processing and protection of personal information.
To help effectuate transfers of personal information globally including from and within the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland and United Kingdom, Lenovo uses different means to comply with local requirements, including but not limited to Standard Contractual Clauses and government approvals.
How long will my personal information be retained?
Lenovo intends to retain information, including personal information, only as long as necessary for business or other compelling purposes; and to securely delete personal information when those purposes of use have been satisfied. We will retain your information, including personal information, for as long as any of the following circumstances apply:
Your account or subscription is active
To provide you with services or support that you may have requested
To ensure required functionality and performance of Lenovo Products and websites, including responsibilities under our product warranties
To comply with applicable laws, including for tax and audit purposes
To enforce Lenovo's rights, including litigation and debt collection
How is my information protected?
We use standard technical and organisational measures when we transmit information from Lenovo Products to our servers, when we store data and when we share data with third parties. For example, we use encryption when transmitting sensitive information to keep your information secure. When sharing your information with third parties, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that such parties protect and use your information responsibly.
Lenovo Products may also include security features designed to help you protect the information you store on your Lenovo Product(s). These may include solutions like encryption; passwords, PIN, face and fingerprint unlock; and remote control over your Lenovo Product(s) so you can locate, lock and erase lost or stolen products. You can learn more about available features by accessing the Security Settings on your Lenovo Product(s).
However, please remember that no product, software or data transmission can be guaranteed to be one hundred percent secure.
As a result, while we have taken appropriate steps to protect your product(s) and your information, Lenovo cannot ensure or otherwise warrant the security of your Lenovo Product(s) or any information that you provide to us. By using Lenovo Products, you do so at your own risk. For more information on Lenovo Product security and how to contact Lenovo's Product security team with questions or security vulnerabilities, please visit the

What about my child's privacy?
Unless otherwise stated for a specific product or service, Lenovo Products are intended for adults and children aged 16 and over, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, who have permission from their parents or legal guardians to use them. Lenovo does not knowingly collect data from children as defined by applicable law without the prior consent of their parents or legal guardians, or as otherwise permitted by law.
If Lenovo learns that a child under the age of 16, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, has submitted personal information via Lenovo Products, we will take appropriate steps to delete the information as soon as possible and will not use it for any purpose. Lenovo encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of Lenovo Products and to inform them of the potential dangers of providing information about themselves.

You may also use an authorized agent to submit a request under this section on your behalf. If you choose to have an authorized agent submit such a request on your behalf, Lenovo will require: (i) You to provide the authorized agent written permission to do so; and (ii) your agent to verify their identity directly with Lenovo.
