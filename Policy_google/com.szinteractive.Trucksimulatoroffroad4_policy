1. Non-personal Data
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you.

3. Ad Serving Technology
Ruslan Chetverikov reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Ruslan Chetverikov or Ruslan Chetverikov's partners and contractors.

Ruslan Chetverikov or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. Ruslan Chetverikov or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including but not limited to for purposes of determining your coarse location), Device ID, MAC, software, applications, hardware, and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.
