CHILD PROTECTION
Our apps are destined to any public but we have implemented an age limit that deactivates all features that allow the collection, use, disclosure and sharing of personal data for children under the age of 16 according toEEA data protection legislation (GDPR) and under the age of 13 in specific territories (US included) according COPPA legislation.
We do not voluntarily collect personal data for children under the age limit according the legislation, with the sole exception of their year of birth and persistent identifiers as described below. We do not store or share the users’ age but only the fact that their age is below the limit.
Persistent identifiers (such as anonymous user ID, IP address, IDFA, IDFV, ID or IMEI for Android devices,
advertising identifiers) are used and shared for providing our advertising partners with the information stating that the user is under the age limit. At our request, our advertising partners undertake to meet the same requirements as us with regards to the privacy policy concerning children and limit the usage of information collected to meet the legal requirement. Therefore, they are allowed to serve contextual advertising, providing analyses regarding the app, the game industry and the device used, and authenticating users to ensure compliance with legal requirements. We cannot be held responsible in case of breaches in their commitments.
If we become aware that we are storing personal data regarding a child under the age limit according the legislation, we undertake to delete the data within a reasonable time and without the need for a
disproportionate technical effort.

In addition we collect technical information related to your device such as your storage size, screen size, installed apps, network status, access to internal and external storage, time zone, mobile phone carrier, device language, locale, country code.
