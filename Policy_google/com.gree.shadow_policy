Introduction and Your Agreement to this Privacy Policy
MunkyFun, Inc. and its affiliates (“MunkyFun”, “us”, “our” or “we”) are dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users (“users”, “your”, or “you”). This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information, including personal information, that you provide or we collect in connection with our website at

Personal information can include, for example, an individual’s first and last name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to information collected or received by MunkyFun through your use of the Service. MunkyFun is not responsible for the actions of third party people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Any link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.
BY INSTALLING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICE. We may update this Policy from time to time. You are responsible for periodically reading this Policy. We will post all changes to this Policy on this page and the modified policy will specify its effective date.

You may choose to withdraw your consent to the Privacy Policy, and request deletion of all data that we collect about you, at any time after granting approval.  If you wish to withdraw your consent, and have the data that we store about you deleted,  contact
info@munkyfun.com
.  Be advised that we will not be able recover data (including your game account) once it is deleted.
Information Collected and Used
Our primary objective in collecting your information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable you to easily navigate and enjoy the Service. For example, MunkyFun may use your information to register your account, provide customer support, resolve disputes, collect fees, connect users, and notify you of updates to the game (or of other/new games) and special promotions.
iOS or Android Platforms
When you use any of the MunkyFun games or applications, we automatically collect and record certain information such as your unique device ID, MAC address, advertising identifer, OpenUDID, IMEI number, hardware type, the version of your operating system (“OS”), your in-game activity, and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address). This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends.
We may ask whether you’d like to provide us with certain pieces of information, which could include: your email and username. If you provide your email address in connection with an application, the email address will be retained and may be used to contact you about your gaming experience and notify you about news and marketing promotions, including from the third party publishers or content licensors of such application as set forth below. We may also use your username or part of your email address for friend-to-friend or user-to-user interaction and chat, voice or messaging functionality and other similar features. Your username may be used for social features in our games (e.g., presenting someone’s name on a message board).
MunkyFun uses country information to customize the user experience and promotions, enforce our terms of service, and make recommendations about user connections.
We may also give users the opportunity to opt-in to location-based services, which rely upon a device’s GPS coordinates. You may opt-out of these location services via the settings on your device. A user’s location may be used to suggest friends with whom they might want to connect, analyze usage trends or target certain promotions.
Some of our games or applications may permit a user to record his or her voice and share such recordings with an opponent in the context of such game or application. MunkyFun may use these recordings and post them as well as the contents of your play sessions on Facebook on a publicly available page (and link your data with your opponent). MunkyFun may store these recordings on its servers.

Please note that these platforms/marketplaces were developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by MunkyFun and that MunkyFun is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies.

A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk, generally to quickly identify a user’s computer and to “remember” things about the user’s visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. The Service sends cookies to your computer when you access or view content of a MunkyFun game. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use. You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.
We may feature advertisements served by third party advertising companies which deliver cookies to your computer so the ads you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies tag your computer with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
Web Beacons
We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons or “gifs”, are electronic images that may be used on our Site or in our emails. We may use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
