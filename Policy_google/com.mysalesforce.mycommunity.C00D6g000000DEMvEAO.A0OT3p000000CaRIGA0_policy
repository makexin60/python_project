www.grifolsplasma.com
(the "Website") and from individuals who visit the Grifols Donation Centers (each a “Donation Center”), including those who donate plasma and/or whole blood (collectively with the Website, the “Services”).
We provide this Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to describe the information we collect, how we use it, and when and with whom we share it. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise communicating with us in the context of your use of the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the Services or communicate with us through the Services.
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services and not other products or services we may offer or provide. Please review the applicable privacy policy for those other products and services we may offer or provide. Please review the applicable privacy policy for those other products and services to understand how we process personal information collected from those products and services.
We obtain information about you through the means discussed below when we provide the Services. Please note that we need certain types of information to provide the Services to you. If you do not provide us with such information, or if you ask us to delete that information, you may no longer be able to access or use certain Services.

c. Information we collect automatically
Device/Usage Information.
We and our third-party vendors, which include ad networks and analytics companies such as Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Website. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring or exit pages; (f) page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or Android ID); and (i) the type of device that you use.

We use this information (including the information collected by our third-party vendors) for analytics (including to determine which portions of the Website are used most frequently and what our users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and off the Website), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.
We and our third-party vendors may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Services. These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Website to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Website. We or our third- party vendors also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Website, because the Website may not function properly. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods. Please see our Cookie Policy for additional detail.
Location Information. When you use the Website, we may collect general location information (such as general location inferred from an IP address).
We use your information for business and commercial purposes, such as:
To provide our Services, including the Website;
To respond to your questions or inquiries;
For research and development, including to develop new and improve existing therapies;
To manage and remember your preferences and personalize the Services;
To operate our donor program and verify your eligibility to participate in our donor program;
To communicate with you and send you notices that may be of interest to you, such as marketing information, donor reminders, and other donor incentive information;
To analyze and improve the Services or any other products and services we provide;
To comply with our legal obligations or as permitted by law;
To protect the safety and/or integrity of our users, employees, third parties, members of the public, and/or our Services;
To prevent fraud and enforce our legal terms; and
To administer and troubleshoot the Services.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Services. We may use de- identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes and may also share such data with any third parties.
We may disclose information in the following ways:
Affiliates
. We may disclose your information to any Grifols affiliates.
Consent/At Your Direction.
We may disclose your information to nonaffiliated third parties based on your consent to do so.
Vendors
. We provide access to or disclose your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf. They provide a variety of services to us, including data storage, research and development, analytics, billing, marketing, product content and features, customer service, data storage, security, fraud prevention, and legal services.
Protection of Grifols and Others

We may disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to (i) protect or defend the rights, safety, or property of Grifols or third parties, including to defend or enforce our Privacy Policy or any other contractual arrangement; (ii) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (iii) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Grifols, its agents and affiliates, its employees, users and/or the public.

Business Transfer.
We may disclose certain information, in connection with or during negotiations of any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
Aggregate/Anonymous Information:
From time to time, we may disclose aggregate/anonymous information about the Services. The disclosure of such data is unrestricted.
Analytics
: We may use third-party web analytics services on our Website, such as those of Google Analytics. These vendors use the sort of technology previously described in the “Information we collect automatically” section to help us analyze how users use the Website, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these vendors, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Website. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking
here
.
If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications.
Advertising
: The Website may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising websites you visit and other applications you use. These cookies and other tracking technologies may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Website in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions, other uses of marketing services, and interactions with these marketing impressions and marketing services are related to visits to our websites. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Website. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a vendor in hashed, non-human-readable form. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out
Link
and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance's (“DAA”) Consumer Opt-Out
Link
to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page
here
. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Website, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content may not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites, accessible by the above links.
Our Services are not designed for minors under 18. Only persons 18 years of age or older may use the Services. If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will close the account and delete the personal information to the extent required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We may, where permitted by law, retain certain information internally for purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
We implement technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Intenet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.
We generally retain information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above and in compliance with applicable law. To dispose of any personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional period of time.

The Website may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third parties.
We currently maintain computer systems in the United States, so your personal information may be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. For example, data may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. By using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to that required in other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may change this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our information practices or the features of the Services. At the top of our Privacy Policy, we will indicate the date of the most recent update. If we make a material change to the Policy, you will be provided with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Privacy Policy.
