The following are your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information:
Notifications
.  We may send you push or SMS notifications and similar forms of communication from us, which you can control within the Services. We will not provide your phone number to non-service provider third parties for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
Marketing-related emails from us
.  If you no longer want to receive marketing related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt out by contacting us via the “Contact Us” information above or opting out using the link in the bottom of the email.  Opting out may prevent you from receiving notification including notices regarding updates, improvements, or offers.  Please note that if you opt out of receiving marketing related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages about the Services, from which you cannot opt out.
Your Targeted Advertising Preferences
Targeted Advertising Self-Regulatory Opt-Outs
.  We may work with third-party partners to deliver targeted advertisements based on your interests (also known as “interest-based advertising”).  To opt out of interest-based advertising, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) opt-out page at www.aboutads.info/choices or the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) opt-out page at www.networkadvertising.org/choices.  Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising will not stop you from seeing ads, but the ads will no longer be tailored to your interests.  You may also download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out from participating companies in mobile apps.
Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements through one of these programs, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our services.  Instead, it means that the online ads you do see from relevant program participants should not be based on your interests.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.  In addition, program participants may still use automatic data collection technologies to collect information about your use of our services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the applicable advertising industry program.
Apple/Android
.  You can control whether we can collect your mobile advertising identifier for advertising through settings on your Apple and Android devices.
Cookies
.  To manage cookies, an individual may have the ability to change their browser settings to (for example):  (i) notify them when they receive a cookie, so the individual can choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) automatically reject cookies (or certain types of cookies, such as cookies set by third parties).  Note that similar controls may or may not exist for other tracking technologies, such as pixels, SDKs, and localStorage.  Please check your device or browser settings and related documentation for more information.
Further, note that restricting the use of these technologies might negatively impact an individual’s experience using the Services, as some features or offerings may be less personalized or may not work as otherwise intended. Depending on an individual’s device and operating system, the individual may not be able to delete or block all cookies or other tracking technologies described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if an individual wants to reject cookies across all browsers and devices, the individual will need to do so on each browser and device they use. You may also have options within your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain actions with respect to such emails (e.g., URL clickthroughs).
5) Third-Party Services, Including Payment Service
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which our Services link.  The inclusion of a link on our Services does not imply our endorsement of the linked site or service.
In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with our Platform.
Our Services provide functionality allowing you to make payments using third-party payment services with which you have created your own account.  When you use such a service to make a payment to us, your personal information will be collected by such third party, not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
6. Retention
We will keep your personal information for as long as your user account is active, in order to allow you to have access to your personal information and to provide you with our services.
We may continue to retain your personal information even after you deactivate your user account or stop using the Services, as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes regarding our users, enforce our agreements, or protect our legitimate interests, consistent with applicable law.
7) Security
We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section above.
8) Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is current as of the “Last Updated” date set forth above. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on our Site and App.
U.S. State Privacy Notice

CCPA
”), Colorado Privacy Act, Oregon Consumer Privacy Act), as opposed to sector-specific laws (e.g., HIPAA).
For clarity, this U.S. State Privacy Notice also does not apply to protected health information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“
HIPAA
”).  Once you create an account to become a patient, use the  K Pharmacy services or otherwise use the services of any other member of our
Organized Health Care Arrangement
(“
OHCA
”), all personal information you provide to us through your account while using the Services is subject to the OHCA’s joint HIPAA
Notice of Privacy Practices

Your Privacy Rights
Depending on your state of residency, you may exercise the following rights under the State Privacy Laws in relation to the personal information about you that we have collected about you (subject to certain limitations under such laws, such as exceptions in the State Privacy Laws or the inability to verify your identity):
The Right to Access
Under the State Privacy Laws, you have the right to obtain confirmation regarding whether we are processing your personal information and to access that personal information and, in some cases, information about the third parties who may receive such personal information.  You also have the right to access that personal information in a portable, readily usable format, unless not technically feasible to provide in such a format.
Specifically with respect to the CCPA’s right to access, you have the right to request the following: (a) the specific pieces of personal information the business has collected about you and (b) the categories of personal information collected, the sources of collection, the business/commercial purpose for collecting or “selling/sharing” personal information, and the categories of third party to whom the business discloses personal information.
The Right to Deletion
You have the right to request the deletion of personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions under the State Privacy Laws.
The Right to Correction
You have the right to request that inaccuracies in your personal information be corrected, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of your personal information.
Opt-Out Rights
Under State Privacy Laws, you have the right to opt-out of “sales” and “shares” of personal information and “targeted advertising”. A “sale” is defined broadly under State Privacy Laws and includes any disclosure of personal information to a “third party” for any benefit (whether or not the disclosure involves an exchange of money).
We may “sell” your sensitive personal data.  Please read the disclosures below for more details.
As further described in this Privacy Policy, we disclose the following personal information to our advertising/marketing and analytics partners (e.g., advertisers/agencies, publishers such as social media networks, customer analytics/intelligence platforms, adtech partners like exchanges, SSPs, and DSPs) for advertising and marketing purposes, including direct marketing:  identifiers, commercial information, geolocation data, sensitive personal information, and internet or other network information.  Please see our “Your Privacy Choices” link (found in the website footer) to exercise your opt-out rights for “sales”/“shares”/“targeted advertising” and processing of “sensitive personal information” accordingly.
Further:
We do not have actual knowledge of “selling” or “sharing” PI of consumers under sixteen (16) years of age.
We do not engage in “profiling that results in legal or similarly significant effects,” as such is defined under State Privacy Laws.
To Exercise Your Privacy Rights
To submit a request to exercise your right to access, deletion, or correction please email
privacy@khealth.com
.  You may also call us at
888-564-5250
for assistance on exercising rights requests (where State Privacy Laws require that we provide another means for such assistance).
To exercise your right to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” and “targeted advertising,” please click our
Your Privacy Choices
link (found in the Site footer) and follow the instructions therein.  You may also visit our Site with the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal enabled to opt-out of “sales/shares/targeted advertising” (learn more about GPC at
www.globalprivacycontrol.org
).  The “sale/share/targeted advertising” opt-out is on a per-website basis and applies at the browser level for the device you use to opt out.
Unless otherwise prohibited by the State Privacy Laws, we may need to verify your identity and confirm your residency before processing your request.  In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems.  This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address, phone number, or date of last transaction on our Services.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your personal information in our systems.  If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
Non-Discrimination and Appeals
You have the right to not receive “discriminatory” treatment for exercising the rights discussed in the table above.  However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.
Further, under certain State Privacy Laws, you may appeal our decision to not take action on your rights request.  All appeals should be submitted by emailing
privacy@khealth.com
along with a copy of the decision that you are appealing.
Authorized Agents
In certain circumstances under the State Privacy Laws, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf (using the mechanisms for submitting requests above), to the extent we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.
For requests to access, delete, or correct personal information, we may require the following for verification purposes:
a power of attorney from you or your authorized agent that is valid under the laws of the applicable state where you reside; or
sufficient evidence to show that you have:
provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf; and
verified your own identity directly with us or directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.
For requests to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” or the processing of your personal information for “targeted advertising” under the State Privacy Laws, we may require a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
Deidentified Information
Where we process “deidentified information” (as such term is defined under the State Privacy Laws) and are required to keep such information deidentified, we commit to maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, except in instances where necessary for determining whether the deidentification process we used satisfies the requirements under applicable law.

Your Choices
For certain health information, you can tell us your choices about what we share. If you have a clear preference for how we share your information in the situations described below, talk to us. Tell us what you want us to do, and we will follow your instructions.
In these cases, you have both the right and choice to tell us to:
Share information with your family, close friends, or others involved in your care;
Share information with your emergency contact in the event of an emergency; and
Share information in a disaster relief situation.
We may also share your information when needed to lessen a serious and imminent threat to health or safety.
In these cases we never share your information unless you give us your authorization:
Marketing (as defined under HIPAA) purposes; and the
Sale of your information.
Our Uses and Disclosures
How do we typically use or share your health information?
We typically use or share your health information in the following ways:
For treatment activities
We can use your health information and share it with other professionals who are treating you. For example, we may use and disclose your health information among doctors, nurses, pharmacists, technicians, medical students and other personnel who are involved in taking care of you. We may use or share information about you to coordinate the different services you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. We may disclose information about you to people outside of the OHCA who may be involved in your care, such as family members, home health agencies, therapists, and others. We may provide your health information to your health plan or to another provider to arrange a referral or consultation.
For health care operations activities
We
may use health information to evaluate the quality of services that you received. For example, we may use health information to improve our performance or to find better ways to provide care. We may use health information evaluate the competence of our health care professionals. We may use your health information to decide what additional services we should offer and whether new treatments are effective. We may use and disclose your information to our business associates (described in more detail below) to assist us with evaluating patient outcomes, developing new clinical guidelines, and other activities related to health care operations, including improving health and reducing health care costs. We may disclose information to students and professionals for review and learning purposes. We may combine our health information with information from other health care facilities to compare how we are doing and see where we can make improvements. We may use health information for business planning, or disclose it to attorneys, accountants, consultants and others in order to make sure we are complying with the law. We may remove health information that identifies you so that others may use the de-identified information to study health care and health care delivery without learning who you are. We may use your health information in order to improve artificial intelligence models, so that we are constantly improving the information we provide our users and healthcare. When you are using our services, you are not only learning from people like you, but our services also learn from you and your experiences. Over the long term, this growing repository of health experiences and clinical decision-making will accelerate medical research and improve our understanding of human disease. The information we collect and use in this way is de-identified and cannot be traced back to you.  Overall, these health care operations uses and disclosures help us to develop new tools to assist our health care providers and to provide better health care services to you.
Payment activities
We can use and share your health information to bill and get payment from health plans or other entities. For example, we may use and disclose your health information so that we can receive payment for the treatment and services that were provided. We may share this information with your insurance company or a third party used to process billing information. (As described above, if you pay for your health care in full and out-of-pocket, you may request that we not share your information with your insurance company.) We may contact your insurance company to verify what benefits you are eligible for, to obtain prior authorization, and to tell them about your treatment to make sure that they will pay for your care. We may disclose information to third parties who may be responsible for payment, such as family members, or to bill you. We may disclose information to third parties that help us process payments, such as billing companies, claims processing companies, and collection companies.
To work with our business associates
We
engage with vendors to perform some services on our behalf. For example, we may have a contract with a billing service, or cloud storage provider. These vendors are called our business associates. When we contract for these services, we may disclose your PHI to our business associates so that they can perform the job we have asked them to do. To protect your information, we require all business associates to appropriately safeguard your information and comply with HIPAA.
How else can we use or share your health information?
We are allowed or required to share your information in other ways – usually in ways that contribute to the public good, such as public health and research. We have to meet many conditions in the law before we can share your information for these purposes. For more information please see

You may revoke your authorization in writing at any time, and we will discontinue future uses and disclosures of your health information for the reasons covered by your authorization.
Our Responsibilities

We will let you know promptly if a breach occurs that may have compromised the privacy or security of your information.
We must follow the duties and privacy practices described in this notice and provide you with a copy of it.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC

Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

Third-Party Services
.  We may provide options within the Services where you can receive additional services from a third party.  If you choose to receive services from such third parties, then your personal information will be treated in accordance with those third parties’ privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices.
Information You Share Through Our Services
.  Our Services may enable you to share your personal information with others, including healthcare providers, friends, and contacts via social media, via our Platform, or otherwise.  Please use caution when sharing your personal information with others.  The information you share will be shared according to your instructions and actions, and we have no control over what happens with your personal information once you share it with others.

4) Your Choices Regarding Personal Information
Your Communication Preferences
The following are your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information:
Notifications
.  We may send you push or SMS notifications and similar forms of communication from us, which you can control within the Services. We will not provide your phone number to non-service provider third parties for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
Marketing-related emails from us
.  If you no longer want to receive marketing related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt out by contacting us via the “Contact Us” information above or opting out using the link in the bottom of the email.  Opting out may prevent you from receiving notification including notices regarding updates, improvements, or offers.  Please note that if you opt out of receiving marketing related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages about the Services, from which you cannot opt out.
Your Targeted Advertising Preferences
Targeted Advertising Self-Regulatory Opt-Outs
.  We may work with third-party partners to deliver targeted advertisements based on your interests (also known as “interest-based advertising”).  To opt out of interest-based advertising, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) opt-out page at www.aboutads.info/choices or the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) opt-out page at www.networkadvertising.org/choices.  Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising will not stop you from seeing ads, but the ads will no longer be tailored to your interests.  You may also download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out from participating companies in mobile apps.
Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements through one of these programs, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our services.  Instead, it means that the online ads you do see from relevant program participants should not be based on your interests.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.  In addition, program participants may still use automatic data collection technologies to collect information about your use of our services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the applicable advertising industry program.
Apple/Android
.  You can control whether we can collect your mobile advertising identifier for advertising through settings on your Apple and Android devices.
Cookies
.  To manage cookies, an individual may have the ability to change their browser settings to (for example):  (i) notify them when they receive a cookie, so the individual can choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) automatically reject cookies (or certain types of cookies, such as cookies set by third parties).  Note that similar controls may or may not exist for other tracking technologies, such as pixels, SDKs, and localStorage.  Please check your device or browser settings and related documentation for more information.
Further, note that restricting the use of these technologies might negatively impact an individual’s experience using the Services, as some features or offerings may be less personalized or may not work as otherwise intended. Depending on an individual’s device and operating system, the individual may not be able to delete or block all cookies or other tracking technologies described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if an individual wants to reject cookies across all browsers and devices, the individual will need to do so on each browser and device they use. You may also have options within your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain actions with respect to such emails (e.g., URL clickthroughs).
5) Third-Party Services, Including Payment Service
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which our Services link.  The inclusion of a link on our Services does not imply our endorsement of the linked site or service.
In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with our Platform.
Our Services provide functionality allowing you to make payments using third-party payment services with which you have created your own account.  When you use such a service to make a payment to us, your personal information will be collected by such third party, not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
6. Retention
We will keep your personal information for as long as your user account is active, in order to allow you to have access to your personal information and to provide you with our services.
We may continue to retain your personal information even after you deactivate your user account or stop using the Services, as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes regarding our users, enforce our agreements, or protect our legitimate interests, consistent with applicable law.
7) Security
We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section above.
8) Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is current as of the “Last Updated” date set forth above. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on our Site and App.
U.S. State Privacy Notice

CCPA
”), Colorado Privacy Act, Oregon Consumer Privacy Act), as opposed to sector-specific laws (e.g., HIPAA).
For clarity, this U.S. State Privacy Notice also does not apply to protected health information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“
HIPAA
”).  Once you create an account to become a patient, use the  K Pharmacy services or otherwise use the services of any other member of our
Organized Health Care Arrangement
(“
OHCA
”), all personal information you provide to us through your account while using the Services is subject to the OHCA’s joint HIPAA
Notice of Privacy Practices
.
Your Privacy Rights
Depending on your state of residency, you may exercise the following rights under the State Privacy Laws in relation to the personal information about you that we have collected about you (subject to certain limitations under such laws, such as exceptions in the State Privacy Laws or the inability to verify your identity):
The Right to Access
Under the State Privacy Laws, you have the right to obtain confirmation regarding whether we are processing your personal information and to access that personal information and, in some cases, information about the third parties who may receive such personal information.  You also have the right to access that personal information in a portable, readily usable format, unless not technically feasible to provide in such a format.
Specifically with respect to the CCPA’s right to access, you have the right to request the following: (a) the specific pieces of personal information the business has collected about you and (b) the categories of personal information collected, the sources of collection, the business/commercial purpose for collecting or “selling/sharing” personal information, and the categories of third party to whom the business discloses personal information.
The Right to Deletion
You have the right to request the deletion of personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions under the State Privacy Laws.
The Right to Correction
You have the right to request that inaccuracies in your personal information be corrected, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of your personal information.
Opt-Out Rights
Under State Privacy Laws, you have the right to opt-out of “sales” and “shares” of personal information and “targeted advertising”. A “sale” is defined broadly under State Privacy Laws and includes any disclosure of personal information to a “third party” for any benefit (whether or not the disclosure involves an exchange of money).
We may “sell” your sensitive personal data.  Please read the disclosures below for more details.
As further described in this Privacy Policy, we disclose the following personal information to our advertising/marketing and analytics partners (e.g., advertisers/agencies, publishers such as social media networks, customer analytics/intelligence platforms, adtech partners like exchanges, SSPs, and DSPs) for advertising and marketing purposes, including direct marketing:  identifiers, commercial information, geolocation data, sensitive personal information, and internet or other network information.  Please see our “Your Privacy Choices” link (found in the website footer) to exercise your opt-out rights for “sales”/“shares”/“targeted advertising” and processing of “sensitive personal information” accordingly.
Further:
We do not have actual knowledge of “selling” or “sharing” PI of consumers under sixteen (16) years of age.
We do not engage in “profiling that results in legal or similarly significant effects,” as such is defined under State Privacy Laws.
To Exercise Your Privacy Rights
To submit a request to exercise your right to access, deletion, or correction please email
privacy@khealth.com
.  You may also call us at
888-564-5250
for assistance on exercising rights requests (where State Privacy Laws require that we provide another means for such assistance).
To exercise your right to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” and “targeted advertising,” please click our
Your Privacy Choices
link (found in the Site footer) and follow the instructions therein.  You may also visit our Site with the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal enabled to opt-out of “sales/shares/targeted advertising” (learn more about GPC at
www.globalprivacycontrol.org
).  The “sale/share/targeted advertising” opt-out is on a per-website basis and applies at the browser level for the device you use to opt out.
Unless otherwise prohibited by the State Privacy Laws, we may need to verify your identity and confirm your residency before processing your request.  In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems.  This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address, phone number, or date of last transaction on our Services.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your personal information in our systems.  If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
Non-Discrimination and Appeals
You have the right to not receive “discriminatory” treatment for exercising the rights discussed in the table above.  However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.
Further, under certain State Privacy Laws, you may appeal our decision to not take action on your rights request.  All appeals should be submitted by emailing
privacy@khealth.com
along with a copy of the decision that you are appealing.
Authorized Agents
In certain circumstances under the State Privacy Laws, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf (using the mechanisms for submitting requests above), to the extent we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.
For requests to access, delete, or correct personal information, we may require the following for verification purposes:
a power of attorney from you or your authorized agent that is valid under the laws of the applicable state where you reside; or
sufficient evidence to show that you have:
provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf; and
verified your own identity directly with us or directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.
For requests to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” or the processing of your personal information for “targeted advertising” under the State Privacy Laws, we may require a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
Deidentified Information
Where we process “deidentified information” (as such term is defined under the State Privacy Laws) and are required to keep such information deidentified, we commit to maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, except in instances where necessary for determining whether the deidentification process we used satisfies the requirements under applicable law.
