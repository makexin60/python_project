Hello! Welcome to the Ululab Privacy Policy.
Ululab is a Canadian, Montreal-based company. As creators of educational apps for children, we make it a priority to protect the privacy of our users while they enjoy our games.
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for:
the Ululab website at
www.ululab.com
(intended for adult-use only)
the Ululab mobile applications for kids (Math Makers, Slice Fractions series)
This Privacy Policy is a part of the Terms of Use that explain your rights and responsibilities, as well as Ululab’s, when using our services and sites.
By using our apps and websites, you agree to the handling of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Key Points Upfront
Apart from the purchase of a subscription to Math Makers, or to unlock all in-game content in the Slice Fractions series, there are no in-app purchases.
We are compliant with:
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
,
the Family Educational Rights and Protections Act (FERPA)
,
the General Data Protection and Regulation (GDPR)
.
Math Makers is certified by the
kidSAFE Seal Program
.
Our services do not include any third party advertising.
Our practices with regard to data relating to children are particularly strict, as we describe below. Most personal data collection is restricted to parents only, apart from User Generated Content.
When a parent creates a profile, we ask you to submit the age of your child, to ensure we produce content that is age appropriate (in terms of difficulty level).
You can request a copy to review and delete the information Ululab has collected about you anytime through an email to
info@ululab.com
.
What Information We Collect
We collect the following data from adults:
email address
chosen password
device type and OS version
cookies on the Ululab website
IP address
Android Advertising ID
information about subscription validity
We collect the following data from teachers:
email address
device type and OS version
IP address
Some of this information is voluntarily provided, like an email address. Other information is collected automatically, like your device type. We may also use cookies or web beacons to personalize content and ads (not in-app) and to analyze our services.
Through the game, we collect the following non-personal information from players:
Unique PlayerID
Device type and version
Achievements
Time spent playing
Other information about game usage, such as progress in the game
Math Makers collects user generated content from kids when they use the creative mode. The levels they create are saved on our servers, and may be shared publicly if they choose.
How We Collect and Process Your Information
We collect and process personal data when adults voluntarily:
Download the Math Makers App:
When you first download and access the parents’ section of our apps, we collect technical information and technical identifiers such as device type and OS version. We use it for testing our IT systems and analyzing data in order to improve the user experience.
Launch the Math Makers App:
When you first launch the Math Makers app, your IP address is sent to our third party attribution platform called AppsFlyer, to record installs of our apps in relation to the parent experience, and to track whether a purchase was made (
www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy
). We are using a limited version of this plugin called Strict Mode, which was specifically built for kid’s apps. This plugin collects the IP address, which they then also share with Meta, to tell if you came from an ad or not (
https://www.facebook.com/policy.php
). The location information is parsed out, and hashed (encrypted). It will remain hashed until you register.
We are also using a third party attribution platform called Firebase, specifically Google Analytics for Firebase. The only personal information collected by Firebase is users’ emails when they register within the app. Emails are ‘hashed’, a multi step encryption process that keeps the data secure. Firebase is unable to identify a user with these emails, unless the email registered with is an email that’s been used to register for any other Google service in the past. The service does collect and store information such as number of sessions per user, session duration, operating system, device models, geography, first launches, and app updates. We use the information sent to Firebase to know whether or not a purchase was made and to know if it results from ads campaigns we made. We also send Unique Player IDs to Firebase, so that we can later identify a user in Firebase if they request an account deletion within the app. To find more about what information Google collects, how it uses this information and how to control the information sent to Google, please see the following page:

Register as a parent to the Math Makers service:
We manage personal and non personal data through Microsoft Azure, PlayFab, RevenueCat and Amazon Web Services live ops back-end platform.
This data is needed in order to manage your account and make your account progress available on multiple devices. This data includes Unique PlayerID, Login Data, Registration Date and Game Specific Data, such as game progress, history of sessions, presence in game, etc. A masked IP address (with the fourth part hidden) is collected to infer an imprecise location. We also collect technical information about the device to troubleshoot technical issues.
We ask for a parent email address and a chosen password, in order to ensure only you have access to your account and data. Your email will also be used for communications related to relevant Math Makers content and your Math Makers account in the form of a newsletter. You can unsubscribe to this at any time through a link in the newsletter.
That data is backed up on Microsoft Azure (
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/trusted-cloud/privacy/
) on a server that only Ululab can access.

Additional Protections and information for School Accounts
Educational Use and Student Data. We collect a bare minimum of personally identifiable information (Personal Information as defined below) from the parents and teachers as necessary for students to establish an account. For school accounts and school-based services, a school administrator or educator signs up for a school account, whereupon we collect the administrator’s or educator’s name, email address, school name, city, number of students, age range and location. An educator sets up basic access for students. Students are only identified by a number, and then associated with the teacher for their work through the Services (student names and their work on the Services are collectively, “Student Data”). The Services allow the students to play levels and interact with the Services but only in a de-identified way. Students who use the Creative Mode feature can submit their own levels.
With respect to student data in particular, We commit to protect student data additionally as follows:
Student data collected from our Services is evaluated and used only to provide the Services and for use and benefit of the students, schools, and parents only. ACCORDINGLY, ULULAB WILL NOT USE ANY STUDENT DATA IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES.
We commit to maintaining the confidentiality and security of all student data in accordance with all applicable state and U.S. federal regulations, including, without limitation, the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”)
.
Ululab will not sell or lease any student data for any advertising, marketing, or other purposes.
We will delete, or if requested by the educational institution, transfer to the educational institution, all respective student data within 90 days (or a shorter time if required by applicable law) following termination of our agreement with the educational institution
Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Services and you do so at your own risk. All information, including your personally identifiable information, may be maintained on servers or databases located outside your state or country or to a jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location.
If you are located outside of America, please be advised that we process and store information in America and your use of our Services constitutes your consent to and understanding of this processing.
