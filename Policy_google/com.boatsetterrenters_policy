Boatsetter Privacy Policy
Last modified: February 28, 2022
Boatsetter, a provider of a peer-to-peer boat charter marketplace, is committed to protecting your privacy and informing you about how your personal information is used.
Our Privacy Policy helps explain our information practices. For example, we talk about what information we collect, use, and disclose about visits to our Services. We also collect information by other means (including offline) or from other sources, such as the equipment on boat you may rent.
When we say “Boatsetter,” “our,” “we,” or “us,” we’re talking about Collaborative Boating, Inc., and its affiliates. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of www.boatsetter.com, and any other websites, applications, features, software or services provided, owned, or operated by Boatsetter that link to this Privacy Policy (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise. Please also read Boatsetter’s Terms of Service Agreement (“Terms”), which describes the terms under which you use our Services; capital terms used below that are not defined in this Privacy Policy are taken from the Terms.
In the event of conflict or inconsistency between the Privacy Policy, and the Terms, the order of precedence will be: the Privacy Policy, and the Terms.
Change
We may modify this Privacy Policy, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the updated Privacy Policy.
Information we collect
Boatsetter receives or collects information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services. We may also ask for your consent to process your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you. When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop processing of your data for that purpose.
Information You Provide
Account Registration Information. To create an account, you provide data including your name, email, address, age, and your mobile phone number. You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile name, and profile picture.
Identity Verification. When you register with us or send a mobile text message to Boatsetter’s short code we may collect your instant messages (“IM”) screen name.  A verification message may be sent to your mobile phone number, email address, and/or IM screen name and we require that you verify each piece of contact information.
Rental. When you rent or charter a boat, we may ask for, and store, your credit card number or billing information.  We may also collect additional information from you such as your driving and criminal conviction history, loss history, and other information related to our underwriting process.  We may also require that you grant us permission to check your driver’s record in order to confirm you meet Boatsetter’s eligibility standards (e.g., age). You authorize us to access your driver’s record from state DMVs, RMVs, and other applicable entities and you authorize those entities to release this information to Boatsetter.
Mobile.  When you download or use apps created by Boatsetter, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device.  We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.
Communication.  To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from us if your computer supports such capabilities.  We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, sometimes in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to you. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please adjust your
notification settings
in your Boatsetter Account.
In-Boat Hardware.  If a GPS tracking device is installed in a boat, and you activate that device with Boatsetter, we may gather information about your use of the boat, including time of use, location, speed of travel, and more.  When you rent or charter a boat, and the boat includes a GPS tracking device enabled by the owners of the boat, those owners may be able to see the location of the boat during the rental or charter period. Your location information may be released to insurance companies, law enforcement, or similar parties when investigating claims, providing you with help, or when required by law or legal process.
Listing Information.  You have choices about the information on a listing profile, such as the city, a description of the boat, harbor where the boat is located.  The information on your listing profile helps you get more from our Services, but it is your decision whether to post sensitive information. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.  If you own a boat that is listed with Boatsetter, we may require that you provide evidence of an inspection, survey of the boat, or, in addition, a boat history report. Listing a boat with us provides us authorization to obtain history about your boat and inspection records from other parties (e.g., mechanics, inspection companies), as well as consent for those parties to release records to us.
Customer Support. You may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, and how to contact you so we can provide you customer support. For example, you may send us an email with information relating to a rental transaction.
Automatically Collected Information
Usage and Log Information. We collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (such as how you use our Services, how you interact with others using our Services, and the like), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports.
Transactional Information. If you pay for items available via our Services, we may receive information and confirmations, such as payment receipts, including from other third parties processing your payment.

Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, such as your desired rental location, and otherwise to customize our Services for you.  Additionally, third-party advertisers and other organizations may use their own cookies to collect information about your activities on the Services and/or the advertisements you have clicked on. This information may be used by them to serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on the content you have viewed. Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements. We do not control these cookies. To disable or reject third-party cookies, please refer to the relevant third party’s website.

Third Party Information
Information Others Provide About You. We receive information other people provide us, which may include information about you.
Third-Party Providers. We work with third-party providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with companies to distribute our apps, provide our infrastructure, supply map and places information, process payments, help us understand how people use our Services, and market our Services. These providers may provide us information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.
Third-Party Services. We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services. For example, you can register to join by logging into online accounts you may have with third parties, such as Facebook, Google, or Apple (“Third-Party Accounts”).  As part of the Services, you may link your Boatsetter Account with Third Party Accounts, and if you decide to register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Services, we will obtain information you have provided to the Third Party Account (such as name, email, profile picture, or names of your friends).  You understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Account, you are authorizing us to make available and store the information in your Third Party Account, as well as authorizing us to share information with the Third Party Account on your behalf. For example, we may send your information to a company called Cognito to verify your identity before booking a Boat.  Please note that when you use third-party services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services.
Boatsetter will rely on legal grounds to process your personal information to the extent permitted by applicable law, which may include, without limitation:  to honor contractual commitments, to take steps in anticipation of entering into contract, to fulfill legal obligations, your consent, and Boatsetter’s legitimate interests.
