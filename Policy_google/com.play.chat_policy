aMurmur Privacy Policy
Date of Last Revision: Sep 14, 2021
aMurmur(" "we," "us," or "our") takes the private nature of your information very
    seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the "Privacy Policy") describes how we treat the
    information we collect when you visit and use our website FunShare.co and the aMurmur Mobile Applications (collectively
    the "Site") and/or aMurmur's other domains, products, advertising products, services, and/or content,
    including our mobile applications (collectively with the Site, the "Services"). When you use the Services,
    you also consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information
    as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This
    Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we
    share with our partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own,
    control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses
    (collectively “Third Party Services”). While we try to work only with those Third Party Services that share our
    respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party
    Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.
What We Collect and How We Use It
Account Information:
Certain visitors to aMurmur’s services choose to interact with aMurmur in ways that require aMurmur to gather
    personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that aMurmur gathers depends on the nature of
    the interaction. Some of our services require you to set up a basic aMurmur account, so we need to collect a few
    important details about you, such as: a username, a password, an email address, a phone number, full name, display
    name, moniker (pseudonym), profile pictures, etc. We may use your phone number to verify your Account and if you
    provide aMurmur with your phone number, you agree to receive missed calls / text messages to that number from aMurmur.
    Additionally, our customer service may contact and communicate with you, if necessary. We may use your email address
    to verify your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below.
We may use Account Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such
    as by personalization.
You can keep yourself fairly anonymous on aMurmur, but remember that your posts, comments, shares, username, etc are
    all visible to the public by default.
Email Communications with Us:
As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative
    communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered
    part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send you
    other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of by using the “Opt-Out” link or via an alternate method as mentioned
    in the emails themselves.
Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account Information; if you receive
      such an email, please forward it to us.
We send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on aMurmur, and ones with important information about your
    account. You can opt out of the former, but not the latter.
Information about Your Account on Third Party Services:
You can link your Account to certain Third Party Services. In order to do so, you may provide us with your username
    or other user ID for a Third Party Services, and you may then be required to log into that Service. After you
    complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that Third Party
    Services so that we can, for example, post your content to that Third Party Services when you ask us to. We do not
    receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Services accounts. Additionally, you may link your Facebook,
    Twitter, etc account to aMurmur, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (such as your friends or
    contacts). The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so
    be sure to check what those are.
Information Obtained from Third Party Services:
In some cases, we partner with Third Party Services that may provide information about you. Such information could
    include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that Third Party Services and made it
    available for aMurmur to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use it to develop new Services or to
    improve or enhance the Services.
When you connect other Third Party Services to your aMurmur account, those Third Party Services might share
    information about you with us. What gets shown to us is determined by their privacy policies.
User Content:
By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you provide us with content it is published so
    that anyone can view it. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines.
    In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions
    or features native to the Services, such as Sharing, Resharing, forwarding, etc.
At its core, aMurmur is a public platform. Don’t be afraid to share amazing things, but do understand that it can be
    hard to completely remove things from the internet once they’ve been shared or reshared a few times.
Native Actions:
The Services allow you to perform native actions that are integral to our products, such as liking a post,
    commenting in a post, sharing a post, replying to a post, etc. Liking, sharing, and replying are public actions –
    anyone can expand the “activities” view on a post, for example, to see who liked, shared, or replied to a post. We
    use information about native actions to improve the Services, develop new Services, and, particularly, to
    personalize your aMurmur experience. Personalization using this information may include presenting you with new posts
    relevant to what you’ve liked, providing you with better search results, and showing you advertising more relevant
    to your interests
When you share information or content like text, photos, videos, gifs, etc as well as shares, likes, replies,
    comments, etc via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.
Information About User Content:
In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, if the recipient
    has viewed the content, replayed the content, and the metadata that is provided with the content. When it's
    included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings, or EXIF
    information. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.
Camera and Photos
Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. We’ll
    access your camera and photos only after you give us your consent.
Information Related to Use of the Services:
These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application or other Internet service, certain information is almost
    always created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our products. We collect information about
    how people use the Services, including those with an Account. This type of information may be collected in our log
    files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services. We use internal tools and third party
    applications and services (like Google Analytics, etc) to collect and analyze this information. Some of this
    information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”) used to access the Services;
    some may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical
    measure that wouldn’t identify you or your Account). We also collect your IP Address when you make a post or perform
    actions like commenting, sharing, etc. We may use this information about how you and others interact with the
    Services for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services,
    including but not limited to: providing users with personalized content; providing users with targeted advertising;
    improving our search results; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and
    generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons as set forth in “Information
    Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.”
We use information about how you interact with aMurmur in order to personalize it for you, to keep both you and our
    community safe from harm, and to improve aMurmur for everyone who uses it.
Information Related to Your Web Browser:
We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as
    your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language
    preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make to
    the Services, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser
    (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that
    information in a manner associated with your Account. We use web browser-related information to enhance and improve
    the Services.
Information Related to Your Mobile Device:
We may collect and store information related to your mobile device. We may also ask you to provide your phone
    number to enable new products and improve the Services, such as by enabling multi-factor authentication for Account
    login.
Information Collected Using Cookies:
A cookie, also known as a web cookie, browser cookie, and HTTP cookie, is a piece of text stored by a user's
    web browser.
    A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to
    share with us if you fill in a contact form or email us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies, and delete
    existing ones. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to
    decline cookies if you prefer. The help section of your chosen browser or it’s accompanying website will provide
    instructions on how to accept, decline and delete cookies.
Declining cookies may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website, however, as some functionality like
    login, etc may not work.
Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others
Some services that we use (including Third Party Services such as Advertising partners, Analytics partners, etc),
    such as Google Analytics, etc may also place their own cookies (or by similar technologies) on your browser. These
    cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
    information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
    deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Note that, unless otherwise
    disclosed, this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third
    parties.
Information About Your Contacts:
Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists, so that we can connect you with
    people in our Services that are also on those contact lists. We may, with your consent collect information from your
    device’s phonebook. As an example, you can send us your mobile phone contact information through our mobile
    applications, which then allows us to provide you with a list of those contacts that use the Services so that you
    can “follow” them. As another example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about
    you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook
How we Share Information
We may share information about you in the following ways:
Information Shared with the Public Through the Services:
As noted in “User Content” and “Native Actions,” above, by default, content published through the Services and many
    actions you take on the Services are shared with the public. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone
    and may be indexed by search engines, you should be careful about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure
    it’s information you want to share with everyone.
The content you create on aMurmur is, by default, public. This means that anyone can see it, and that search engines
    can index it.
User Consent or Direction:
We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or
    application to access your account.
Information You Share with Third Party Services:
The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or be a
    co-branded or third-party-branded service that’s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to
    those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be
    providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You may also choose
    to share information that you provide to us, like posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by sharing
    posts to Twitter or Facebook). That’s where our Privacy Policy ends and their policies begin. Make sure you are
    comfortable with the policies of any services you’re considering sharing to before connecting them to your aMurmur
    account. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your
    information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that
    you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services. This Privacy Policy only
    governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services'
    privacy policies.
Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services:
In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as service
    providers, consultants, and other agents (collectively "Agents"), for the purposes of operating,
    enhancing, and improving the Services, and developing new products and services. For example, we may share
    information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to
    information in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for
    these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do
    not have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to
    assist us.
Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user information is typically
    one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we
    go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired
    by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may
    continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:
We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless
    legal demands. That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we
    reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process,
    governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our terms and conditions,
    including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security,
    trust and safety, or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
    the purposes of improving security and preventing fraud, spam, and malware), (iv) respond to user support requests,
    or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general.
Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request:
If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly
    burdensome.
To Service Providers Performing Services on Our Behalf:
We may contract with third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including but not limited to
    marketing assistance, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service, and data analysis. We require any third
    party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and are not permitted
    to use your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide services to aMurmur.
Information Shared with Our Payment Providers in Order to Complete the Payment and Refund:
If you choose to Buy Coins or conduct other payment related transactions, we may share data with the relevant
    payment
    provider to facilitate this transaction. For Coin transactions, we share a transaction ID to enable us to identify
    you
    and credit your account with the correct value in coins once you have made the payment.
If you initiate a refund request for an in-app purchase from an application or payment provider’s website, we will
    provide the following data as required by the payment provider to determine whether your refund request can be
    approved：
The age of your account.
The UUID of the in-app user account that completed the consumable in-app purchase transaction.
The extent to which you consumed the in-app purchase.
Whether the app successfully delivered an in-app purchase that works properly.
The total amount of in-app purchases you have made in your app, across all platforms.
The total amount of refunds you have received, in your app, across all platforms.
The platform on which you consumed the in-app purchase.
The amount of time that you used the app.
The status of your account.
Other information requested by the payment provider.
Information Shared with Other Third Parties:
We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-personally identifying
    information with people and entities that we do business with.
The Security of Your Information
Your Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We may enable additional
    security features in the future, like multi-factor authentication. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your
    Account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer
    and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
    disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing
    practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against
    unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
We seek to protect your information (including your Account Information) to ensure that it is kept private;
    However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We can't guarantee the
    security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may
    compromise the security of user information at any time.
What Information You Can Access
If you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging into the
    Services and checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies
    through their web browser settings.
Our policy towards children
This Website is not intended for children under the age of 12 and we do not knowingly collect any Personal
    Information from such children. Children under the age of 12 should not use our Website or our Services at any time.
    In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from children under the age of
    12, we will use reasonable efforts to erase such information from our records.
How to Delete Your Account and Data
If you want to delete your Account and Data, you can do so by emailing us at support@amurmur.app and providing
    proof
    of authority over the Account. What constitutes "proof of authority" will vary depending on the
    circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying information so that we can be confident you
    are the Account owner.
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the legal basis relied upon and as
    permitted by
    applicable law.
You may permanently delete your Account and Data at any time.
When your Account is deactivated, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the
    App. For up to
    28 days, it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
    After 28 days,
    we begin the process of deleting your personal information from our systems, unless:
we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make purchases within the App, some
      personal data
      may need to be kept for accounting purposes);
we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law;
there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is
      resolved; or
the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing
      Users’ safety
      and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe
      behaviour or
      security incidents from opening a new account.
Where aMurmur uses machine learning, for example, to help us detect and prevent fraudulent card transactions,
    and to
    detect and prevent spam communications on the App (as explained above), we may need to keep personal
    information for a
    longer period than the retention periods explained above, to enable the machine learning to work properly.
    Where this is
    the case, we always seek to minimise the amount of personal information that is used and we ensure that it
    is
    ring-fenced and kept securely from other User personal information. We regularly review the period for which
    personal
    information is required for machine learning purposes and delete any identifiable information when it is no
    longer
    required.
To prevent abuse and/or misuse of aMurmur by a User following termination or deletion of a profile/Account we
    shall
    retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that User does not open
    a new
    Account and profile in breach of our Terms and Conditions of Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and
    regulations.
Warning:
Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies of that
    information may
    still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or
    copied or
    stored by others. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third
    party
    applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent
    permitted
    under their terms of service or privacy policies.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of
    your information. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will attempt to
    notify you and other users of the Site by sending a notice to the email address or similar contact provided to us
    and/or by placing a notice on our Site. You should periodically check the Site for such notices. By continuing to
    access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy
    Policy.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

X Privacy Policy
Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:
X is a public platform
Learn what’s viewable & searchable
We collect some data
about you
Learn what we collect & how
Affiliate services may have their own policies
Learn about affiliates
We use your data to make X better
Learn how we make your info work
You can control your experience
Learn how to update your settings
If you have questions about how we use data, just ask

10. How To Contact X
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us.
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
Personal Accounts.
If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
Professional Accounts.
If you create a
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.
Payment Information.
In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
Preferences.
When you set your preferences using your
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
Biometric Information.
Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.
Job Applications / Recommendations.
We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your activity on X, including:
Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.
We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).
Purchase and payments.
To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
Device Information.
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:
Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.
Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.
Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information.
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.
Inferred Identity.
We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:
When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.
When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.
Log Information.
We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:
IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identiﬁers; and identiﬁers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.
Advertisements.
When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).
Cookies and similar technologies.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.
3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether
videos you upload
are downloadable by others.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates
and third-party partners and
service providers
located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.
X is a
participant
in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us
here
. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body
JAMS
, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in
Annex 1
to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF
here
.
