Your privacy in HERE WeGo, HERE application and HERE Maps
What’s new?
GDPR: The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), a new European Union (EU) data protection law, takes effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR gives individuals in the EU more control over how their data is used and places certain obligations on businesses that process personal information of those individuals. We’ve updated our Privacy Policy to take into account the new requirements of the GDPR.
Transparency: We’ve provided additional transparency in relation to our processing of your personal data in context of the Service. However, this update does not change the manner in which we process your personal data.
Your rights: You have the ability to access, request for download and deletion of your personal information.
HERE’s Privacy Policy
explains how we process your personal data when you use our products and services. In addition, the following information applies to your use of HERE WeGo, HERE application or HERE Maps (the “Service”).The purpose of this document is to give background information on data processing for different features available in the Service. The features of the Service enable you to find places and addresses on a map, interact with them and access relevant content, as well as locate yourself on a map. With navigation you are able to find the optimal route to your destination, even inside buildings. You can relive and share your location experiences with your friends on different Social Networking Services (“SNS”).
We encourage you to familiarise yourself with the privacy policies of third party services, when you interact with them. HERE is not in control or responsible for the contents and features of those services.
Please understand that the features of the Service may depend on how you access the Service. Different device models and software versions of the Service may offer different features.
What information do we collect?
We collect the following categories of information:
Registration and contact details
Some features may require the use of HERE account, for example when you want to synchronise your collections. You may continue to use the other features of the Service without signing in.
When you are logged in with your HERE account, we will try to automatically synchronise your recent searches and your collections in association with your HERE account.
Location data and place information
Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (“Location Data”) and information about places (“Place Information”). Location Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been. Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as Assisted GPS. In many device models the user interface of the Service identifies the use of positioning with an icon. Place Information is general information pertaining to particular geographical location (e.g. city or a location of a restaurant) that you may have provided to us, for example your collections.
Unless otherwise stated, we use random identifiers in connection with your Location Data that do not identify you personally.
When you start to use the Service, the applicable Service activates your selected positioning methods to retrieve your current location.
The Service may send your Location Data to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as ask information about nearby services or offerings, use search features, as well as when the Service asks for new maps for new areas you have navigated into. As further defined below, Location Data may be collected when you use the traffic feature for service improvement purposes without identifying you personally. Place Information may be sent to HERE for example when you synchronise your collections.
Information about Service usage
You may participate to improving our services. See
Your privacy in the HERE Improvement Program
for more details.
The Service may include HERE-provided positioning services, including Wi-Fi or other network-based positioning methods. The use of these technologies and positioning services may involve sharing any or all of the following with HERE: Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp; number of satellites used in positioning; parameters of nearby mobile network towers; parameters of nearby Wi-Fi routers and/or Bluetooth® beacons; Mobile Country Code and Mobile Network Code of your mobile subscription. This information is sent to us when you use the Service online, after which it is deleted from your device. We do not use this data to identify you personally or combine this information with your HERE account.
When you decide to use the traffic features of the Service, Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp are sent from your device to HERE to detect traffic jams, traffic patterns, changed road conditions and other such conditions so that we can provide you with better service. This information is analysed to distinguish independent routes and traffic patterns and contains an identifier, which is persistent for the duration of the route.
You may choose the extent to which you contribute to the improvement of our services. In the context of traffic features of the Service, you can provide us with the Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp, along with the changing identifier, either when you use the Service, when the Service is not actively used or even when the applicable Service is closed. If the app is closed, we’ll attempt to detect when you’re driving to enable the background collection. We may use methods available from the mobile operating system or other contextual information to detect driving scenarios. You can always change your preferences in the app settings either in Settings or About.
This information is sent to us when you use the Service online, after which it is deleted from your device. We do not use this data to identify you personally or combine or otherwise associate this information with your HERE account.
Technical information and your transactions
When you use the Service online, certain technical information such as the type of your mobile device, unique device or network service provider identifiers, internet protocol address, time zone, technical details of your client as well as your transactions with HERE may be automatically collected by HERE.
Our uses of your data
Non-personal use of Location Data or Place Information
We do not associate your Location Data or Place Information with your other personally identifiable information, such as HERE account, unless you have asked us to do so. For example, if you save a place to your collection, we do not combine this information with your Location Data unless you have asked us to do so. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent associating your Location Data with other personally identifiable information without your permission.
Provision and development of the Service
The information collected by the Service is used to provide you with the Service and to develop our products and services.
Communicate with you and make recommendations
We may also use this information to communicate with you and provide you with more improved search and recommendations to better assist you to find a place you may like.
Location based advertising
The Service may include provision of location based advertising or other similar content. You may be positioned separately for this purpose. For example if you ask for weather information you may be served with advertising content tailored to that location.
The Service may also include behaviourally profiled advertisements. For the purposes of provisioning relevant advertisements to you, we may share your device specific advertising ID to advertising networks. We use a third party company called MoPub to deliver ads to you. The MoPub SDK collects information about your device while you use the Service. This information may include, but is not limited to, your device identifier, model and related configuration (such as screen size), mobile operator as well as IP address. In addition, we provide you with means to increase the relevance of the advertising you see in the app by sharing your location with the advertising network. If you wish not to share your location with the advertising network, you can choose do so in the app settings under ‘Location-based ads’. If you wish to change your settings related to behaviourally profiled advertising, you can always do so from your device settings. Note that in any case you may still receive ads, but just not profiled.
What is our legal basis for processing your Personal Data?
We process your personal data in context of the Service for the following legal bases:
Performance of a contract with you
We process your personal data to perform our obligations under the Service Terms.
Your consent
This Service enables you to activate additional optional features and/or functionalities and help us improve the Service, including Traffic, HERE Improvement Program and related search improvement.
Once you activate an optional feature or functionality, we process your personal data based on your consent. You may revoke your consent, at any time, by changing your settings in Settings or About. Doing so will bar us from processing of your personal data based on your consent from that day onward, but will not impact the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data based on your consent before it was withdrawn. Please note that some of the features in the Service may only be available to you based on consent.
How long do we retain Personal Data?
We endeavor to only collect personal data that are necessary for the purposes for which they are collected, and to retain such data for no longer than is necessary for such purposes. The length of time personal data is retained, and criteria for determining that time, are dependent on the nature of the personal data and the purpose for which it was provided. For example, your personal data related to managing your account (such as name, email address, and account content and preferences) are maintained for as long as they are retained by you within your account. Other data, such as records of your activity within the Service (as applicable), are typically maintained only for a short period before being anonymized. You may contact the HERE Privacy Office at
privacy@HERE.com
to obtain additional information about retention of your personal data.
Your choices
The Service offers a variety of choices to allow you to control how your Location Data and other information are collected.
You may use the Service in offline or online mode. No Location Data or other information is sent to HERE if you only use the Service in offline mode. In offline mode, your device will also not interact with the advertising networks. Note, that your device may nevertheless continue to store and have already stored information which may be sent to HERE as defined earlier in this document and if you participate to HERE Improvement Program or have enabled traffic feature. Note also that you may still receive ads, in case such ads have been cached in the device prior to switching the device into offline mode.
You can choose the level at which you participate in the development of HERE’s products and services. You may separately turn the
HERE Improvement Program
and traffic on and off.
You can only enable the traffic features if you also contribute to the improvement of our services. Once enabled, you can choose the extent to which you contribute to the improvement of our services: only when the app is running or when the app is running or closed. Please note that you may be able to independently turn the traffic layer on and off. This only impacts the visualization of the traffic content.
You can switch positioning services on and off using your device settings. Device positioning settings also control HERE positioning services. If you configure your device such that you are not using any assisted positioning methods, HERE positioning services will also not be used.
You can choose to share your location with advertising networks to provide you with more location-relevant advertisements. You can always turn this on and off in the app settings.
You may also clear your recent searches and destinations from the local storage of the Service. Clearing local storage will also clear already synchronised recent searches in the next synchronization instance.
Information sharing

Your privacy in Automotive navigation from HERE
The purpose of this document is to provide information on the processing of your personal data in connection with your use of the Automotive navigation system and its features (the “Service”).
The features of the Service enable you for example to navigate from one place to another, find places and addresses on a map, interact with them and access relevant content, as well as synchronize information related to your drives to access from other screens and devices. You can share places, routes and arrival times with your friends. The Service also helps you to optimize your daily commute by learning your habits.
This document applies to the following elements that the Service can include depending on the vehicle’s make, model and the navigation system in use:
- the in-vehicle navigation system,
- the online account which enables you to plan your route in advance and sync it with your vehicle, and
- the navigation or route planning mobile device application which continues to guide you outside of your vehicle.
The Service includes experiences designed for use by a driver as well as other users of the vehicle, such as co-drivers or passengers, passengers. It is your responsibility to ensure that this information along with applicable terms is passed on to such other users.
1. Categories of data we process
We collect the following categories of information:
1.1 Registration and contact details
Some features may require the use of HERE account, for example when you want to synchronize your collections. When you register, we collect your registration credentials and settings such as country/region and language preference. You may continue to use the other features of the Service without signing in. When you are logged in with your HERE account, we will try to automatically synchronize your recent searches and your collections in association with your HERE account.
1.2 Location Data and Place Information
Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (“Location Data”) and information about places (“Place Information”). Location Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been. Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as GPS. In many device models the user interface of the Service identifies the use of positioning with an icon. Place Information is general information pertaining to particular geographical location (e.g. city or a location of a restaurant) that you may have provided to us, for example your collections or saved destinations.
Unless otherwise stated, we use random identifiers in connection with your Location Data that do not identify you personally.
When you start to use the Service, the applicable Service activates your selected positioning methods to retrieve your current location. The Service may send your Location Data to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as ask information about nearby services or offerings, use search features, as well as when the Service asks for new maps for new areas you have navigated into. As further described below, Location Data may be collected when you use the traffic feature for service improvement purposes without identifying you personally.
Place Information may be sent to HERE for example when you synchronize your favorites across devices.
1.3 Traffic Improvement
Whenever you use the Service while having traffic features enabled, the Service sends, in regular intervals, your current location, speed, direction and timestamp to us to provide you and other users of the Service with better traffic service such as detect traffic jams, traffic patterns, changed road conditions and other such conditions as well as to identify new routes on the map. This information is analyzed to distinguish independent routes and traffic patterns and contains a changing identifier, which is persistent only for the duration of the route. This information is sent to us when you use the Service online. In case you are using the Service offline, we may collect this information locally on device and it may be sent to us on your next connection.
1.4 My commute
You may activate My Commute feature in the Service to let the Service learn your daily commutes and help you optimize your travel. While learning your daily commutes, the Service can start recommending optimal times for travel based on foreseen traffic situation. All the information collected by the My Commute feature, which includes information about the routes you’ve driven and places related to your commute remains only in the vehicle and is never sent outside the vehicle. Information is stored protected against unauthorized use.
You may manage your learned routes and preferences and you may turn the My Commute feature on and off via settings of the Service.
1.5 Technical information and your transactions
When you use the Service online, certain technical information such as the details of the application version, service permissions, vehicle identification number, internet protocol address, time zone, technical details of your device and connection as well as your transactions with HERE may be automatically collected by HERE.

2.2. Developing and improving our products and services
We process your data to provide you and other users with better Service such as improving search and recommendations, better assisting you to find a place you may like or detect new routes on the map.
For this purpose, we use the traffic information collected from your drives in an anonymous manner. We do not associate your Location Data or Places Information with your other personally identifiable information, such as an InControl Navigation Account, unless you have asked us to do so. For example, we do not combine your Place Information such as favorite, recent or shared destinations with your Location Data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent associating your Location Data with other personally identifiable information without your permission.

You may choose to enable and disable the synchronization or your favourites as well as your most recent location of your car.
If you have enabled the synchronization of the location of your parked car, the Service will automatically, or upon request, send the parked car location in association with each and every active InControl Navigation Account on the vehicle.

Your privacy in HERE Tracking reference apps
HERE’s Privacy Policy
explains how we process your personal data when you use our products and services. In addition, the following information applies to your use of HERE Tracking reference apps (the “Service”).The purpose of this document is to give background information on data processing for different features available in the Service. The features of the Service enable you to monitor and track different kinds of assets (“Asset”), which can report their location and other supplementary information to HERE Tracking Service, oversee the current location of the Asset, request for update of the status of the Asset, define a geofence for the Asset and make the Asset report on any changes in relation to the geofence (such as “entered the geofence” and “left the geofence”). You may also be able to assign other users capabilities to oversee the Assets.
We encourage you to familiarise yourself with the privacy policies of third party services, when you interact with them. HERE is not in control or responsible for the contents and features of those services.
Please understand that the features of the Service may depend on how you access the Service. Different device models and software versions of the Service may offer different features.
What information do we collect?
We collect the following categories of information:
Registration and contact details
Some features may require the use of HERE account, for example when you want to associate an Asset to your account. The only way for you to claim ownership of an Asset is to assignthat Asset to your HERE account.
When you are logged in with your HERE account, we will try to automatically synchronise your Assets associated with your HERE account.
Location data and place information
Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (“Location Data”) and the location of the Assets you are overseeing (“Asset Location”). Location Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been. Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as Assisted GPS. In many device models the user interface of the Service identifies the use of positioning with an icon.
Asset Location relates to the location of your assigned Assets. Asset Location is based on available positioning methods, such as WiFi based positioning, Bluetooth based positioning and/or cell-tower based positioning or GPS.
When you start to use the Service application or activate the Asset, the application and the Asset activates your selected positioning methods to retrieve your current location.
The Service as well as the Asset may send your Location Data or Asset Location to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as request status of the Assets, or receive or send notifications or instructions from the Assets.
Note that to instantaneously request status of the Asset, we may need to send an SMS to the Asset. This can only be performed if you register the phone number of the Asset with HERE Tracking Service
You may simulate the behaviour of Assets by using HERE Tracker application, available from application stores for both Android and iPhone devices. The HERE Tracker application turns your mobile phone into an Asset, and starts reporting the location of your device (as an Asset) to the Service, on intervals configured by you. The reporting only takes place from the moment onwards once you have assigned your device (as an Asset) to the Service and your HERE account.
Information about Service usage
The Service as well as the Asset may include HERE-provided positioning services, including Wi-Fi or other network-based positioning methods. The use of these technologies and positioning services may involve sharing any or all of the following with HERE: Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp; number of satellites used in positioning; parameters of nearby mobile network towers; parameters of nearby Wi-Fi routers and/or Bluetooth® beacons; Mobile Country Code and Mobile Network Code of your mobile subscription. This information is sent to us when you use the Service or Asset online, after which it is deleted from your device.
Technical information and your transactions
When you use the Service or Asset online, certain technical information such as the type of your device, unique device or network service provider identifiers, internet protocol address, time zone, technical details of your client as well as your transactions with HERE may be automatically collected by HERE.
