Additional Disclosures Related to the Collection, Use, Disclosure and Sale of Personal Information
Collection and Use of Personal Information
: In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers, characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law, commercial information, Internet or other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, audio, electronic, visual or similar information, professional or employment-related information, inferences drawn about you, and other categories of personal information that relate to or are reasonably capable of being associated with you. For examples of the precise data points we collect and the sources of such collection, please see “
Collection of Information
” above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in “
Use of Information
” above.
Disclosure of Personal Information
: We may share your personal information with third parties as described in the “
Sharing of Information
” section above. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for business or commercial purposes: identifiers, commercial information, Internet or other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, and inferences.
Sale of Personal Information
: California law requires that we provide transparency about, and allow consumers to opt out of, any “sales” of their personal information” which for the purposes of the CCPA broadly means scenarios in which TouchTunes has shared personal information with third parties in exchange for valuable consideration. Although TouchTunes previously “sold” certain personal information, we no longer sell personal information as defined by the CCPA. In the preceding 12 months, we have “sold” the following categories of personal information: identifiers, geolocation data, and inferences. At no point in time have we sold personal information about any consumer whom we knew to be under the age of 16.
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request (1) more information about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected, sold and disclosed for a business purpose in the last 12 months and (2) deletion of your personal information. You may make these requests by emailing us at
mobileconsumersupport@touchtunes.com
.  Once we receive your request, we will verify it by asking you to provide certain information (e.g., asking for your email address) or as otherwise required by the CCPA. If you would like to use an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests on your behalf. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
Financial Incentives Program
: The CCPA allows us to offer certain financial incentive programs that may result in different prices, rates or quality levels pursuant to your prior opt-in consent and the difference in price, rates or quality levels is directly related to the value that is provided to us by your personal information. We currently provide the following financial incentive program(s): Bar Rewards Loyalty Program and TouchTunes Mobile Rewards Loyalty Program.
The Bar Rewards Loyalty Program allows management and staff at TouchTunes venues to participate in sweepstakes and earn free jukebox credits based on the number of unique check-ins at their TouchTunes venue each week. Jukebox credits may be used to play songs on any mobile-enabled TouchTunes jukebox within the country in which they were earned.  Additional personal information, such as identifiers, including name, phone number, and email address, may be required to participate in such sweepstakes. Management and staff at TouchTunes venues can opt-in to the Bar Rewards Loyalty Program by providing identifiers, including name, phone number, and email address, when they follow the sign-up process at
https://www.touchtunes.com/barrewards
. Management and staff at TouchTunes venues may opt-out or withdraw from the program at any point by emailing us at
mobileconsumersupport@touchtunes.com
.
The TouchTunes Mobile Rewards Loyalty Program allows users to earn bonus jukebox credits based on the number of songs users play each month, and to earn special rewards, such as Play Next tokens and the ability to view the next songs in the queue, based on the total number of songs users play over time. Jukebox credits may be used to play songs on any mobile-enabled TouchTunes jukebox within the country in which they were earned.  Play Next tokens allow users to skip the song queue and play their song choice next. Users can opt-in to the TouchTunes Mobile Rewards Loyalty Program by providing identifiers, including name, phone number, and email address, when they sign up for the program. Users may opt-out or withdraw from the program at any point by contacting support through the app or by emailing us at
mobileconsumersupport@touchtunes.com
