1. Your Right to Privacy
Privacy is essential to the exercise of free speech, free thought, and free association. The New York Public Library (“NYPL” or “Library”) is committed to protecting your privacy, whether you are a patron, visitor, and/or donor. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from you and why.
By using our website, attending our events, participating in our programs, downloading our mobile applications, accessing our databases, visiting a Library location, or donating to us, you agree to this policy.
With your consent, you agree to let us use your email address and/or phone number and postal address to communicate with you about our programs, services, and fundraising efforts. However, in accordance with New York State law (NY CPLR Section 4509) and our own commitment to your privacy,
information about materials that you check out and information that you access is kept confidential
.
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time and
we will notify you by posting such changes on our website
, so we encourage you to check back periodically for updates. We will alert you to material changes that have been made by indicating on the policy the date it was last updated, by placing a notice on our website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
2. What personal information does NYPL collect and store, why and what do we do with it?
We collect information about you in three ways:
Directly from you,
From automatically collected network logs, and
Through cookies.
We typically keep information only for so long as it is needed for the proper operation of the Library and in order to deliver better Library services to you. We may retain some information in backup storage systems, hard copy form, or as required by law. We collect different types of information from you depending on how you choose to engage with our Library services and the information needed in order to provide you with access to those services.
We only collect the minimum we need to deliver the service you are using at the time and we do our best to remove it at the earliest possible opportunity
.
2.a Information that you provide
When you register for an account for our Library services or to get a Library card, we ask you to share certain information with us. If you register with us, we offer you the opportunity to review and, when practical, to update, change, or delete some information you have provided us. You can do this by:
Logging into your cardholder account on our website
Asking our staff to assist you by phone at 1-917-ASK-NYPL
Emailing us at
gethelp@nypl.org
Visiting a Library location and speaking to our staff
If you deactivate your library card account or delete key information—such as your Library card number—you may not be able to continue using certain Library services that require registration.
The information that you provide can include personally identifiable information (PII), where you live, shared content, social media information, login credentials (email address, password, Library card barcode number and pin, or other login mechanisms depending on the system), and your Library account record. For additional details about these information types, please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
.
2.b Information collected and stored automatically
When you use our Library services, such as our website and mobile applications, our computer servers automatically capture and save information electronically about your usage of our Library services. Again, we make sure to only collect the minimum amount of data needed for our services to work. In most cases we do not store this data; while we do sometimes look at the data in aggregate, we do not focus on you as an individual. Examples of information that we may collect include the Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the computer you are using; your general location; type of web browser, operating system, or electronic device; date, time, and length of your visit; the website that you visited immediately before arriving at our own website; pages that you visited on our website; and searches/queries that you conducted or other interaction data. Note that this information is captured in aggregate and not in any individually identifiable way. For additional details about these information types, please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
.
If you are using a Library-provided device, we may also record your Library card’s barcode, time and length of your session, and the websites that you visited. If you are using our public Wi-Fi network, we may, in addition, also collect the MAC address and name of your Wi-Fi device.
Cookies.
A cookie is a small data file sent from your web browser to a web server and is stored on your computer’s, or electronic device’s, hard drive. They are generated by websites to provide users with a personalized and often simplified online experience. You have the option of disabling such cookies if you choose to. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Library services.
Security Cameras:
For more information about footage from security cameras used in NYPL buildings, please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
.
2.c Patron circulation records
When you create an account for a card in our circulating Library, we require that you provide certain personal information—such as a name, address, email, phone number, date of birth. We hold onto this information for only as long as you keep an NYPL account. You can, at any time, close your account, which will then delete this information from our circulation system. Even while you have an active circulating Library account, our systems
only
retain the information about your borrowing records for the time during which those items (books, CDs, etc.) are on loan to you. And, as long as there are no outstanding fines on the borrowed materials, we delete the record of those loans soon after you return the borrowed materials.
Outside of our
circulation system
, there are other places in the Library—such as in our Research Division, NYPL classes and programming, or via third-party vendors, etc.—where information you have provided would be retained or deleted under different guidelines. See, in particular, Section 3 (“Third-party vendors and websites”), Section 4.a (“Personal information used by NYPL”), and Section 4.c (“When You Share Content with the Broader Public”).
3. Third-Party Vendors and Websites
We often use third-party Library service providers and technologies to help deliver some of our services to you, including our cataloguing services, online services such as databases, digital classes and programs, digital collections, streaming media content, communications to you, collaboration, projects, etc. We will make every effort to let you know when a third-party company is being used to deliver our services. If and when you choose to use such services, we may need to share your information with these third parties, but only as necessary for them to provide the services on behalf of NYPL. We may also display links taking you to third-party services or content. By following these links, you may be providing information (including, but not limited to personal information such as your name, username, email address, and password) directly to a third party, to us, or to both.
By using these services, you will be acknowledging and agreeing that NYPL is not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information.
Library patrons must understand when using remote or third-party vendor sites that there are limits to the privacy protection the Library can provide.
We make reasonable efforts to ensure that third parties conform to NYPL’s Privacy Policy and we ensure that they comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We continually monitor and evaluate such vendors to ensure that their policies remain in line with our requirements of them or our formal agreements with them.
We also make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Library's contracts, licenses, and offsite computer service arrangements reflect our policies and legal obligations concerning patron privacy and the confidentiality of patron data.
The Library expects third-party service providers to:
Conform to Library privacy policies.
Provide a service that complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
Refrain from collecting or sharing additional information about patrons, other than what is needed for delivery of the Library services provided.
Have a publicly posted privacy policy.
Where we negotiate contracts to use third-party services, those services must also be in keeping with our privacy values.
There are instances where terms of use are not individually negotiated. In those instances, we educate staff who are making such purchasing decisions so that they are aware of our expectations regarding privacy, and they remain vigilant to ensure the services are in line with our values.
Third-party service providers may collect and share your information, including:
Personally identifiable information you knowingly provide. This includes when you register for access to their site, provide feedback and suggestions, request information, or create shared content.
Other information that you may not knowingly provide, but that could be used to identify you, such as your Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), search history, location-based data, and device information.
Biometric data such as facial recognition, voice recognition. For more information, please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
.
Non-personally identifiable information. This includes advertisements on the pages that you visit, analytics, browser information (type and language), cookie data, date/time of your request, demographic data, hardware/software type, interaction data, serving domains, page views, and the web page you visited immediately prior to visiting the third-party site.
Other data as described in the vendor's privacy policy and terms of use.
For more information on these services and the types of data that are collected and shared, refer to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies on their webpages. You may choose not to use these third-party services if you do not accept their terms of use and privacy policies. Please take the time to read them carefully.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service with whom you interact through our Library services.
You can always choose not to use third-party websites or services if you do not accept their privacy policies.
The Library also suggests links to external websites that are not under contract or our direct control. In these instances, you are not required to give these sites your Library card or any other personally identifiable information in order to use their services.
4. How is my personal information used and who has access to it?
4.a Personal information used by NYPL
Depending on the specific Library services you choose to use, the following are some examples of the ways we use your information in order to provide those services to you.
We use:
Residency verification for Library cards.
Personal information for Library records—such as book borrowing details, help desk and reference queries, fine/fee payments, surveys, and promotional and fundraising campaigns.
Login Credentials, Shared Content and Cookies for delivery of enhanced or personalized services.
When you sign up for a digital library card through your mobile device, we verify that you are in our service area by checking the geo-location of your device. We do not store or keep this data.
For additional examples and details, please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information
page.
4.b Aggregated data
Sometimes the information collected about you through any of our services may be de-identified and aggregated with other information collected about other users, visitors, or donors.
This de-identified and aggregated information cannot be used to reasonably identify you.
The information we compile like this helps us to administer services, analyze usage, provide security, and count the number of new people using our Library services. In addition, it helps us to improve your user experience and allows the Library to promote its work to stakeholders and donors, and advocate for additional support for our services and resources.
4.c Personal information which NYPL shares
When You Share Content with the Broader Public.
If you choose to share content or comments through our programs or online services, the Shared Content may be publicly accessible. If you do not want to share content publicly, you may be able to use your privacy settings to limit sharing (see our
for additional information
), but not always. You may delete some content that you have shared, but some interactive shared content may persist in association with you and/or your registered user account,
even after your account is terminated
. Therefore, you should keep this in mind when participating in shared content activity through our Library services. We will make every attempt to make it clear before you contribute (at the point of submission/participation): a) whether this information will become public, and b) whether you have control over your content once submitted.
Fundraising Outreach.
We do not rent or sell your personal information, but, as is customary in the nonprofit world, we do share names and postal addresses of our donors (only) with some other nonprofit cultural organizations. Sharing this information with other reputable charitable organizations is the most cost-effective way to offer our services to new users, share program offerings, and attract new donors. If you would prefer that your information not be shared with other organizations, (a)
click here to request removal from the exchange
, or (b) contact the Development Office by phone at 212-930-0653 or email
friends@nypl.org
.
Funders and Other Contributors.
We are often only able to provide certain programs and services, which we would not otherwise be able to afford, due to the generous support of donors, funders, and contributors. These funds are occasionally dependent upon NYPL complying with the reporting requirements of the donor, funder, or contributor. If you participate in these optional programs and services, your information may be included in these reports. When appropriate and practical, we will tell you the names of funders and contributors associated with these programs and services, as well as what data and information we may need to share with them, in the registration process.
5. Your Choice and Consent
You can manage most information within your registered user account or you can ask our staff to assist you by phone at 1-917-ASK-NYPL, by emailing us at
gethelp@nypl.org
, or by visiting a Library location and speaking to our staff. Our information storage systems are configured in a way that helps us to protect information from accidental or malicious destruction. To that purpose, the information we collect is also saved, on the same terms we have outlined above, in backup storage systems. Therefore, any update, change, or deletion you make to your information or preferences may not immediately be reflected in all copies of the information we have and may not be removed from our backup storage systems until they are updated and overwritten.
For more information about the choices and control over your personal information, please refer to our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
.
6. Legal Requests
Sometimes the law requires us to share your information, such as if we receive a valid subpoena, warrant, or court order. On such occasions, we will share your information if:
Our careful review leads us to believe that the subpoena, warrant, or court order is valid, and that the law, including state privacy law applicable to Library records, requires us to do so.
OR
The Library is the complainant.
OR
Exigent circumstances exist (for example, a life-and-death emergency or the risk of serious physical injury).
As explained earlier above, we are bound by New York State CPLR Section 4509, which specifically protects library patron data.
If NYPL receives a valid subpoena, warrant, or court order for a patron’s information, it is our policy to notify the patron via email before any information is disclosed,
with certain exceptions such as being required by authorities not to contact the patron, or if we have no way to contact the patron.
7. Children’s Information
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regulates online collection of information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you may not be allowed to use our online services without your parent’s or guardian’s permission, especially when your personal information may be automatically collected. Parents and guardians of children under the age of 13 may view their children’s Library records.
Parents and guardians of children between the ages of 13 and 17 (inclusive) may also view their children’s Library records,
but require their children’s consent to do so
. We may partner with third-party services to provide educational content for children. Parents and guardians should review those services’ privacy policies before permitting their children to use them. Parents and guardians may also need to sign additional consent forms for the collection of information about their children before they can gain access to optional programs and services, such as our enrolled programs.
For more information about internet safety for minors, please see the Library’s
Internet Safety for Children and Teens notice
.
8. Public Computers and Connected Devices
The Library does not keep a record of your activities on any Library-provided computer or laptop. Any records of browsing history and activities are removed when you log out. The next patron cannot see any of your information. Please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information page for more information
.
All personally identifiable information is purged within 24 hours of the end of your public computer reservation.
An anonymous log is created that includes only the computer terminal number, reservation time, and duration of the session. These anonymous reservation statistics remain in the system.
All connected devices you borrow from the Library (e.g. tablets, e-readers) have their history manually cleared by Library staff immediately after you return the device.
9. Data and Network Security
The Library uses software programs that monitor network traffic and computer activity to identify and prohibit unauthorized attempts to compromise Library technology, including preventing malware, viruses, and bad actors from entering the Library’s network, or otherwise disrupt Library operations. No attempts are made by the Library to identify individual patrons or their usage habits and no software is installed on patron-owned devices. Please see Section 2.b (“Information collected and stored automatically”) and our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
for further clarification.

2.c Patron circulation records
When you create an account for a card in our circulating Library, we require that you provide certain personal information—such as a name, address, email, phone number, date of birth. We hold onto this information for only as long as you keep an NYPL account. You can, at any time, close your account, which will then delete this information from our circulation system. Even while you have an active circulating Library account, our systems
only
retain the information about your borrowing records for the time during which those items (books, CDs, etc.) are on loan to you. And, as long as there are no outstanding fines on the borrowed materials, we delete the record of those loans soon after you return the borrowed materials.
Outside of our
circulation system
, there are other places in the Library—such as in our Research Division, NYPL classes and programming, or via third-party vendors, etc.—where information you have provided would be retained or deleted under different guidelines. See, in particular, Section 3 (“Third-party vendors and websites”), Section 4.a (“Personal information used by NYPL”), and Section 4.c (“When You Share Content with the Broader Public”).
3. Third-Party Vendors and Websites
We often use third-party Library service providers and technologies to help deliver some of our services to you, including our cataloguing services, online services such as databases, digital classes and programs, digital collections, streaming media content, communications to you, collaboration, projects, etc. We will make every effort to let you know when a third-party company is being used to deliver our services. If and when you choose to use such services, we may need to share your information with these third parties, but only as necessary for them to provide the services on behalf of NYPL. We may also display links taking you to third-party services or content. By following these links, you may be providing information (including, but not limited to personal information such as your name, username, email address, and password) directly to a third party, to us, or to both.
By using these services, you will be acknowledging and agreeing that NYPL is not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information.
Library patrons must understand when using remote or third-party vendor sites that there are limits to the privacy protection the Library can provide.
We make reasonable efforts to ensure that third parties conform to NYPL’s Privacy Policy and we ensure that they comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We continually monitor and evaluate such vendors to ensure that their policies remain in line with our requirements of them or our formal agreements with them.
We also make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Library's contracts, licenses, and offsite computer service arrangements reflect our policies and legal obligations concerning patron privacy and the confidentiality of patron data.
The Library expects third-party service providers to:
Conform to Library privacy policies.
Provide a service that complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
Refrain from collecting or sharing additional information about patrons, other than what is needed for delivery of the Library services provided.
Have a publicly posted privacy policy.
Where we negotiate contracts to use third-party services, those services must also be in keeping with our privacy values.
There are instances where terms of use are not individually negotiated. In those instances, we educate staff who are making such purchasing decisions so that they are aware of our expectations regarding privacy, and they remain vigilant to ensure the services are in line with our values.
Third-party service providers may collect and share your information, including:
Personally identifiable information you knowingly provide. This includes when you register for access to their site, provide feedback and suggestions, request information, or create shared content.
Other information that you may not knowingly provide, but that could be used to identify you, such as your Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), search history, location-based data, and device information.
Biometric data such as facial recognition, voice recognition. For more information, please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
.
Non-personally identifiable information. This includes advertisements on the pages that you visit, analytics, browser information (type and language), cookie data, date/time of your request, demographic data, hardware/software type, interaction data, serving domains, page views, and the web page you visited immediately prior to visiting the third-party site.
Other data as described in the vendor's privacy policy and terms of use.
For more information on these services and the types of data that are collected and shared, refer to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies on their webpages. You may choose not to use these third-party services if you do not accept their terms of use and privacy policies. Please take the time to read them carefully.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service with whom you interact through our Library services.
You can always choose not to use third-party websites or services if you do not accept their privacy policies.
The Library also suggests links to external websites that are not under contract or our direct control. In these instances, you are not required to give these sites your Library card or any other personally identifiable information in order to use their services.
4. How is my personal information used and who has access to it?
4.a Personal information used by NYPL
Depending on the specific Library services you choose to use, the following are some examples of the ways we use your information in order to provide those services to you.
We use:
Residency verification for Library cards.
Personal information for Library records—such as book borrowing details, help desk and reference queries, fine/fee payments, surveys, and promotional and fundraising campaigns.
Login Credentials, Shared Content and Cookies for delivery of enhanced or personalized services.
When you sign up for a digital library card through your mobile device, we verify that you are in our service area by checking the geo-location of your device. We do not store or keep this data.
For additional examples and details, please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information
page.
4.b Aggregated data
Sometimes the information collected about you through any of our services may be de-identified and aggregated with other information collected about other users, visitors, or donors.
This de-identified and aggregated information cannot be used to reasonably identify you.
The information we compile like this helps us to administer services, analyze usage, provide security, and count the number of new people using our Library services. In addition, it helps us to improve your user experience and allows the Library to promote its work to stakeholders and donors, and advocate for additional support for our services and resources.
4.c Personal information which NYPL shares
When You Share Content with the Broader Public.
If you choose to share content or comments through our programs or online services, the Shared Content may be publicly accessible. If you do not want to share content publicly, you may be able to use your privacy settings to limit sharing (see our
for additional information
), but not always. You may delete some content that you have shared, but some interactive shared content may persist in association with you and/or your registered user account,
even after your account is terminated
. Therefore, you should keep this in mind when participating in shared content activity through our Library services. We will make every attempt to make it clear before you contribute (at the point of submission/participation): a) whether this information will become public, and b) whether you have control over your content once submitted.
Fundraising Outreach.
We do not rent or sell your personal information, but, as is customary in the nonprofit world, we do share names and postal addresses of our donors (only) with some other nonprofit cultural organizations. Sharing this information with other reputable charitable organizations is the most cost-effective way to offer our services to new users, share program offerings, and attract new donors. If you would prefer that your information not be shared with other organizations, (a)
click here to request removal from the exchange
, or (b) contact the Development Office by phone at 212-930-0653 or email
friends@nypl.org
.
Funders and Other Contributors.
We are often only able to provide certain programs and services, which we would not otherwise be able to afford, due to the generous support of donors, funders, and contributors. These funds are occasionally dependent upon NYPL complying with the reporting requirements of the donor, funder, or contributor. If you participate in these optional programs and services, your information may be included in these reports. When appropriate and practical, we will tell you the names of funders and contributors associated with these programs and services, as well as what data and information we may need to share with them, in the registration process.
5. Your Choice and Consent
You can manage most information within your registered user account or you can ask our staff to assist you by phone at 1-917-ASK-NYPL, by emailing us at
gethelp@nypl.org
, or by visiting a Library location and speaking to our staff. Our information storage systems are configured in a way that helps us to protect information from accidental or malicious destruction. To that purpose, the information we collect is also saved, on the same terms we have outlined above, in backup storage systems. Therefore, any update, change, or deletion you make to your information or preferences may not immediately be reflected in all copies of the information we have and may not be removed from our backup storage systems until they are updated and overwritten.
For more information about the choices and control over your personal information, please refer to our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
.
6. Legal Requests
Sometimes the law requires us to share your information, such as if we receive a valid subpoena, warrant, or court order. On such occasions, we will share your information if:
Our careful review leads us to believe that the subpoena, warrant, or court order is valid, and that the law, including state privacy law applicable to Library records, requires us to do so.
OR
The Library is the complainant.
OR
Exigent circumstances exist (for example, a life-and-death emergency or the risk of serious physical injury).
As explained earlier above, we are bound by New York State CPLR Section 4509, which specifically protects library patron data.
If NYPL receives a valid subpoena, warrant, or court order for a patron’s information, it is our policy to notify the patron via email before any information is disclosed,
with certain exceptions such as being required by authorities not to contact the patron, or if we have no way to contact the patron.
7. Children’s Information
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regulates online collection of information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you may not be allowed to use our online services without your parent’s or guardian’s permission, especially when your personal information may be automatically collected. Parents and guardians of children under the age of 13 may view their children’s Library records.
Parents and guardians of children between the ages of 13 and 17 (inclusive) may also view their children’s Library records,
but require their children’s consent to do so
. We may partner with third-party services to provide educational content for children. Parents and guardians should review those services’ privacy policies before permitting their children to use them. Parents and guardians may also need to sign additional consent forms for the collection of information about their children before they can gain access to optional programs and services, such as our enrolled programs.
For more information about internet safety for minors, please see the Library’s
Internet Safety for Children and Teens notice
.
8. Public Computers and Connected Devices
The Library does not keep a record of your activities on any Library-provided computer or laptop. Any records of browsing history and activities are removed when you log out. The next patron cannot see any of your information. Please see our
Further Privacy Details and Information page for more information
.
All personally identifiable information is purged within 24 hours of the end of your public computer reservation.
An anonymous log is created that includes only the computer terminal number, reservation time, and duration of the session. These anonymous reservation statistics remain in the system.
All connected devices you borrow from the Library (e.g. tablets, e-readers) have their history manually cleared by Library staff immediately after you return the device.
9. Data and Network Security
The Library uses software programs that monitor network traffic and computer activity to identify and prohibit unauthorized attempts to compromise Library technology, including preventing malware, viruses, and bad actors from entering the Library’s network, or otherwise disrupt Library operations. No attempts are made by the Library to identify individual patrons or their usage habits and no software is installed on patron-owned devices. Please see Section 2.b (“Information collected and stored automatically”) and our
Further Privacy Details and Information page
for further clarification.

QUESTION: What are the “information types” that patrons might choose to provide to NYPL (as mentioned in Section 2.a of the
NYPL Privacy Policy
)?
When you register for an account for our Library services or to get a Library card, we ask you to share certain information with us. If you register with us, we offer you the opportunity to review and, when practical, to update, change, or delete some information you have provided us. If you deactivate your library card account or delete key information—such as your Library card number—you may not be able to continue using certain Library services that require registration.
Below are some of the information types patrons might choose to provide the Library and what they might encompass.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
Any information that can personally identify you, such as your name, physical address, email address, phone number, Library barcode, payment information, and other similar information.
Residency Verification:
This is proof of information, such as from a driver’s license, other government-issued identification, and utility bills containing a postal address (click
here
for a complete list of acceptable forms of proof of residency), used only to verify address and date of birth. We do not store any other information from your verification document(s).
Shared Content:
This includes anything created by you that you choose to make public by using our Library services. Your registered user account and any information you have chosen to display may accompany your shared content.
Social Media Information:
This includes the option of using your social media accounts and posting content on our social media pages, our crowdsourcing sites, or elsewhere on the Internet, and such information you allow to be shared with us.
Login Credentials:
This includes username, password, and a set of personal questions about you and is provided as part of the process to create an online user account which allows you to view your Library Records at any time by logging into your account.
Library Record:
This contains your Personal Information related to your personal use of circulating and non-circulating Library materials, including, but not limited to, computer database searches, interlibrary-loan transactions, reference queries, emails, faxes, requests for photocopies of Library materials, title reserve requests, and the use of audio-visual materials such as films and music.
QUESTION: What are the “information types” that NYPL might automatically collect about a patron (as mentioned in Section 2.b of the NYPL Privacy Policy)?
When you use our Library services, such as our website and mobile applications, our computer servers automatically capture and save information electronically about your usage of our Library services. Again, we make sure to only collect the minimum amount of data needed for our services to work. In most cases we do not store this data; while we do sometimes look at the data in aggregate, we do not focus on you as an individual. Examples of information that we may collect include the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; your general location; type of web browser, operating system, or electronic device; date, time, and length of your visit; the website that you visited immediately before arriving at our own website; pages that you visited on our website; and searches/queries that you conducted or other interaction data. Note that this information is captured in aggregate and not in any individually-identifiable way.
Below are examples of information types we may automatically collect about a patron.
Your Internet Protocol (IP) Address:
for example, this is briefly used to verify your location when applying for a digital library card, but is not stored beyond the verification process.
Your Location:
for example, this is also used, but not stored, to verify your location when applying for a digital library card, or briefly when using SimplyE or our other mobile apps to verify your eligibility for a library card.
Kind of Web Browser, Operating System, or Electronic Device You Use:
this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital products and services are used.
Date, Time, and Length of Your Visit:
this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital products and services are used.
Website You Visited Immediately Before Arriving at Our Website:
it is not captured in any individually identifiable way—this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital products and services are used.
Pages You Viewed on Our Website:
this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital product and services are used.
Certain Searches/Queries that You Conducted, or Other Interaction Data:
this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital product and services are used.
QUESTION: How is my personal information used and who has access to it? (from Sec. 4.a)
Depending on the specific Library services you choose to use, the following are some examples of the ways we use your information in order to provide those services to you.
Library Records:
Library records are records that contain names or other personally identifiable details regarding library users and include, but are not limited to, circulation records, computer database searches, interlibrary loan transactions, reference queries, requests for photocopies, title reserve requests, or the use of a/v, films, or phonorecords.
Personal Information and Residency Verification to Issue Library Cards:
If a user chooses to provide an email address, NYPL may use it to send account alerts and other communications. We use Library Records to assist in maintaining our collections and to verify records of users’ paid and unpaid fines.
Shared Content, Login Credentials, and Library Records:
Used, as allowed by you and in accordance with the preferences you have established, to deliver enhanced or personalized services.
Personal Information, Login Credentials, and Residency Verification:
Used to provide access to e-books through our mobile applications.

Used to provide opportunities to further engage with the Library through advocacy and fundraising campaigns.
Cookies:
These are small files of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. They can be stored either for a single browser session or more permanently. We use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities, distinguish you from other users, provide functionality, and analyze use of Library services. The types of cookies we may use to collect information are as follows:
Strictly necessary cookies.
Some cookies are strictly necessary to make Library services available to you. We cannot provide you with the Services without this type of cookies.
Functional cookies.
These are used to recognize you when you return to the Library services. This enables us to adapt our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
Analytical or Performance cookies.
We also use cookies for analytics purposes in order to operate, maintain, and improve our services. We may use our own analytics cookies or use third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf. These providers may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google’s browser plug-in located here.
QUESTION (from section 4.a): How does NYPL use my information?
In addition to library card account information, the Library may use additional information for the following purposes to enhance and improve services:
Event registration information, including name and email address
Education programs
We collect PII as part of enrollment-based programs
We use PII for internal/external evaluations
We use photos/videos of program participants on our website (with consent)
We use work product on our web (with consent)

Advocacy campaign information: information including name, address, and email address is collected for advocacy campaigns; patron messages and information may be sent to elected officials during the campaign as described on advocacy web pages
Fundraising: name, address, and donation history (NO credit card history, or other institutions to which people have given) are used in order to suggest donation amounts
Third-party services may use information according to their own privacy policies

QUESTION (from section 4.c): What does “sharing content publicly” mean and how can I control it?
If you choose to share content or comments through our programs or online services, the Shared Content may be publicly accessible. You may be able to delete some content that you have shared, but some interactive shared content may persist in association with you and/or your registered user account, even after your account is terminated. Below are some examples of the types of content that may be shared publicly.
Survey comments that are anonymized or used with permission (e.g., anonymous quotes given in answering surveys)
Blog comments, comments or ‘likes’ on social media, library-campaign comments, and submissions (e.g., digital ‘sticky notes’)
Public reviews (e.g. reviews posted on Google business, App Store, Google Play)
Photos which may be shared after the Library obtains release/permission
QUESTION (from section 5): What choices do I have in managing my Library account information?
You can manage most information within your registered user account or you can ask our staff to assist you by phone at 1-917-ASK-NYPL, by emailing us at
gethelp@nypl.org
, or by visiting a Library location and speaking to our staff. Our information storage systems are configured in a way that helps us to protect information from accidental or malicious destruction. To that purpose, the information we collect is also saved, on the same terms we have outlined above, in backup storage systems. Therefore, any update, change, or deletion you make to your information or preferences may not immediately be reflected in all copies of the information we have and may not be removed from our backup storage systems until they are updated and overwritten.
QUESTION: How do I manage my e-communications from the Library, including e-newsletters, library information, fundraising messages, and more?
There are many ways you can manage the communications you receive electronically from the Library. Some examples are below.
Manage your existing NYPL e-newsletter subscriptions: If you would like to select which e-newsletters you receive from NYPL, click on the "Manage Subscriptions" link at the bottom of the NYPL e-newsletter you received or
click here
.
Unsubscribe from one NYPL e-newsletter or a type of message: If you would like to unsubscribe from a certain e-newsletter or type of email message from NYPL, click "1-Click Unsubscribe" at the bottom of the NYPL email you received. Your removal will be processed instantly.
Unsubscribe from all NYPL emails:
Click here to be removed from all NYPL emails
, including e-newsletters, event invitations, action alerts, and fundraising messages.
You can always contact Ask NYPL for more information or for information about how to navigate your choices.
QUESTION: How do I remove myself from postal mail (snail mail) related to fundraising?
To be removed from fundraising postal mail, please contact
friends@nypl.org
.
Occasionally, Library cardholders may receive postal mail related to your library card/account. To request deletion of your library card account, see question above regarding Section 5 of the Privacy Policy.
QUESTION (from section 2.b): What type of information is captured and stored by NYPL’s security cameras?
Our security cameras are located inside of—and often on the exterior—of most of our facilities. Footage from these cameras is for monitoring Library security only, is kept for a maximum of 30 days, and is shared outside of NYPL only under subpoena or warrant, as specified in the ‘Legal Requests’ section (Section 6) of our Privacy Policy.
QUESTION (from section 3): What kind of biometric data and information is captured by NYPL’s third-party services?
When you use a service that the Library does not own, that service might collect data about you or people near you. That data can include biometric data such a sounds of voices or images of faces captured by your computer or mobile device. For example, if you take part in an online program from home, voices or faces of people in your home could be captured.
The Library does not collect or control data gathered by third-party services. Though we take steps to vet these services, be sure to read the Privacy Policy of any services you use through the Library. Voice and facial data can be used by third parties, along with other data they collect through services the Library does not use.
QUESTION: How does the SimplyE app use my information?
ANSWER: SimplyE is an NYPL-designed application whose creation incorporated best-practice privacy controls including the following:
The "camera" permission is used when you wish to take a picture of your library card number rather than type it in. Many of our patrons already have physical library cards and this feature was added for convenience. The image is not saved as a photo on your device. On newer devices you do have the option to allow the app to use this feature. On older models you can disable this feature after you download the app by going to the app settings.
The "Location" feature is used only to verify that you are in New York State when you first apply for an NYPL library card. When you register for a card, you are asked to enable Location Access. However, your GPS location is not sent to any server. If your device is not within New York State, the SimplyE mobile app simply won’t initiate the signup process. The signup process itself doesn't receive or store location data. If you already have a library card, you can opt to disable Location Access at any time.
The "storage" permission is needed to store downloaded e-books on your device storage.
The "Wi-Fi" permission allows the app to check to see if Wi-Fi is enabled. You can also choose to have the app only use Wi-Fi and not network data to access e-books.
The current release of the SimplyE mobile app asks for permission to use the device microphone, but this is unnecessary, because SimplyE never actually accesses the device microphone. This was caused by a mistake on our part; SimplyE does not need this permission, never accesses the device microphone, and as of the next release will not ask for access to it.
The descriptions of the permissions seen on the Play Store description of the SimplyE mobile app are Google’s general descriptions of what an app with these permissions could do. They don’t represent what the SimplyE mobile app actually does. As an example, an app with the “take pictures and videos” permission can use the device camera whenever the app is open, but SimplyE only uses it in one specific situation: when a patron wants to take a picture of their library card.
The source code underlying the SimplyE mobile app is
available for public inspection
, and we welcome bug reports, especially regarding security and privacy problems.
We do not use or access these features to do anything other than the specific activities described above.
Please feel free to contact NYPL if you have further questions about the SimplyE app or any of NYPL's services.
QUESTION (from section 8): When I use an NYPL public computer or NYPL Wi-Fi, what happens to my data?
When you make a reservation to use a Library desktop computer or Library laptop, your barcode number, date, and time of reservation are recorded for a period of 30 days. After this time, the data is anonymized for statistical reporting and kept indefinitely.
When you connect your device to NYPL Wi-Fi, your device's MAC address and confirmation that you have accepted the terms of services is stored for seven days.
All NYPL web traffic is filtered for compliance with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA). The filtering system logs top level domains visited, category of the site, data/time of the visit, disposition (i.e., whether access to a particular website was allowed, blocked, etc.), and IP address of the requesting system. Content viewed or transferred is not monitored or logged. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is not stored with this data. This non-PII data is retained for a period of 30 days.
QUESTION (from section 10): How can I reach someone at NYPL to ask a privacy question or questions about my personal data held by the Library or by its vendors?
If you have questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy and practices, please send us an e- mail at

QUESTION: What are the “information types” that patrons might choose to provide to NYPL (as mentioned in Section 2.a of the
NYPL Privacy Policy
)?
When you register for an account for our Library services or to get a Library card, we ask you to share certain information with us. If you register with us, we offer you the opportunity to review and, when practical, to update, change, or delete some information you have provided us. If you deactivate your library card account or delete key information—such as your Library card number—you may not be able to continue using certain Library services that require registration.
Below are some of the information types patrons might choose to provide the Library and what they might encompass.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
Any information that can personally identify you, such as your name, physical address, email address, phone number, Library barcode, payment information, and other similar information.
Residency Verification:
This is proof of information, such as from a driver’s license, other government-issued identification, and utility bills containing a postal address (click
here
for a complete list of acceptable forms of proof of residency), used only to verify address and date of birth. We do not store any other information from your verification document(s).
Shared Content:
This includes anything created by you that you choose to make public by using our Library services. Your registered user account and any information you have chosen to display may accompany your shared content.
Social Media Information:
This includes the option of using your social media accounts and posting content on our social media pages, our crowdsourcing sites, or elsewhere on the Internet, and such information you allow to be shared with us.
Login Credentials:
This includes username, password, and a set of personal questions about you and is provided as part of the process to create an online user account which allows you to view your Library Records at any time by logging into your account.
Library Record:
This contains your Personal Information related to your personal use of circulating and non-circulating Library materials, including, but not limited to, computer database searches, interlibrary-loan transactions, reference queries, emails, faxes, requests for photocopies of Library materials, title reserve requests, and the use of audio-visual materials such as films and music.
QUESTION: What are the “information types” that NYPL might automatically collect about a patron (as mentioned in Section 2.b of the NYPL Privacy Policy)?
When you use our Library services, such as our website and mobile applications, our computer servers automatically capture and save information electronically about your usage of our Library services. Again, we make sure to only collect the minimum amount of data needed for our services to work. In most cases we do not store this data; while we do sometimes look at the data in aggregate, we do not focus on you as an individual. Examples of information that we may collect include the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; your general location; type of web browser, operating system, or electronic device; date, time, and length of your visit; the website that you visited immediately before arriving at our own website; pages that you visited on our website; and searches/queries that you conducted or other interaction data. Note that this information is captured in aggregate and not in any individually-identifiable way.
Below are examples of information types we may automatically collect about a patron.
Your Internet Protocol (IP) Address:
for example, this is briefly used to verify your location when applying for a digital library card, but is not stored beyond the verification process.
Your Location:
for example, this is also used, but not stored, to verify your location when applying for a digital library card, or briefly when using SimplyE or our other mobile apps to verify your eligibility for a library card.
Kind of Web Browser, Operating System, or Electronic Device You Use:
this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital products and services are used.
Date, Time, and Length of Your Visit:
this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital products and services are used.
Website You Visited Immediately Before Arriving at Our Website:
it is not captured in any individually identifiable way—this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital products and services are used.
Pages You Viewed on Our Website:
this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital product and services are used.
Certain Searches/Queries that You Conducted, or Other Interaction Data:
this data is used in aggregate and is not specific to you, but is used for us to gather overall metrics about how our digital product and services are used.
QUESTION: How is my personal information used and who has access to it? (from Sec. 4.a)
Depending on the specific Library services you choose to use, the following are some examples of the ways we use your information in order to provide those services to you.
Library Records:
Library records are records that contain names or other personally identifiable details regarding library users and include, but are not limited to, circulation records, computer database searches, interlibrary loan transactions, reference queries, requests for photocopies, title reserve requests, or the use of a/v, films, or phonorecords.
Personal Information and Residency Verification to Issue Library Cards:
If a user chooses to provide an email address, NYPL may use it to send account alerts and other communications. We use Library Records to assist in maintaining our collections and to verify records of users’ paid and unpaid fines.

Used, as allowed by you and in accordance with the preferences you have established, to deliver enhanced or personalized services.

We use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities, distinguish you from other users, provide functionality, and analyze use of Library services. The types of cookies we may use to collect information are as follows:
Strictly necessary cookies.
Some cookies are strictly necessary to make Library services available to you. We cannot provide you with the Services without this type of cookies.
Functional cookies.
These are used to recognize you when you return to the Library services. This enables us to adapt our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
Analytical or Performance cookies.
We also use cookies for analytics purposes in order to operate, maintain, and improve our services. We may use our own analytics cookies or use third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf. These providers may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google’s browser plug-in located here.
