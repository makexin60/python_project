Thank you for trusting Quantum App Update Manager. Your privacy is our priority.
Which personal information is collected, and where do we use it for ?
Firebase (Analytics, Ads, Cloud Messaging and Crashlytics):
Firebase is used to show ads, to deliver push notifications and to store crash reports (the latter since App version 2.7.0).
Firebase Cloud Messaging stores an unique token of your device (Instance ID) in order to send push notifications. This token is kept during the lifetime of the application and will (currently) not get removed.
Firebase Ads uses your per-device ad token to show relevant ads.
Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics collect various details about you and your device, such as a unique token (Instance ID), your device model, Operating System version, phone carrier, country, app version and Android version. The Instance ID is linked to your Google Profile and may be used by Google to estimate your Gender, Age and Interests. See the Firebase privacy policies for more information: Google Ads, Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics.
