Privacy Rights
You have certain rights in connection with your information and the manner in which we handle it. Some of these rights may be subject to some exceptions or limitations. The following is a non-closed list of privacy rights you may exercise:
Right to Access Your Information. At any time, you may contact Moonee at the address provided in the "Contact Us" section herein, and request to access the information that Moonee holds about you.
Correcting Your Information. Moonee may need to ask you to provide certain information to make sure you are who you claim to be. If you find the information on your account is not accurate, complete or updated, please provide Moonee with the necessary information in order to correct it.
Withdrawing Your Consent. You are entitled to contact us if you would like to withdraw your consent to the processing of your information. Exercising this right will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.
Deleting or Restricting Access to Your Information. You may request to delete or restrict access to your information. We may postpone or deny your request if your information is in current use for providing Services or for other legitimate purposes, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. If you have any concerns about the way we process your information, you are welcome to write to us at the address set forth in the "Contact Us" section. We will look into your request and make good faith efforts to resolve any concern you may have.
Data Retention
We retain your information for as reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable law. Generally, for as long as needed to provide you with our Services and for an additional period of 7 years from the end of the Services in case we need to resolve any dispute before the competent courts and authorities, unless we are required by law to delete it or if we accept your request to delete the information. The data collected by cookies or related-tracking technology are kept for a maximum of [13] months.
Security
Moonee takes reasonable measures to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure or any form of unlawful use. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Services in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Third Party Sites and Services
Our Services may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit. Any link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those individuals or companies. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, services or products. The scope of this Policy is limited to information and data collected or received by us through your use of the Services.
Children's Privacy
Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Children without the consent of their parent or guardian. If you are a parent or a guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. This is also relevant if the age of legal majority where you reside has an older age of majority. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from Children without verification of parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to remove or cease any use of that information.

We may update this Policy at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Policy periodically for any changes, notably pursuant to legal and/or regulatory provisions. Changes to this Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
