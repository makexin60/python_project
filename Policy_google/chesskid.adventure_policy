Privacy Policy
This document describes how we handle your personal information when you use ChessKid.com including our website, mobile and web apps, features, and other services (collectively, the "Services"). By using our Services, you're saying that you have read, understood, and agree to this privacy policy (the "Policy").
We have crafted this Policy with clarity and simplicity in mind, ensuring it is straightforward and easy to understand for everyone.
The Services are brought to you by Chess.com, LLC, the parent company of ChessKid.
We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing you with the best possible experience.
Information We Collect and How We Use It
1. 1.
At ChessKid, we collect minimal personal information from you. This may include information you voluntarily provide, information required for registration, or information collected by us or our service providers.As applicable, we have listed below the legal basis on which we rely to process your personal information.
1. 2.
If you use our Services without registering, we only collect the minimum necessary information to provide the Services (in our legitimate interests to run a successful business), such as your:
IP address
country
timezone
language
page interactions
referrer information, such as the webpage you were on before you landed on our Service
timestamps
information about operating system, device, and browser you are using.
1. 3.
If you create an account, the personal information we collect will depend on if you are a kid or an adult.
1. 4.
In the case of kid accounts, there are three types of accounts, a basic free account, a Gold account, and a student account.
In the case of a basic kid account, we only require you to choose one of the auto-generated usernames and provide us with your parent or legal guardian's email address so we can ask for their permission and keep them informed about your activity (in our legitimate interests to run a safe and kid-friendly Service).
1. 5.
Note that usernames do not use any personal information in the auto-generation process itself and we will not require a kid to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to use the Services or participate in an online activity.
1. 6.
Gold accounts. Gold members have access to additional features such as the ability to customize their username, add their name and last name to their profile, and use the classroom feature. For that reason, if you are a gold member, apart from the basic information, we may also process other information you provide to us which will depend on the gold feature you use. For example, if you use the classroom feature we will process your image and voice provided you enable your deviceÂ´s camera and microphone (we do not keep a record of the classroom session and the camera and microphone are disabled by default). We will process such information in our legitimate interests to run a successful and innovative business.
Other information we may process from gold members is any personal information you choose to include in the customized username (optional), first and last name (optional), school name in case of a student account, email address (optional), and payment and shipping information, when applicable (in our legitimate interest to provide you with information and materials you request from us, and to run our business effectively).
We strongly advise gold members never to provide any personal information in their usernames.
1. 7.
Student Accounts. In some countries, the law permits educational institutions to provide consent on behalf of students' parents, enabling us to lawfully process the necessary information to deliver our Services. For these student accounts, once we have obtained the required consent, we collect the same personal information as we do from our gold members. We also gather any additional personal information provided by the student's teacher or educational institution.
1. 8.
Adult accounts. If you create an adult account, apart from the information listed in point 1.2 we only require you to choose one of the auto-generated usernames and your email address. You will be able to request a custom username which will need to be reviewed and approved by our staff. This information is essential to provide you with the Services. You will also have the ability to associate your account with a kid's or student's account so that you can see their progress at chess, such as the number of games played. If you are an adult and we process personal information about you as described here, we rely on our contractual necessity to provide you with the Services and our legitimate interest to provide you with information and materials you request from us.
1. 9.
After registering, adults will be able to add their name and last name and any other information they would voluntarily want to add to their profile. This information can be edited at any time. We process this information in our legitimate interest to provide the Services to you and to run our business effectively.
1. 10.

We only use Cookies to provide you with the Services and to enhance your experience on ChessKid.

For example, Cookies are used to remember your preferences and login name. We do not use personal information for advertising purposes.

Should you wish to discontinue using SSO at any time, you have the ability to unlink your SSO account from our service through your account settings. This action does not affect the other information associated with your account with us.

We share such information in our legitimate interests to run a successful business.

Communications With Other Users
4. 1.
Some of the games and activities on our Services let users talk to each other. To keep kids safe and stop them from sharing personal information, messages are very limited. Kids can only start chats with their parents or legal guardians. When playing chess with other users, children can only send pre-selected messages and emojis like "Good luck", "Good game", etc. Kids cannot write their own messages.
4. 2.
Live Classroom. Users are not required to activate their cameras or microphones to participate in a classroom session. However, if you opt to enable these features, please be aware that your image, voice, and physical environment may be incidentally captured and seen by other participants during the classroom session. Any other information voluntarily provided by the user during the session will also be shared. We do not retain any of this information post-session.
Retention of Data
5. 1.
We will keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the reasons explained in this Policy. We will hold onto your information if it's necessary to meet legal requirements (like if laws say we have to keep your data), solve any disputes, and uphold our agreements and policies. We will also keep your information until you tell us not to, in a way that respects your rights and our legal duties.
5. 2.
We might also keep personal information that has been anonymized for our internal analysis. Generally, we keep usage data for a short time, unless we need it to boost security or enhance our Service's functionality, or if the law requires us to keep this data for longer.
Special Note to Parents & School Representatives
6. 1.
At ChessKid, we prioritize the privacy and safety of our young users. We collect the minimal amount of information necessary from children to ensure a functional, engaging, and secure experience on our platforms. To further protect children, our services include features that limit their ability to communicate directly with others. We have designed these measures to prevent the unnecessary disclosure of personal information and to maintain a safe online environment. We are committed to upholding these principles, providing both an educational and safe online experience.
6. 2.
In our commitment to safeguarding the privacy of children and complying with applicable regulations, we make reasonable efforts, in accordance with available technology, to obtain informed consent from parents or legal guardians before processing personal information from Kid accounts.
6. 3.
In some jurisdictions, educational institutions are authorized to consent to the collection of student's information on behalf of the students' parents or legal guardians. This capability allows schools to act as the parent's agent, strictly within the limits established by applicable law. The authority granted to schools is, in general, confined to scenarios that directly pertain to educational functions.
6. 4.
The Internet offers a world of opportunity for children. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. Your efforts to instill responsible information practices will help steer your children to age-appropriate sites and will go a long way toward ensuring that your children have enriching experiences online.

Terms of Service
Put simply: respect others, respect the law, and enjoy yourself!
Welcome to the Terms of Service ("Terms" or "Terms of Service") for ChessKid ("ChessKid," "we," or "us"). At ChessKid, we provide a variety of chess-related content and tools (the "Service").
For purposes of these Terms, "you" and "your" means you as the user of the Services. If you are under the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction or state of residence, before using the services, your parent or legal guardian must read and consent to the ChessKid terms and agree to be responsible for your activities on the Services.
When you use ChessKid you are agreeing to our rules. These Terms are for all ChessKid platforms, whether it's our website, apps, or anything else we create later on. Sometimes, we offer different services that have their own rules. If you use those, make sure to check out their specific terms too as they will apply in addition to these Terms.
This document contains legal terms that may be complex; however, we have made every effort to craft it with clarity and simplicity in mind, ensuring it is straightforward and easy to understand for everyone.
Services
The ChessKid Service is provided as-is, which means ChessKid doesn't promise it will be perfect. ChessKid reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof), by providing you with at least 30 days' notice, for example by email or by other means of notification. In limited instances, we may also discontinue the Service without providing notice, as explained in the 'Termination' section below. If at any time you no longer want to use our Service, you are able to delete your account. You agree that ChessKid shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.
We will work carefully to provide the Service and keep it safe, secure, and free from errors. If we have worked with care, we won't be responsible for losses that aren't caused directly by our breaking these Terms or by our actions; losses that you and we couldn't have expected when we agreed to these Terms; and events beyond our control, like issues with the data or content you encounter using our video play or Classroom service, or how other people behave (online or offline).
Type of Accounts
Our Service offers two main categories of accounts: kid accounts and adult accounts. Kid accounts are further divided into three types: the free basic account; the Gold account, which requires a paid membership and provides access to premium features; and the student account, designed for use within an educational context by students at an educational institution.
Adult accounts come in three variations: Parent accounts for parents or guardians of children using the Service; Coach accounts for adults who wish to teach chess professionally; and Teacher accounts for individuals employed by schools or similar educational institutions to teach chess. The features available vary according to the type of account.
Member Accounts
At ChessKid, you can access lots of our chess-related services without needing to register. However, if you decide to register to get more access or privileges and you will need to create a username and choose a password. Remember, it's your job to keep your password and account private. You are the one responsible for any activity that happens using your account.
If someone uses your account without your permission, or if you think your account security has been breached, you need to tell us right away. Keep in mind, if your account security is compromised because you didn't keep it safe, ChessKid won't be able to help with any loss or damage that happens because of it.
You acknowledge, consent and agree that ChessKid may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms of Service; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of ChessKid, its users and the public.
Live Video Chess Play and Classroom Service
Users may have the option to participate in live video chess play in the classroom with Teachers, coaches, and/or other student users by using the Classroom feature. We do not monitor these live sessions. If you choose to use this video play and/or Classroom service, then you are responsible for the activities of all users who access the Service through your account and you agree to ensure that any such user will comply with the terms of this Agreement and all of our policies. If you become aware of any violation of this Terms of Service in connection with the use of the video play and/or Classroom service by any person, please contact
Support
. We may investigate any complaints and violations that come to our attention and may take any (or no) action that we believe is appropriate, including, but not limited to issuing warnings, removing the content, prohibiting use of the video play and/or Classroom service by an end user, or terminating an account. We also may provide user information to law enforcement and government agencies in response to valid legal requests consistent with our Privacy Policy.
If you are participating in a live streaming event (e.g. Twitch), you are not allowed to watch the live stream during your game or active gameplay session.
Ratings
On ChessKid.com, we use our own rating system consisting of a number that estimates your strength as a chess player in multiple playing methods, such as fast chess and slow chess (rapid and classical), and as a puzzle solver. This means your account will have multiple chess ratings and puzzle ratings.
Ratings on the site are independent of any official rating system. Your rating will go up and down as you win or lose games. This is the only way to calculate your rating. If you leave a fast game after our system starts the timer, regardless of making a move, your rating may go down. The amount your rating changes each time you win or lose a game depends on what your current rating is, what your opponent's rating is, and how many games each of you has completed.
It is forbidden to try to manipulate the rating of your account in an unfair way. We can detect when a user tries to manipulate their own rating in ways that go against the chess spirit and fair play.
Account Limitations
You acknowledge that ChessKid may establish rules and limits on how you can use our Service. This includes things like how long your messages or posts stay on our Service, and what features are available. You agree that ChessKid is not responsible if messages or any other content are deleted or not saved. Also, if you don't use your account for a long time, ChessKid might deactivate it. We may change these rules and limits occasionally and will notify you at least 30 days in advance, for example by email.
Termination
You agree that ChessKid suspend, disable, or delete your account and stop your access to our Service without prior notice under certain circumstances. These include (a) if, in our reasonable opinion, you have breached or violated the Terms of Service or other agreements or guidelines, (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (c) a request by you for self-initiated account deletions, (d) significant changes or discontinuation of the Service, (e) unexpected technical or security issues, (f) your involvement in fraudulent or illegal activities, and (g) failure to pay any fees owed by you in connection with the Services.
When your account is terminated in the situations detailed above, it means that (a) you will lose access to all parts of the Service, (b) your password and all related information, files, and content in your account will be deleted, and (c) you will be barred from further use of the Service. You also agree that all decisions to terminate for these reasons are up to ChessKid, and ChessKid will not be liable to you or any third party for the termination of your account or your access to the Service.

Fair Play
ChessKid takes Fair Play seriously & the rules are the same as on our parent site Chess.com. Parents and guardians, please talk to your child(ren) about sportsmanship and fair play! Dishonest play ruins the experience for others. We want to keep the play experience fun and honest for everyone; we truly care about our users, and the integrity of chess.
ChessKid takes Fair Play abuse seriously. "Fair Play Abuse" at ChessKid means using unfair advantages to win or lose games intentionally. Our policies are clear, strict, and faithfully enforced.
We are effective in identifying and dealing with Fair Play abusers. We promptly close accounts found violating the Fair Play Policy. We will, and have closed accounts during live events as our Fair Play team monitors games in real-time. We take Fair Play very seriously and we will take actions up to and including a permanent ban from ChessKid and Chess.com.
The Fair Play Rules
No chess programs or engines
can be used to analyze positions in ongoing games at any time.
In Slow Chess (turn-based games with several days per move), you may consult any resource which is not engine-based. This includes books, opening databases (including the ChessKid Explorer) for ChessKid/openings, opening moves, and thematic games (though not their engine analyses).
Tablebases are NOT allowed. You may not consult an engine, or another human, to provide an opinion on the opening database, tablebases, self-preparation or analysis
that would relate to a particular game-in-progress on ChessKid.
In Fast Chess,
no outside assistance of any kind is permitted.
Fixing game results by
arranging games, playing with multiple accounts or losing intentionally is also against the rules.
Do not let anyone else play on your account.
If you are participating in a live streaming event (e.g. Twitch),
you are not allowed to watch the live stream during your game
or active gameplay session.
Reporting Unfair Play
If you have reason to believe someone is violating the Fair Play policies in any way like using the illegal assistance of an engine or any other conduct against the rules, please report it to support
here
. Our Fair Play Staff will
conduct a thorough
investigation, keeping all findings confidential,
taking appropriate action against the reported user if/when a concrete assessment has been made.
Please do not discuss your suspicions in the forums!
Any of the above described public accusations or public actions against a member
may lead to your own account being restricted
, regardless of what is found against the accused.
Detecting Unfair Play
Part of our analysis involves comparing human moves to computer moves and looking at the statistical significance of said moves.
To remain effective, other aspects of our detection methods are confidential.
Catching Fair Play Abusers
We work hard to keep ChessKid a safe and positive community for chess players around the world, and are sad whenever any account is closed.
That said, the process of investigating the fair play of our members is a never ending one!
We have a team dedicated to the research, prevention, and ultimately, the closure of accounts found to have accessed illegal assistance during their chess games. Our team is constantly going through the games of our top players, submitting those games into our 'Fair Play Detection System', and evaluating clean play vs non-clean play.
ChessKid continues to close accounts on a daily basis for Fair Play violations.
Players found to have violated the rules of Fair Play
Their accounts may be closed or suspended. Account closures may be permanent.
If we happen to find violations of Fair Play in real-time, we may abort the game in progress, award their opponent with a win and close their account immediately; all games in progress can be awarded to their opponents.
In many 'first time abuser' cases, we offer a chance for admission and apology. If this is given, we will at our sole discretion allow the opening of a new account or give a second chance to reopen the same account. See more details below regarding appeals.
Their rating will be reset to the original rating they had when the account was opened.
Accounts not closed after reporting abuse
We appreciate you reporting your suspicions, but ultimately ChessKid will decide if an account will be closed for abuse or not.
Can someone appeal if their account is closed or suspended?
We are happy to listen to your appeal! Reply to your closure notice and support will work with you to file an appeal.
ChessKid maintains the right to close the accounts of anyone we deem to have broken site rules or applicable laws, acted unfairly to other members or behaved in a way that hurt the site experience for other members.
