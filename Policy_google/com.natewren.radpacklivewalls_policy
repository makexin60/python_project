We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.

Receiving help through our customer support channels;

How do we use and share your personal information?
More information about our data collection and sharing practices can be found in this privacy notice.
You may contact us by visiting natewren.com/contact, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.

We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.
Verification process
Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system.

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
Other privacy rights
you may object to the processing of your personal data.
you may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the data.
you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.

LAWFUL BASIS
Legitimate
Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable
        us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and
        balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal
        data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are
        overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
        You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on
        you in respect of specific activities by

YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
You have the right to:
Request access
o your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables
        you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete
        or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
        provide to us.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data
        where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
        You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised
        your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where
        we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, the further retention of the
        personal data should be lawful where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
        information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public
        interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in
        the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
        purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
        third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing
        on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
        where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that
        we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
        processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s
        accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to
        hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
        (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
        grounds to use it.
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a
        third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
        that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or
        where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However,
        this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
        withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if
        this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
