Privacy Policy
Welcome to FriendsApp Listing's Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it!
Last updated: (10/17/2024) FriendsApp Listing ("us", "we", or "our") operates the FriendsApp Listing mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.
We use your Personal Information only to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
Information Collection and Use
We collect several types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.
Email address
First and last name
Address, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City
Cookies and Usage Data
Mobile device data (e.g., device ID, IP address, operating system, browser type, etc.)
Third-Party Services
We use third-party services such as Google AdMob to serve ads in our app. These services may collect information used to identify you, including:
Advertising ID

Device identifiers
Consent Management for European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland
In compliance with privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we use a certified Consent Management Platform (CMP) registered with the IAB's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) to collect user consent for displaying personalized ads to users in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, and Switzerland.
When you access our Service from these regions, you will be presented with a consent form provided by our CMP. This form will allow you to control and customize your preferences regarding the collection and processing of your personal data for advertising and other purposes.
If you do not provide consent or opt-out of personalized ads, you will continue to see non-personalized ads, which are based solely on contextual data, such as the content of the app you are using.
Missing Transparency and Consent String (TC String)
We take measures to ensure all ad requests from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland contain a valid Transparency and Consent String (TC String) as required by AdMob and other advertising partners. This TC String represents user consent status and ensures that ads are served in accordance with their preferences.
In case a valid TC String is missing, our app will attempt to prompt users to review and manage their consent settings through our CMP. Please ensure you adjust your preferences when prompted, as failure to provide consent may limit ad-serving capabilities.
