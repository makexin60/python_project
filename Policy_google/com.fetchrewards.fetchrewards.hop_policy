The information we collect varies depending on the type of activity you are

  personalize and improve your experience and allows us to provide you with
  opportunities to learn about products and services that may interest you. For
  example:
For Digital Receipt Program ("eReceipts") participants:

  consumer account or email log-in credentials and any personal information
  contained on digital receipts.
We use the information you provide us in connection with our Digital Receipt
  Program (Titled "eReceipts" in the Services) to provide you points relating to
  receipts you receive electronically. The Digital Receipt Program allows you to
  link other email accounts or digital consumer accounts to your Fetch account,
  as directed by you, through the use of your login credentials to that
  account(s) so that Fetch, as your agent, can retrieve purchase information
  from digital receipts in your digital consumer account or email.
We will only collect and/or disclose receipt and other related information
    in your email if you consent by signing up for this program.
You may revoke your consent to the Digital Receipt Program by disabling your
  participation through the App.
In processing your Digital Receipts, Fetch may retrieve Personal Information
  such as billing address, mailing address, name, payment method, and other

  account.

        Website such as letting you know ways to earn points or bonus points.
For Yahoo Users

Yahoo Developer API Terms of Use
and
related policies
, to ensure that information collected through your participation in
        our eReceipts program from your Yahoo account is only used to provide
        you points for your purchases on behalf of our participating brands and
        to improve user-facing features on the App or Website such as letting
        you know ways to earn points or bonus points.

    APIs will adhere to the
API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
Friend information when you Refer a Friend or participate in Social:
When you refer a friend to join Fetch we provide you a link, some
  pre-formatted text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend.
  You send your friend the link, along with the pre-formatted text, and referral
  code on your own, and you do not share any of your friend's information with
  Fetch.
Refer a Friend: If your friends sign up using the "refer a friend" referral
    code that you as your friends' advocate provided, we will let them know that
    their advocate has received points for the referral, and we will let you
    know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their
    first receipt.
Social: If your friends sign up using a referral code inviting them to be
    your Fetch friend, after that friend enters your referral code, they will be
    added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list
    of Fetch friends in Fetch Social.
If you invite someone to be a friend who is already a Fetch member, we
        will provide your friend a push notification, which will take them to
        the Fetch App where they can accept your invitation. If they accept, we
        will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you
        will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends.
We collect and display in each Fetch Social feed and leaderboard, the
        user names and profile photos of the friends with whom you directly
        connect, along with certain Fetch activity information.
We collect information about the people, pages, account activity, and
        groups you are connected to and how you interact with them on our App.
For GoodRx Participants:
We distribute GoodRx Cards through our App on
  behalf of GoodRx, Inc. that contain certain GoodRx information, including BIN,
  PCN, Group, and Member ID. You choose whether to activate your GoodRx Card by
  making a GoodRx Claim. When you activate your Good Rx Card, we provide your
  GoodRx Card information, name, and email address to GoodRx to enable you to
  engage with GoodRx and facilitate your relationship with GoodRx. The
GoodRx Privacy Policy
governs your relationship with GoodRx. When you activate your GoodRx Card and
  make GoodRx Claims, you direct GoodRx to provide Fetch your GoodRx Card Member
  ID and information relating to your transactions, including the pharmacy name
  and zip code and amount of savings associated with your GoodRx Claims, so that
  Fetch can provide you points.

  which we collect or use that information. We will delete or de-identify
  information when it is no longer needed to fulfill the purposes listed for
  each category above, unless a longer retention period is required to comply
  with applicable laws. There may be technical or other operational reasons
  where we are unable to fully delete or de-identify your information. Where
  this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to prevent further
  processing your information.

  receive in participating in our Program is calculated by and depends on the
  amount and nature of your interaction with our participating brands to obtain
  points.

With third parties to facilitate their provision of services to you:
When you engage third party services like GoodRx through our App, we share
  your information with those third parties in order to facilitate your
  relationship with them.
With your friends or other Fetch members participating in Social:
If
  you entered a referral code, we will notify the person to whom Fetch issued
  the referral code that you entered it and both of you will be added to each
  others' friends list. Friends who are directly connected will share between
  them their user names, profile photo, state, number of friends and mutual
  friends, total dollars spent on a receipt, points earned, top brands for which
  points were earned, the store/merchant from which a receipt was scanned, the
  chosen Rewards for which points were redeemed, point-earning activities
  engaged in, the date on which each activity occurred, information about Social
  Offers in which you and your friends are participating, and other information,
  as disclosed to you from time to time. In addition, friends of your friends
  with whom you are not directly connected (i.e. Friends of Friends) and users
  with whom you are not directly or indirectly connected, will be able to see
  your name, profile picture, state, number of friends and mutual friends,
  limited information about Points-earning activities you've engaged in, and
  Fetch points. Fetch members can also search for friends with whom they can
  connect on Social by providing a friend's email address or telephone number.
  If your email address or phone number matches a Fetch member's search, we will
  share your name and profile photo so that member can invite you to be a friend
  and/or join a Social group.
To stop sharing information with your friends in Fetch Social, you can
  disconnect yourself from specific friends or all friends with whom you are
  directly connected. This will delete all information relating to you in your
  Friend's feed and leaderboard.
With other users as part of the referral program:
By providing your
  referral code or referral link to another user, or by entering a referral code
  or referral link from another user, you agree that this will form a digital
  relationship between your accounts, and that your name or other personal
  information may be shared with that user, either in-app or by our customer
  support team.

We will obtain your consent or opt-in to collect or process Sensitive Personal
  Information where we are required to do so by applicable law.
Your Right to Know
Certain states provide the right to request our disclosure of any of the
  following:
the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing with
    third parties for cross context behavioral advertising (e.g., targeted
    advertising);
the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
You can do this through a verified consumer request.
That process is described below in the section, "How to Exercise Your
    Rights."
Your Right to Request Correction of Inaccurate Personal Information
Certain states provide you the right to request correction of inaccurate
  personal information maintained by us. We may request documentation from you
  to determine the accuracy of the information. If you provide us documentation
  either upon our request or through your own initiative, that documentation
  will only be used for the purpose of correcting your personal information and
  complying with our recordkeeping requirements.
As an alternative to correction, we may delete the inaccurate information if
  it does not negatively impact you or if you consent to this deletion. We
  reserve the right to deny this request if allowed under applicable law, or if
  we determine that the contested information is more likely than not accurate,
  based on the totality of circumstances. You can submit a correction request
  through a verified consumer request. That process is described below in the
  section, " How to Exercise Your Rights."
Your Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
Certain states provide the right to request that we delete any of your
  personal information, subject to certain exceptions. You can do this through a
  verified consumer request. That process is described below in the section,
  "How to Exercise Your Rights."
There may be scenarios where we deny your deletion request. If that occurs, we
  will provide you with an explanation as to why we could not delete all or some
  of your personal information.
How to Exercise Your Rights
You may exercise your rights, as applicable, by submitting a verified consumer
  request to know information (and to receive your personal information in a
  portable format), to correct information, or for deletion.
The response to a request to know will provide the personal information we
  have collected and maintained about you, in a portable format, unless an
  exception under applicable state law applies. Please note that, depending on
  the applicable state law, we may not be required to provide personal
  information to you if you make multiple requests in a certain time period. We
  cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we
  cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request. We will only use
  personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
  requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
A form is available at this
link
to request your personal information or request to delete or correct your
  personal information. You can also place a request by email us at
privacy@fetch.com
. If you email your
  request, we ask that you provide the same information requested on the webform
  in order for us to authenticate your request. Your request either through the
  webform or via email will be verified using information you provide as
  described on the webform.
If you submit a request that is not through one of the above designated
  methods or is deficient in some manner unrelated to verification, we will
  provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any
  deficiencies with your request.
Once we receive your verifiable consumer request, we will confirm receipt of
  the request within 10 business days, or as allowed under applicable law,
  describing our verification process. We will respond to your request within 45
  calendar days, or as allowed under applicable law, if we are able to verify
  your identity. Requests for deletion will require a separate confirmation that
  you want your information deleted.
If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written response to that
  account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written
  response by mail or electronically, at your option. Making a verifiable
  consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However,
  we do consider requests made through your password protected account
  sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information
  associated with that specific account.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
  request, if applicable. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
  will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate
  before completing your request.

The information we collect varies depending on the type of activity you are
  performing and helps us provide you the products and services you request,
  personalize and improve your experience and allows us to provide you with
  opportunities to learn about products and services that may interest you. For
  example:
For Digital Receipt Program ("eReceipts") participants:
We may collect
  consumer account or email log-in credentials and any personal information
  contained on digital receipts.
We use the information you provide us in connection with our Digital Receipt
  Program (Titled "eReceipts" in the Services) to provide you points relating to
  receipts you receive electronically. The Digital Receipt Program allows you to
  link other email accounts or digital consumer accounts to your Fetch account,
  as directed by you, through the use of your login credentials to that
  account(s) so that Fetch, as your agent, can retrieve purchase information
  from digital receipts in your digital consumer account or email.
We will only collect and/or disclose receipt and other related information
    in your email if you consent by signing up for this program.
You may revoke your consent to the Digital Receipt Program by disabling your
  participation through the App.
In processing your Digital Receipts, Fetch may retrieve Personal Information
  such as billing address, mailing address, name, payment method, and other
  information contained in the Digital Receipt email. Fetch may scan for any
  data believed to be a receipt in those email accounts or the linked consumer
  account.
For Gmail Users
We comply with the
API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements, and use information collected
        through your participation in our eReceipts program from your Gmail
        account only to provide you points for your purchases on behalf of our
        participating brands and to improve user-facing features on the App or
        Website such as letting you know ways to earn points or bonus points.
For Yahoo Users
We comply with the
Yahoo Developer API Terms of Use
and
related policies
, to ensure that information collected through your participation in
        our eReceipts program from your Yahoo account is only used to provide
        you points for your purchases on behalf of our participating brands and
        to improve user-facing features on the App or Website such as letting
        you know ways to earn points or bonus points.
Our use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google
    APIs will adhere to the
API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
Friend information when you Refer a Friend or participate in Social:
When you refer a friend to join Fetch we provide you a link, some
  pre-formatted text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend.
  You send your friend the link, along with the pre-formatted text, and referral
  code on your own, and you do not share any of your friend's information with
  Fetch.
Refer a Friend: If your friends sign up using the "refer a friend" referral
    code that you as your friends' advocate provided, we will let them know that
    their advocate has received points for the referral, and we will let you
    know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their
    first receipt.
Social: If your friends sign up using a referral code inviting them to be
    your Fetch friend, after that friend enters your referral code, they will be
    added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list
    of Fetch friends in Fetch Social.
If you invite someone to be a friend who is already a Fetch member, we
        will provide your friend a push notification, which will take them to
        the Fetch App where they can accept your invitation. If they accept, we
        will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you
        will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends.
We collect and display in each Fetch Social feed and leaderboard, the
        user names and profile photos of the friends with whom you directly
        connect, along with certain Fetch activity information.
We collect information about the people, pages, account activity, and
        groups you are connected to and how you interact with them on our App.
For GoodRx Participants:
We distribute GoodRx Cards through our App on
  behalf of GoodRx, Inc. that contain certain GoodRx information, including BIN,
  PCN, Group, and Member ID. You choose whether to activate your GoodRx Card by
  making a GoodRx Claim. When you activate your Good Rx Card, we provide your
  GoodRx Card information, name, and email address to GoodRx to enable you to
  engage with GoodRx and facilitate your relationship with GoodRx. The
GoodRx Privacy Policy
governs your relationship with GoodRx. When you activate your GoodRx Card and
  make GoodRx Claims, you direct GoodRx to provide Fetch your GoodRx Card Member
  ID and information relating to your transactions, including the pharmacy name
  and zip code and amount of savings associated with your GoodRx Claims, so that
  Fetch can provide you points.
For Fetch Shop Extension Users
: Fetch offers a downloadable browser extension, available for the Chrome and Safari browsers, that enables Fetch users with visibility to Fetch Shop opportunities as they browse the web. When using the Fetch Shop browser extension, Fetch will collect the following information about the user: browsing history; Fetch user ID; and transaction details. This information is collected and used to perform the services (i.e. deliver Fetch Points for qualifying Fetch Shop purchases) and for analytics and site improvement. Information obtained through the browser extension will not be used for any other purpose, and will not be shared or sold with any third party except as necessary to perform the services. The Fetch Shop browser extension maybe disabled or uninstalled at any time without penalty to the user, at which point all further collection of user information through the extension will cease.
Information from Other Sources
We may collect data that is publicly available such as information you have
  submitted in public forums, including social media platforms. We may also
  collect information from third parties such as demographic information and
  other information that can enhance our existing information about you. We use
  this information to provide you services and to improve the products and
  services we deliver to you, including to prevent fraud and/or to verify your
  identity.
Retention Periods
The period of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for
  which we collect or use that information. We will delete or de-identify
  information when it is no longer needed to fulfill the purposes listed for
  each category above, unless a longer retention period is required to comply
  with applicable laws. There may be technical or other operational reasons
  where we are unable to fully delete or de-identify your information. Where
  this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to prevent further
  processing your information.
Your Consent to Disclose Your Personal Information
By utilizing the Fetch App, requesting Fetch Services or by providing your
  information to Fetch, you are agreeing, consenting to, and directing Fetch to
  disclose your information with our Brand Partners. In operating our business
  and working to provide you the best products and services, unless specified
  otherwise elsewhere, you agree, consent to and direct Fetch to share your
  information in the following ways:
Brand Partners
With our participating brands:
When you use our App and participate in
  our program, you direct us to provide information you give us by registering
  and earning rewards to all participating brands who provide points in our
  Program and who can engage with you, including by sending you emails, and use
  your personal information in accordance with their privacy policies regardless
  of your actual interaction with each. For a list of our participating brands,
  click
here
. In addition, by uploading receipts,
  redeeming a Special Offer, participating in a Challenge, or taking a Survey
  offered by a Partner, you are using Fetch Rewards™ to intentionally interact
  with all our participating brands who provide points in our Program. Fetch
  does not share your phone number with any participating brands. For more
  details about the terms of our Program click here to review our
Terms of Service
.
What Value Do You Receive from Participating in Our Program?
Our program allows you to direct us to share your personal information you
  provide us when registering and earning rewards with all our participating
  brands so that you can interact with them to earn points. The value you
  receive in participating in our Program is calculated by and depends on the
  amount and nature of your interaction with our participating brands to obtain
  points.
Opting-Out
The disclosure of your information to participating brands may be considered the sale or sharing of personal data under applicable privacy law. If you no longer wish to share your personal information with all our participating brands, you may opt-out of such sharing through Fetch’s
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
link.
With third parties to facilitate their provision of services to you:
When you engage third party services like GoodRx through our App, we share
  your information with those third parties in order to facilitate your
  relationship with them.
With your friends or other Fetch members participating in Social:
If
  you entered a referral code, we will notify the person to whom Fetch issued
  the referral code that you entered it and both of you will be added to each
  others' friends list. Friends who are directly connected will share between
  them their user names, profile photo, state, number of friends and mutual
  friends, total dollars spent on a receipt, points earned, top brands for which
  points were earned, the store/merchant from which a receipt was scanned, the
  chosen Rewards for which points were redeemed, point-earning activities
  engaged in, the date on which each activity occurred, information about Social
  Offers in which you and your friends are participating, and other information,
  as disclosed to you from time to time. In addition, friends of your friends
  with whom you are not directly connected (i.e. Friends of Friends) and users
  with whom you are not directly or indirectly connected, will be able to see
  your name, profile picture, state, number of friends and mutual friends,
  limited information about Points-earning activities you've engaged in, and
  Fetch points. Fetch members can also search for friends with whom they can
  connect on Social by providing a friend's email address or telephone number.
  If your email address or phone number matches a Fetch member's search, we will
  share your name and profile photo so that member can invite you to be a friend
  and/or join a Social group.
To stop sharing information with your friends in Fetch Social, you can
  disconnect yourself from specific friends or all friends with whom you are
  directly connected. This will delete all information relating to you in your
  Friend's feed and leaderboard.
With other users as part of the referral program:
By providing your
  referral code or referral link to another user, or by entering a referral code
  or referral link from another user, you agree that this will form a digital
  relationship between your accounts, and that your name or other personal
  information may be shared with that user, either in-app or by our customer
  support team.

Certain states provide the right to request our disclosure of any of the
  following:

the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing with
    third parties for cross context behavioral advertising (e.g., targeted
    advertising);
the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
You can do this through a verified consumer request.
That process is described below in the section, "How to Exercise Your
    Rights."
Your Right to Request Correction of Inaccurate Personal Information
Certain states provide you the right to request correction of inaccurate
  personal information maintained by us. We may request documentation from you
  to determine the accuracy of the information. If you provide us documentation
  either upon our request or through your own initiative, that documentation
  will only be used for the purpose of correcting your personal information and
  complying with our recordkeeping requirements.
As an alternative to correction, we may delete the inaccurate information if
  it does not negatively impact you or if you consent to this deletion. We
  reserve the right to deny this request if allowed under applicable law, or if
  we determine that the contested information is more likely than not accurate,
  based on the totality of circumstances. You can submit a correction request
  through a verified consumer request. That process is described below in the
  section, " How to Exercise Your Rights."
Your Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
Certain states provide the right to request that we delete any of your
  personal information, subject to certain exceptions. You can do this through a
  verified consumer request. That process is described below in the section,
  "How to Exercise Your Rights."
There may be scenarios where we deny your deletion request. If that occurs, we
  will provide you with an explanation as to why we could not delete all or some
  of your personal information.
How to Exercise Your Rights
You may exercise your rights, as applicable, by submitting a verified consumer
  request to know information (and to receive your personal information in a
  portable format), to correct information, or for deletion.
The response to a request to know will provide the personal information we
  have collected and maintained about you, in a portable format, unless an
  exception under applicable state law applies. Please note that, depending on
  the applicable state law, we may not be required to provide personal
  information to you if you make multiple requests in a certain time period. We
  cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we
  cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request. We will only use
  personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
  requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
A form is available at this
link
to request your personal information or request to delete or correct your
  personal information. You can also place a request by email us at
privacy@fetch.com
. If you email your
  request, we ask that you provide the same information requested on the webform
  in order for us to authenticate your request. Your request either through the
  webform or via email will be verified using information you provide as
  described on the webform.
If you submit a request that is not through one of the above designated
  methods or is deficient in some manner unrelated to verification, we will
  provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any
  deficiencies with your request.
Once we receive your verifiable consumer request, we will confirm receipt of
  the request within 10 business days, or as allowed under applicable law,
  describing our verification process. We will respond to your request within 45
  calendar days, or as allowed under applicable law, if we are able to verify
  your identity. Requests for deletion will require a separate confirmation that
  you want your information deleted.
If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written response to that
  account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written
  response by mail or electronically, at your option. Making a verifiable
  consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However,
  we do consider requests made through your password protected account
  sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information
  associated with that specific account.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
  request, if applicable. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
  will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate
  before completing your request.

  collect information of minors under the age of 13.

  receipts you receive electronically. The Digital Receipt Program allows you to
  link other email accounts or digital consumer accounts to your Fetch account,

  account(s) so that Fetch, as your agent, can retrieve purchase information
  from digital receipts in your digital consumer account or email.

        to improve user-facing features on the App or Website such as letting
        you know ways to earn points or bonus points.

Friend information when you Refer a Friend or participate in Social:

  You send your friend the link, along with the pre-formatted text, and referral
  code on your own, and you do not share any of your friend's information with
  Fetch.
Refer a Friend: If your friends sign up using the "refer a friend" referral
    code that you as your friends' advocate provided, we will let them know that
    their advocate has received points for the referral, and we will let you
    know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their
    first receipt.
Social: If your friends sign up using a referral code inviting them to be
    your Fetch friend, after that friend enters your referral code, they will be
    added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list
    of Fetch friends in Fetch Social.
If you invite someone to be a friend who is already a Fetch member, we
        will provide your friend a push notification, which will take them to
        the Fetch App where they can accept your invitation. If they accept, we
        will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you
        will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends.
We collect and display in each Fetch Social feed and leaderboard, the
        user names and profile photos of the friends with whom you directly
        connect, along with certain Fetch activity information.

  Fetch can provide you points.

  this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to prevent further
  processing your information.

  brands so that you can interact with them to earn points. The value you
  receive in participating in our Program is calculated by and depends on the
  amount and nature of your interaction with our participating brands to obtain
  points.

Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
link.
With third parties to facilitate their provision of services to you:
When you engage third party services like GoodRx through our App, we share
  your information with those third parties in order to facilitate your
  relationship with them.
With your friends or other Fetch members participating in Social:
If
  you entered a referral code, we will notify the person to whom Fetch issued
  the referral code that you entered it and both of you will be added to each
  others' friends list. Friends who are directly connected will share between
  them their user names, profile photo, state, number of friends and mutual
  friends, total dollars spent on a receipt, points earned, top brands for which
  points were earned, the store/merchant from which a receipt was scanned, the
  chosen Rewards for which points were redeemed, point-earning activities
  engaged in, the date on which each activity occurred, information about Social
  Offers in which you and your friends are participating, and other information,
  as disclosed to you from time to time. In addition, friends of your friends
  with whom you are not directly connected (i.e. Friends of Friends) and users
  with whom you are not directly or indirectly connected, will be able to see
  your name, profile picture, state, number of friends and mutual friends,
  limited information about Points-earning activities you've engaged in, and
  Fetch points. Fetch members can also search for friends with whom they can
  connect on Social by providing a friend's email address or telephone number.
  If your email address or phone number matches a Fetch member's search, we will
  share your name and profile photo so that member can invite you to be a friend
  and/or join a Social group.
To stop sharing information with your friends in Fetch Social, you can
  disconnect yourself from specific friends or all friends with whom you are
  directly connected. This will delete all information relating to you in your
  Friend's feed and leaderboard.
With other users as part of the referral program:
By providing your
  referral code or referral link to another user, or by entering a referral code
  or referral link from another user, you agree that this will form a digital
  relationship between your accounts, and that your name or other personal
  information may be shared with that user, either in-app or by our customer
  support team.

Your Right to Know
Certain states provide the right to request our disclosure of any of the
  following:
the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing with
    third parties for cross context behavioral advertising (e.g., targeted
    advertising);
the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
You can do this through a verified consumer request.
That process is described below in the section, "How to Exercise Your
    Rights."
Your Right to Request Correction of Inaccurate Personal Information
Certain states provide you the right to request correction of inaccurate
  personal information maintained by us. We may request documentation from you
  to determine the accuracy of the information. If you provide us documentation
  either upon our request or through your own initiative, that documentation
  will only be used for the purpose of correcting your personal information and
  complying with our recordkeeping requirements.
As an alternative to correction, we may delete the inaccurate information if
  it does not negatively impact you or if you consent to this deletion. We
  reserve the right to deny this request if allowed under applicable law, or if
  we determine that the contested information is more likely than not accurate,
  based on the totality of circumstances. You can submit a correction request
  through a verified consumer request. That process is described below in the
  section, " How to Exercise Your Rights."
Your Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
Certain states provide the right to request that we delete any of your
  personal information, subject to certain exceptions. You can do this through a
  verified consumer request. That process is described below in the section,
  "How to Exercise Your Rights."
There may be scenarios where we deny your deletion request. If that occurs, we
  will provide you with an explanation as to why we could not delete all or some
  of your personal information.
How to Exercise Your Rights
You may exercise your rights, as applicable, by submitting a verified consumer
  request to know information (and to receive your personal information in a
  portable format), to correct information, or for deletion.
The response to a request to know will provide the personal information we
  have collected and maintained about you, in a portable format, unless an
  exception under applicable state law applies. Please note that, depending on
  the applicable state law, we may not be required to provide personal
  information to you if you make multiple requests in a certain time period. We
  cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we
  cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request. We will only use
  personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
  requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
A form is available at this
link
to request your personal information or request to delete or correct your
  personal information. You can also place a request by email us at
privacy@fetch.com
. If you email your
  request, we ask that you provide the same information requested on the webform
  in order for us to authenticate your request. Your request either through the
  webform or via email will be verified using information you provide as
  described on the webform.
If you submit a request that is not through one of the above designated
  methods or is deficient in some manner unrelated to verification, we will
  provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any
  deficiencies with your request.
Once we receive your verifiable consumer request, we will confirm receipt of
  the request within 10 business days, or as allowed under applicable law,
  describing our verification process. We will respond to your request within 45
  calendar days, or as allowed under applicable law, if we are able to verify
  your identity. Requests for deletion will require a separate confirmation that
  you want your information deleted.
If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written response to that
  account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written
  response by mail or electronically, at your option. Making a verifiable
  consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However,
  we do consider requests made through your password protected account
  sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information
  associated with that specific account.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
  request, if applicable. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
  will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate
  before completing your request.
Requests to Know or Delete for Child Under the Age of 13: We do not knowingly
  collect information of minors under the age of 13.
No Collection of Personal Information from Children Under 13 Years Old

  or to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information. If
  you use an authorized agent, you may provide a power of attorney executed

  attorney that meets those provisions is not submitted, you will be required to
  provide the authorized agent signed permission to submit a request, verify
  your identity directly by submitting a verified consumer request according to
  the procedures in the section "How to Exercise Your Rights," and directly
  confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit
  the request. To submit authorized agent documentation, contact us at

  identification of your identity and evidence of your authorized agent’s
  authority to act on your behalf. For example, you may need to provide the
  authorized agent signed permission to submit a request, verify your identity
  directly by submitting a verified consumer request according to the procedures
  in the section "How to Exercise Your Rights," and directly confirm with us
  that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request, by

          determine a device's physical location.

The physical location is used to provide you with a variety of
          services such as personalized content and/or advertising. We may
          communicate with you based on your location, and when we do so, we do

          geo-location as a basis for sending you text or SMS messages. If you
          do not want to receive push notifications, you can disable that
          through your Fetch App Settings. You may opt out of using location
          services using your device's functionality to do so, but this may
          degrade the features and functionality that we can provide. Separate
          from precise geo-location options, our App [constantly or when the App

          detection purposes.

Program-Specific Information Collection
The information we collect varies depending on the type of activity you are
  performing and helps us provide you the products and services you request,
  personalize and improve your experience and allows us to provide you with
  opportunities to learn about products and services that may interest you. For
  example:
For Digital Receipt Program ("eReceipts") participants:
We may collect
  consumer account or email log-in credentials and any personal information
  contained on digital receipts.
We use the information you provide us in connection with our Digital Receipt
  Program (Titled "eReceipts" in the Services) to provide you points relating to
  receipts you receive electronically. The Digital Receipt Program allows you to
  link other email accounts or digital consumer accounts to your Fetch account,
  as directed by you, through the use of your login credentials to that
  account(s) so that Fetch, as your agent, can retrieve purchase information
  from digital receipts in your digital consumer account or email.
We will only collect and/or disclose receipt and other related information
    in your email if you consent by signing up for this program.
You may revoke your consent to the Digital Receipt Program by disabling your
  participation through the App.
In processing your Digital Receipts, Fetch may retrieve Personal Information
  such as billing address, mailing address, name, payment method, and other
  information contained in the Digital Receipt email. Fetch may scan for any
  data believed to be a receipt in those email accounts or the linked consumer
  account.
For Gmail Users

API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements, and use information collected
        through your participation in our eReceipts program from your Gmail
        account only to provide you points for your purchases on behalf of our
        participating brands and to improve user-facing features on the App or
        Website such as letting you know ways to earn points or bonus points.
For Yahoo Users
We comply with the
Yahoo Developer API Terms of Use
and
related policies
, to ensure that information collected through your participation in
        our eReceipts program from your Yahoo account is only used to provide
        you points for your purchases on behalf of our participating brands and
        to improve user-facing features on the App or Website such as letting
        you know ways to earn points or bonus points.
Our use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google
    APIs will adhere to the
API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
Friend information when you Refer a Friend or participate in Social:
When you refer a friend to join Fetch we provide you a link, some
  pre-formatted text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend.
  You send your friend the link, along with the pre-formatted text, and referral
  code on your own, and you do not share any of your friend's information with
  Fetch.
Refer a Friend: If your friends sign up using the "refer a friend" referral
    code that you as your friends' advocate provided, we will let them know that
    their advocate has received points for the referral, and we will let you
    know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their
    first receipt.
Social: If your friends sign up using a referral code inviting them to be
    your Fetch friend, after that friend enters your referral code, they will be
    added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list
    of Fetch friends in Fetch Social.
If you invite someone to be a friend who is already a Fetch member, we
        will provide your friend a push notification, which will take them to
        the Fetch App where they can accept your invitation. If they accept, we
        will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you
        will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends.
We collect and display in each Fetch Social feed and leaderboard, the
        user names and profile photos of the friends with whom you directly
        connect, along with certain Fetch activity information.
We collect information about the people, pages, account activity, and
        groups you are connected to and how you interact with them on our App.
For GoodRx Participants:
We distribute GoodRx Cards through our App on
  behalf of GoodRx, Inc. that contain certain GoodRx information, including BIN,
  PCN, Group, and Member ID. You choose whether to activate your GoodRx Card by
  making a GoodRx Claim. When you activate your Good Rx Card, we provide your
  GoodRx Card information, name, and email address to GoodRx to enable you to
  engage with GoodRx and facilitate your relationship with GoodRx. The
GoodRx Privacy Policy
governs your relationship with GoodRx. When you activate your GoodRx Card and
  make GoodRx Claims, you direct GoodRx to provide Fetch your GoodRx Card Member
  ID and information relating to your transactions, including the pharmacy name
  and zip code and amount of savings associated with your GoodRx Claims, so that
  Fetch can provide you points.

  which we collect or use that information. We will delete or de-identify
  information when it is no longer needed to fulfill the purposes listed for
  each category above, unless a longer retention period is required to comply
  with applicable laws. There may be technical or other operational reasons
  where we are unable to fully delete or de-identify your information. Where
  this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to prevent further
  processing your information.
Your Consent to Disclose Your Personal Information
By utilizing the Fetch App, requesting Fetch Services or by providing your
  information to Fetch, you are agreeing, consenting to, and directing Fetch to
  disclose your information with our Brand Partners. In operating our business
  and working to provide you the best products and services, unless specified
  otherwise elsewhere, you agree, consent to and direct Fetch to share your
  information in the following ways:
Brand Partners
With our participating brands:
When you use our App and participate in
  our program, you direct us to provide information you give us by registering
  and earning rewards to all participating brands who provide points in our
  Program and who can engage with you, including by sending you emails, and use
  your personal information in accordance with their privacy policies regardless
  of your actual interaction with each. For a list of our participating brands,
  click
here
. In addition, by uploading receipts,
  redeeming a Special Offer, participating in a Challenge, or taking a Survey
  offered by a Partner, you are using Fetch Rewards™ to intentionally interact
  with all our participating brands who provide points in our Program. Fetch
  does not share your phone number with any participating brands. For more
  details about the terms of our Program click here to review our
Terms of Service
.
What Value Do You Receive from Participating in Our Program?
Our program allows you to direct us to share your personal information you
  provide us when registering and earning rewards with all our participating
  brands so that you can interact with them to earn points. The value you
  receive in participating in our Program is calculated by and depends on the
  amount and nature of your interaction with our participating brands to obtain
  points.
Opting-Out
The disclosure of your information to participating brands may be considered the sale or sharing of personal data under applicable privacy law. If you no longer wish to share your personal information with all our participating brands, you may opt-out of such sharing through Fetch’s
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
link.
With third parties to facilitate their provision of services to you:
When you engage third party services like GoodRx through our App, we share
  your information with those third parties in order to facilitate your
  relationship with them.
With your friends or other Fetch members participating in Social:
If
  you entered a referral code, we will notify the person to whom Fetch issued
  the referral code that you entered it and both of you will be added to each
  others' friends list. Friends who are directly connected will share between
  them their user names, profile photo, state, number of friends and mutual
  friends, total dollars spent on a receipt, points earned, top brands for which
  points were earned, the store/merchant from which a receipt was scanned, the
  chosen Rewards for which points were redeemed, point-earning activities
  engaged in, the date on which each activity occurred, information about Social
  Offers in which you and your friends are participating, and other information,
  as disclosed to you from time to time. In addition, friends of your friends
  with whom you are not directly connected (i.e. Friends of Friends) and users
  with whom you are not directly or indirectly connected, will be able to see
  your name, profile picture, state, number of friends and mutual friends,
  limited information about Points-earning activities you've engaged in, and
  Fetch points. Fetch members can also search for friends with whom they can
  connect on Social by providing a friend's email address or telephone number.
  If your email address or phone number matches a Fetch member's search, we will
  share your name and profile photo so that member can invite you to be a friend
  and/or join a Social group.
To stop sharing information with your friends in Fetch Social, you can
  disconnect yourself from specific friends or all friends with whom you are
  directly connected. This will delete all information relating to you in your
  Friend's feed and leaderboard.
With other users as part of the referral program:
By providing your
  referral code or referral link to another user, or by entering a referral code
  or referral link from another user, you agree that this will form a digital
  relationship between your accounts, and that your name or other personal
  information may be shared with that user, either in-app or by our customer
  support team.

  verified consumer request. That process is described below in the section,
  "How to Exercise Your Rights."
There may be scenarios where we deny your deletion request. If that occurs, we
  will provide you with an explanation as to why we could not delete all or some
  of your personal information.
How to Exercise Your Rights
You may exercise your rights, as applicable, by submitting a verified consumer
  request to know information (and to receive your personal information in a
  portable format), to correct information, or for deletion.
The response to a request to know will provide the personal information we
  have collected and maintained about you, in a portable format, unless an
  exception under applicable state law applies. Please note that, depending on
  the applicable state law, we may not be required to provide personal
  information to you if you make multiple requests in a certain time period. We
  cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we
  cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request. We will only use
  personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
  requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
A form is available at this
link
to request your personal information or request to delete or correct your
  personal information. You can also place a request by email us at
privacy@fetch.com
. If you email your
  request, we ask that you provide the same information requested on the webform
  in order for us to authenticate your request. Your request either through the
  webform or via email will be verified using information you provide as
  described on the webform.
If you submit a request that is not through one of the above designated
  methods or is deficient in some manner unrelated to verification, we will
  provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any
  deficiencies with your request.
Once we receive your verifiable consumer request, we will confirm receipt of
  the request within 10 business days, or as allowed under applicable law,
  describing our verification process. We will respond to your request within 45
  calendar days, or as allowed under applicable law, if we are able to verify
  your identity. Requests for deletion will require a separate confirmation that
  you want your information deleted.
If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written response to that
  account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written
  response by mail or electronically, at your option. Making a verifiable
  consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However,
  we do consider requests made through your password protected account
  sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information
  associated with that specific account.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
  request, if applicable. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
  will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate
  before completing your request.
Requests to Know or Delete for Child Under the Age of 13: We do not knowingly
  collect information of minors under the age of 13.
No Collection of Personal Information from Children Under 13 Years Old
Fetch's App and Website are not targeted to children under 13 years old, and
  it does not intend to collect Personal Information from children under the age
  of 13. If you are aware of a user under the age of 13 who has provided
  Personal Information to Fetch, please contact us at
privacy@fetch.com
. Parents and legal
  guardians may choose to provide information about their children, even if
  under the age of 13, for the purposes of using our products and services,
  including, without limitation, the App and Website.
Using an Authorized Agent to Submit a Request
California:
Only you, or a natural person or a business entity
  registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California that
  you have authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
  request related to your personal information, to opt-out of sale or sharing,
  or to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information. If
  you use an authorized agent, you may provide a power of attorney executed
  pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. If a power of
  attorney that meets those provisions is not submitted, you will be required to
  provide the authorized agent signed permission to submit a request, verify
  your identity directly by submitting a verified consumer request according to
  the procedures in the section "How to Exercise Your Rights," and directly
  confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit
  the request. To submit authorized agent documentation, contact us at
privacy@fetch.com
.
Other States:
If you use an authorized agent, you may provide a power
  of attorney executed pursuant to applicable state law. If a power of attorney
  is not submitted, you may be required to provide commercially reasonable
  identification of your identity and evidence of your authorized agent’s
  authority to act on your behalf. For example, you may need to provide the
  authorized agent signed permission to submit a request, verify your identity
  directly by submitting a verified consumer request according to the procedures
  in the section "How to Exercise Your Rights," and directly confirm with us
  that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request, by
  contacting us at
privacy@fetch.com
.

Notice of Financial Incentive/Loyalty Program
The purpose of this notice of financial incentive/loyalty program is to
  explain to you the material terms of a financial incentive we are offering so
  that you may make an informed decision on whether to participate.
We currently provide the following financial incentives:
Under the CCPA, because your participation in our Program enables you to earn
  points, it is considered a financial incentive program. In order to provide
  you points, you direct us to use and share the personal information you
  provide when you register along with your activity information with all our
  participating brands so that you can interact with them and earn points. The
  value you receive in participating in our Program is calculated by and depends
  on the amount and nature of your interaction with our participating brands to
  obtain points. Points do not have monetary value, and the value may vary from time to time.
Note that participation in Fetch Rewards is completely voluntary and you can
  withdraw or opt-out at any time. For further details of the Program and its
  terms, including how to withdraw or terminate your participation, please refer
  to our
Terms of Service
.
Your Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Privacy Right
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your state privacy
  rights. However, we may still offer you certain financial incentives permitted
  under applicable state law, such as discounts, rewards, premium features,
  loyalty accounts, or club card programs that can result in different prices,
  rates, or quality levels.
International Use
The Services are hosted and intended for users located within the United
  States. Our Services are not directed at or offered to residents outside the
  United States. In using the Services, you acknowledge this and recognize and
  agree that your Data will be transferred to the United States for storage and
  processing under the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Supplemental U.S. State Privacy Rights
In addition to the privacy rights listed above, certain states provide
  supplemental privacy rights to residents of those states.
Right to Opt-Out of Certain Profiling
You have the right to opt-out of our use of profiling when used to make
  decisions that produce a legal or similarly significant effect concerning you
  or your interactions with us. Currently, we do not engage in such profiling.
Right to Appeal
You have the right to appeal our refusal to take action on, or respond to, a
  verified consumer request. Upon receipt of our denial or refusal to take
  action on, or to respond to, a verified consumer request, a consumer has 60
  days to submit a request to appeal our decision by email, using the subject
  line “Privacy Request Decision Appeal”. We will timely inform you in writing
  of any action taken or not taken in response. We will also include a written
  explanation of the reasons for our decision.
Changes to Our Privacy Notice
We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any
  time. When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will post the updated
  notice on the Website and update the notice's effective date. Your continued
  use of our Website following the posting of changes constitutes your
  acceptance of such changes.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
