Privacy Policy
Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand how PixConverter deals with the personally identifiable information ('PII') you may
occasionally provide to us via the Internet.
Generally, we do not collect any PII from you when you download our applications. To be specific, we do not require the consumers to get registered before downloading the application, nor do we keep track of the consumers' visits to our application, we even don't have a Server to store such PII.
PixConverter will never collect and store any face data when you use our application. And any PII can not be shared with any third parties.
The only situation we may get access to your PII is when you personally decide to email us your feedback or to provide us with a bug report. The PII we may get from you in that situation is strictly limited to your name, email address, and your survey response only.
In the above situation, we guarantee that your PII will only be used for contacting you and improving our services. We will never use such information (e.g. your name and email address) for any other purposes, such as to further market our products or to disclose your personal information to a third party for commercial gains.
It should be noted that whether or not to send us your feedback or bug report is a completely voluntary initiative upon your own decision. If you have a concern about your PII being misused, or if you want further information about our privacy policy and what it means, please feel free to email us in “Setting”- “Feedback”, we will endeavor to provide clear answers to your questions in a timely manner.
In addition, you can revoke the PixConverter access to your data via the Google security settings page at https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
