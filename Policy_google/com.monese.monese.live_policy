Privacy notice for personal account customers
Personal
Business
This privacy notice explains what personal data we collect, what we do with it, who we share it with, how long we keep it for and what legal rights you have.
For UK customers, Monese Ltd and Monese Finance Ltd are what are known as the data controllers of your personal data. This means they are responsible for deciding how your personal information is used, and for our credit and insurance products they do this jointly.
For customers in the European Economic Area (EEA), Monese EU is the data controller of your personal data.
When we refer to “Monese”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this notice, it is a reference to the companies mentioned above, depending on where you are based. If you are not sure which is the relevant company, please check your account terms or contact Monese’s Data Protection Officer (see below). Certain sections of this notice may only apply to customers who hold certain accounts with us (for example, Credit Products). If this is the case, we have made this clear in this privacy notice.
1. The personal data we hold about you
Your identity and contact data
This includes personal information about you (for example your name, date of birth, residential address, nationality, passport number) and your contact details.
In most cases the information is provided by you during the set up and management of Monese services, in the form of identity documents, your video selfie and any other personal data you have shared with us. In some cases, it may be provided by a third party where you have given your consent for them to share it with us.
We may be provided with additional identity and contact data by third parties that we use to perform due diligence (for example, fraud prevention agencies). In addition, we may source identity and contact data from publicly available sources such as Companies House and Electoral Registers.
Financial and service data
This is information about your Monese accounts, related debit cards and any other products and services that you have obtained from us. It includes things like account numbers, account balances and information about transactions. The information is generated as you use our services and in some cases it is shared with us by the organisations we use to provide our services.
Where you have linked your Monese account to one of our partner services (for example the Avios rewards programme) we may hold financial data for these services.
Information you permit us to access on your phone
This is information stored on your phone that you explicitly permit us to access (for example, your address book, photos and geolocation data).
Technical data
This is information about the phone you use (for example the browser version, time zone settings, phone operating system, IMEI number, IP address and other technical settings). This information is collected automatically when you use the Monese app.
Analytics
This includes information about how you interact with our services. We collect this information automatically when you visit our website or use the Monese app. Our use of cookies to help us achieve this is explained in our
cookie policy
.
Special category data
This is information that is considered more sensitive by regulators and includes your race, ethnic origin, political views, religion, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health and sexual orientation. With the exception of the video selfie and photo ID that you provide so we can verify your identity, we do not process this category of data. However, it is possible that we may hold special category data when you provide it to us, e.g. if it is included on documentation (for example your ID document) or when third parties provide it to us (for example details of criminal activities from the police). When this is the case, we will only process this information in strict accordance with the law.
2. What do we do with your personal data
We only use your personal data in order to provide great financial services and where there is a lawful basis to do so.
To fulfil our contract with you, we will use your personal data to:
Administer and provide our financial and other related services (for example, account top-ups, payments, direct debits, standing orders and international transfers, as well as additional account benefit services).
To develop and provide a high-quality user experience through the Monese app.
To fulfil our legal obligations we will use your personal data to:
Verify your identity when you apply for a Monese account.
Check applications against certain fraud prevention and sanctions databases.
Implement measures to identify and prevent financial crime (for example, money laundering, fraud and terrorist financing).
To make responsible lending decisions.
It is in our legitimate interests to use your personal data to:
Keep you informed of the status of the Monese services you use.
Provide a world class customer service experience.
Perform a soft credit search to assess your suitability for our services.
Check applications against certain fraud prevention databases.
When we and fraud prevention agencies process your personal data, we do so on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, in order to protect our business and to comply with the laws that apply to us. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have requested.
As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct; or is inconsistent with your previous submissions; or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. You have rights in relation to automated decision making: if you want to know more please contact us using the details below. We also utilise the latest technology to make automated decisions for the verification of identities and the identification of financial crime. You can contact us to ask for a person to review an automated decision.
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services and financing you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you.
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests, we will use your personal data to:
Provide you with information about Monese products and services that we think you may like. This only applies where you have signed up for a Monese account after 10 August 2020, otherwise we will only provide you with this information if you have provided your consent.
Undertake analysis on our customers to better understand how to improve our products and services. This may involve us processing your data (including your transactions) or working with third parties (in which case we will not directly identify you or any other customers) to help better profile our customers and improve how we market our products. We will ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place with such third parties so that your data is kept secure. See below for more information about processing by third party advertising partners for Monese’s analytics purposes.
With your consent, we will use your personal data to:
Provide you with information about Monese products and services that we think you may like. This only applies if you signed up for a Monese account prior to 10 August 2020, otherwise we rely on our legitimate interests as described below.
Invite you to participate in market research activities (such as focus groups, interviews and surveys).
Provide you with information about third party products and services that we think you may like.
Market our products.
Operate our Hub (where you may choose to take advantage of a wide range of our partners’ products and services).
If we ask you for permission to process your personal data, you can refuse, or withdraw your permission at any time, by using the details at the end of this privacy notice or, if in relation to cookies or similar, through the cookie policy. To withdraw your consent to receive marketing message, you can set your preferences in the Monese app settings, or by following the opt-out link contained in marketing emails.

and privacy.
Privacy is at the center of everything we do.
Apple Search Ads has been built from the ground up to respect privacy. Our advertising platform is designed to protect users’ information and give them control over how we use it for advertising.
No user tracking or
data sharing
Apple Search Ads doesn’t buy or share users’ personal information with other companies. We don’t track people by linking user or device data collected from Apple apps with user or device data collected from third parties for advertising targeting or measurement. And we don’t share user or device data with data brokers.
Users’ Apple Pay transactions, Health app data, and HomeKit app data are not used by Apple Search Ads to deliver ads.
Easy control for users
Users may view and limit the information Apple uses to deliver relevant ads to them, by choosing whether to enable the Personalized Ads setting. They may also choose whether location-based information can be used to determine which ads they see.
More about ad preferences
Minors protected
Apple Search Ads doesn’t serve ads to any user whose Apple Account is registered to a minor under 13 years of age or set up as a Managed Apple Account. Nor do we collect, use, or disclose any information from them.
Apple Search Ads also doesn’t allow explicit targeting of people whose Apple Account is registered to a user under the age of 18.
Safe content
Every app on the App Store goes through a thorough review, as do the assets used to promote it. Only these approved assets can be used in Apple Search Ads campaigns.
Transparency and
disclosure
All ads have an “Ad” mark so customers can identify the ads as paid placements. They can tap this mark to see the information used to serve the ad.
How we connect customers and advertisers.
Apple Search Ads empowers advertisers, while protecting individuals.
Advertisers have the ability to deliver targeted ads to customer segments, which are groups of people with similar characteristics. Each segment must contain at least 5000 people, which ensures that no customer can be individually targeted.
To ensure we deliver the most relevant ads, Apple Search Ads may use the following:
Account Information
This includes the information a customer includes in their Apple Account.
App Store Data
This includes information provided by developers to define and categorize their apps. It also includes insights derived from non-personal historical search terms, App Store downloads, App Store browsing activity, and in-app purchases made through the App Store.
App Transaction Data
This includes historical information about users’ transactions on the App Store, including apps they’ve downloaded and in-app purchases they’ve made.
Contextual Information
This includes a customer’s device type, iOS version, time of day, device location, search query, and information about the page they’re viewing, or app they're downloading.

We use data analytics to help our clients (advertisers, media agencies, brands) to advertise their ads on various websites that allow third party advertising, so called ‘publishers’. We develop insights into the browsing behaviour of website users for our clients or for publishers in order to develop targeted digital advertising campaigns for our clients that create a better user experience.
We participate in various industry schemes that are designed to ensure that any user-level personal data we process for these purposes is collected and processed on the basis of the user’s consent.
We also collect and process personal data about visitors to our own website (

We may source, use and otherwise process personal data in different ways in regard to each of these data subject categories, as explained in the following sections:
3.1 Visitors to publishers' websites
A – Sources of personal data
B – Personal data that we collect and process
C – Why do we collect your personal data and what are our lawful bases for it?
D – How long do we keep your personal data?
MiQ analyses web browsing usage in order to provide our clients (advertisers and media agencies) with the ability to improve returns on their digital advertising spend by enabling them to serve ads that are relevant to website visitors.We use cookies and similar applications to develop marketing insights about user preferences, sometime in combination with other data sets, in order to better match ad content with user interests.
A – Sources of personal data
The websites that users visit may allow third parties, such as MiQ, to set cookies or similar applications on user devices or browsers when they visit the websites. We collect and analyse the data obtained via these applications. We may combine this data with aggregate data obtained from social media companies and market research firms, and user-level data from other advertising technology companies that support our services in various ways, such as fraud prevention through the detection of “bots.”

IP address, which helps us to understand the broad location of a user
Device ID (when users access websites on mobile devices), such as IDFA, AAID, SHA1

Latitude-longitude location data
Timestamp on accessing the website and the website URL
Enrichment data collected about you from third parties, such as Nielsen & Eyeota.
Tweets & Twitter handles, made publicly available via the Twitter platform
User interactions with the ad placed, i.e. we will know if a user clicks on it or the user’s browser & operating system type. Sometimes advertisers may provide us with information on what users have previously purchased from them and when, in order to make our predictions more accurate.
Cookie technology is placed on devices to assist with the ad delivery process. This includes:
1. A user ID cookie to support ad personalisation, which lasts for 90 days
2. An opt-out cookie to store your opt-out and consent preferences, which lasts for 90 days
3. A session cookie to see if a browser supports cookies, which lasts for 1 browsing session

Although we do not collect information that directly identifies individual users by name or physical address, we collect your IP address and other information about you which may make this information personal data. For example, based on a user’s historic browsing behaviour, we may map an IP address to a city or a geographical region and other information such as weather in that region, in order to predict users’ future buying decisions.
However, we never make decisions or predictions based on the characteristics of one individual. Instead we usually only target population segments or groups of individuals.  These segments involve aggregated user data of no less than 1,500 users, but more typically hundreds of thousands of users who may share common characteristics, such as demographics and specific interests, such as preferences for particular types of cars.
C – Why do we collect your personal data and what are our lawful bases for it?
We collect user-level personal data so that users can see ads displayed on the websites they visit which we think are most relevant to them based on their browsing behaviour and interests. This enhances the user experience while at the same time making our clients’ advertising campaigns more efficient and effective.
We use data analytics to predict user interests based on machine-learning techniques involving the use of algorithms.  Our data scientists regularly review the algorithms that we use in order to ensure they are properly adjusted and error-free. MiQ has approved an “Pixel Implementation” policy which provides, among other things, that we will not target children or vulnerable adults or collect any special categories of personal data about users. MiQ’s “Creative Guidelines” prohibit any discriminatory messages and place restrictions on advertising related to gambling, health & politics.
Consent
MiQ has joined a number of industry schemes including the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (
https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
) and Your Online Ad Choices (
https://www.youronlinechoices.com
) that have been developed to ensure that users are in a position to decide whether and how they want their web browser data used for digital advertising purposes. MiQ’s Vendor Identification number within the transparency and consent framework is 101.
As a result, MiQ will not process personal data unless it can be evidenced that their publisher & advertiser partners have first obtained the users’ permission to do so. This is usually done by means of a pop-up window that enables users to manage their preferences in regard to cookie application and related data processing.
When a user visits a website with which MiQ is associated, they will see a message asking them if they agree to allow the website publisher’s and third-party cookies to be set on their device and collect information from it when they first visit it. If the user agrees to the application of cookies, they will then be asked whether they consent to the processing of the information collected for each of the following purposes:
a) Ad personalisation
The personal data We collect is used to personalise ads that you see over time on other sites. We will use the personal data We collect to infer your interests and place ads that we believe may of interest to you.
b) Ad selection, reporting and delivery
We collect information about what ads were shown, how often and when and where they were shown, whether the user clicked on them and made a purchase. This information is used to measure the effectiveness of the ads presented.
c) Content delivery, selection and reporting
We collect and analyse information about the user’s interests and what content was shown, how often, when and where, and whether the user clicked on what was shown. This is done to adjust the content displayed to the user to be most relevant.
d) Measurement
We collect information on web visitors’ use of content in combination with previously collected information. We use this data to understand and report on their use of content to our advertising clients or for MiQ’s internal quality assurance purposes.
In the process of using data for the above purposes, MiQ also employs the following technical features: i) matching data to offline sources, ii) linking devices and iii) precise geographic location data.
When a user agrees to the placement of cookies by Us and one or more of the identified processing activities, we will receive a message from the website where the visitor’s selection has been made, notifying Us that We have permission to set a cookie, collect information on the user’s device and use it for the agreed purposes. A user may withdraw consent at any time on the websites visited or by changing their preferences on
www.youronlinechoices.eu
. They can do this by finding the reference to MiQ and withdrawing their consent.
MiQ’s legitimate interest in preventing fraudulent website traffic
We also process personal data in order to detect the use of internet “bots” or similar functionality intended to distort the popularity of websites and digital ads by simulating human browsing activity. If a user agrees to the placement of a cookie and accepts the processing of their personal data for one or more of the purposes described above, our ability to detect this type of fraudulent behaviour is important to ensure that the data we rely on to cater to user preferences is not distorted by false inputs. We therefore use a third-party vendor to assess whether the IP addresses that we are processing are associated with fraudulent activity.
MiQ’s legitimate interest in analysing social trends
We also process personal data in order to analyse trends in social media activity. This involves analysing common keywords that appear in public posts made available on the Twitter platform and producing aggregated insights from these to inform our advertisers about current social trends. We may use Twitter handles to identify trends relating to companies and popular personalities.
Should a user wish to object to our processing of their personal data for these purposes, they may do so by contacting our DPO as indicated in Section 2 above.
D – How long do we keep your personal data?
MiQ minimises the personal data it collects about users and retains the data for only limited periods.
Raw data that MiQ collects about user online activities is kept for no longer than 180 days from the date collected and is stored in a secure environment. The user-level data is either anonymised or aggregated after 180 days, which means the information is expressed only in a summary form about user behaviour representing large groups of individuals. Anonymous data may be kept at MiQ for 2 years and aggregated information relating to financial performance stored for up to 7 years for accounting and audit purposes. During the initial 180-day period, the information about user online behaviour is used to better target the ad campaigns and adjust the audience to ensure the ad is displayed to user groups that may be most interested in the product or service advertised. The data collected as part of the ad campaign may be used to develop insight reports for MiQ clients concerning advertising trends and campaign results.  These reports are based on data that is provided in an aggregated form and does not allow for the identification of individuals.

3. Categories and Sources of Personal Data and Purposes and Lawful Basis for Processing
MiQ is a technology company operating in the digital advertising ecosystem. We use data analytics to help our clients (advertisers, media agencies, brands) to advertise their ads on various websites that allow third party advertising, so called ‘publishers’. We develop insights into the browsing behaviour of website users for our clients or for publishers in order to develop targeted digital advertising campaigns for our clients that create a better user experience.
We participate in various industry schemes that are designed to ensure that any user-level personal data we process for these purposes is collected and processed on the basis of the user’s consent.
We also collect and process personal data about visitors to our own website (
https://www.wearemiq.com/
), as well as business contact data relating to the account representatives of our customers and vendors, and visitors to our physical premises.
We may source, use and otherwise process personal data in different ways in regard to each of these data subject categories, as explained in the following sections:
3.1 Visitors to publishers' websites
A – Sources of personal data
B – Personal data that we collect and process
C – Why do we collect your personal data and what are our lawful bases for it?
D – How long do we keep your personal data?
MiQ analyses web browsing usage in order to provide our clients (advertisers and media agencies) with the ability to improve returns on their digital advertising spend by enabling them to serve ads that are relevant to website visitors.We use cookies and similar applications to develop marketing insights about user preferences, sometime in combination with other data sets, in order to better match ad content with user interests.
A – Sources of personal data
The websites that users visit may allow third parties, such as MiQ, to set cookies or similar applications on user devices or browsers when they visit the websites. We collect and analyse the data obtained via these applications. We may combine this data with aggregate data obtained from social media companies and market research firms, and user-level data from other advertising technology companies that support our services in various ways, such as fraud prevention through the detection of “bots.”
B – Personal data that we collect and process
MiQ collects various categories of personal data at the user level, including the following:
IP address, which helps us to understand the broad location of a user
Device ID (when users access websites on mobile devices), such as IDFA, AAID, SHA1
User ID stored in a cookie placed on a user’s browser
Latitude-longitude location data
Timestamp on accessing the website and the website URL
Enrichment data collected about you from third parties, such as Nielsen & Eyeota.
Tweets & Twitter handles, made publicly available via the Twitter platform
User interactions with the ad placed, i.e. we will know if a user clicks on it or the user’s browser & operating system type. Sometimes advertisers may provide us with information on what users have previously purchased from them and when, in order to make our predictions more accurate.
Cookie technology is placed on devices to assist with the ad delivery process. This includes:
1. A user ID cookie to support ad personalisation, which lasts for 90 days
2. An opt-out cookie to store your opt-out and consent preferences, which lasts for 90 days
3. A session cookie to see if a browser supports cookies, which lasts for 1 browsing session
4. A cookie which limits the number of ads which a given user sees, which lasts for 90 days
5. A cookie which denotes whether a user ID is synced with other partners in the ad-serving chain
6. A cookie which supports billing and reporting.

Pixel policy
Pixel Implementation Guidelines
An advertiser or agency implementing pixels including Microsoft (Xandr), Google DV360 and MiQ’s Capture pixel technology on their webpages must adhere to the following guidelines in order to ensure that data is gathered in a safe and compliant manner.
Prohibited Datasets
The following types of data are prohibited from being passed into MiQ pixels:
Personally Identifiable Information
Contact information or any data defined as PII in the USA are prohibited, including:
Names
Postal or email addresses
Phone numbers
Social security numbers
For the avoidance of doubt, online identifiers used for advertising and analytics purposes such as customer IDs, cookie and device Ids, IP addresses and granular location data, all of which may be defined as personal data, are permitted to be passed into MiQ pixels.
Please note
: when implementing a universal pixel on your website(s) all information present in web URLs will be passed into the pixel. As a result please be mindful not to place the pixel on any part of the website where PII, such as an email address used to log in, may be present in the URL.
Sensitive data categories
Any data fields which may reveal the following attributes about a user:
race;
ethnic origin;
politics;
religion;
trade union membership;
genetics;
biometrics (where used for ID purposes);
health;
sex life; or
sexual orientation.
Further information on sensitive data categories can be found on the
ICO
website.
1.3 Vulnerable data subjects
Any data that relates to vulnerable users, for example:
Under 16s
Gambling or drug addicts
The elderly
The mentally ill/unstable
Restricted Datasets
The following data are restricted and may only be passed into a pixel with the prior approval of MiQ following a review from their DPO.
High risk information
Some standard advertising data fields may have high risk implications depending on their context
Accept/reject flags/passbacks for financial products which require a credit check – for example loans, mortgages and credit cards
Conversions for drug and pharmaceutical products
Transparency and Consent
European laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the e-Privacy Directive, create obligations for digital publishers (including advertisers) to give visitors to their sites and apps information about their use and sharing of personal data, as well as about the use of cookies, mobile ad IDs, and other forms of local storage. In many cases these laws also require that consent be obtained.
As a result advertisers that use pixels to attribute digital activity or perform retargeting, regardless of the technology used, are likely to need a transparency and consent solution in place on their site in order to continue using this technology at any meaningful scale. The solution for this which has been developed by the IAB and wider advertising community is the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework. The below are some steps which will enable you to leverage the IAB framework and its benefits:
Setup a CMP on your website
. A CMP is a consent management provider which helps to read and/or set a user’s consent status. A CMP is not necessarily the company that surfaces the user interface to a user (although it can be the same). Go here for a list of IAB registered CMPs and here for more information on Google’s approach to consent management. In addition, MiQ have partnered with Pluto, a user-first CMP also registered with the IAB, which we can assist advertisers to implement, on-request, from May 16th.
Configure the CMP.
The configuration of the CMP and any interface is completely in the control of the website owner. User Interface (Consent Modal) – you can use pre-configured user experiences provided by the CMP, or customise this yourself Vendors – vendors are the 3rd parties which will be presented within the consent modal on your site. You may include any company listed in the IAB’s Global Vendor List here. On MiQ campaigns:
MiQ (vendor 101), Microsoft (Xandr), Google (Doubleclick) and your adserver/floodlight tech (e.g. DCM, Sizmek, Flashtalking) are crucial in order for us to gather and use pixel data
Exchange partners such as Rubicon, Pubmatic, OpenX and MoPub may be useful if you adopt a “global” consent approach (see below)
Any 3rd party trackers which may be added in the creative by you or your agency are also useful to include, for example Nielsen, [m]Platform, Adobe, Oracle Type of consent – the IAB supports 2 main types of consent:
undefinedundefined
Configure your pixels.
Once consent is being gathered, the final step is to re-configure your pixels/floodlights in order to ensure that they only load after consent has been gathered. Your agency and/or adserver/tag manager account manager can support you with this. If you do not use a tag management system or floodlight technology, then we can provide you with revised pixels that will only load on consented users. Please let us know if this is the case and we can assist further.
Regardless of steps 1 and 2, we request that all advertisers make this step-3 change prior to May 25th.

Brand safety policy
Brand safety policy
MiQ is fully committed to providing brands with the maximum level of brand safety. MiQ is an IAB Gold Standard Certified Buyer and is certified by TAG Against Fraud and for Brand Safety.
Specifically, MiQ uses leading independently certified content verification tools and proprietary technology to implement pre and post bid solutions, ensuring maximum brand safety levels and reducing fraud and piracy risk.
Brand safety policies
—
Pre-bid –
1. DSP audited Inventory –
MiQ maintains a strict set of criteria for excluding unacceptable inventory in partnership with operated DSPs. Any inventory that we detect as falling within these criteria will be added to our DSP exclusion lists. Inventory is human audited by the DSP, or by inventory providers. Audits are conducted regularly to ensure validation of new domains or behavior changes to existing domains.
2. Inventory categorization standards –
MiQ excludes by default environments categorized as toolbar, plug-ins or extensions, incentivised clicks and contextual nudity. In keeping with listed best practices MiQ does not serve upon non-audited inventory sources, where categories cannot be determined.
3. Seller inclusion lists –
MiQ enforces a strict inclusion list of exchanges and publishers. Inclusion lists are scored based upon inventory quality and integrity. Inclusion lists have been curated from 8+ years of data and monthly ongoing human and data led audits.
4. Domain exclusion lists –
Domain exclusion lists are rigorously enforced at MiQ, and again by default are excluded from all campaigns. Domain exclusion lists have been created from 8+ years of data mining and human audits, these continue to be refreshed on a weekly cadence. MiQ accommodates advertiser and / or agency exclusion lists – these are updated weekly. This includes but is not limited to GroupM, Publicis, OMD global exclusion lists.
5. 3rd party ad verification –
MiQ have close partnerships with MRC accredited internet services; Xandr, Google, Amazon, Integral Ad Science, Comscore, Digital Envoy, DoubleVerify among others. Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify specifically are used to determine and block pre-bid inventory that is deemed suspicious or consistent with adult, gambling, download, drug, nudity, alcohol, hate speech, offensive language content. Furthermore, sophisticated traffic suspected of botnet traffic or viewability interference is also blocked to provide additional pre-bid blocking parameters. Inventory that is unrateable is blocked, it is understood that inventory that is unrateable may be more liable to non-compliance.
6. Semantic / keyword blocking –
MiQ partners with a range of contextual partners including Integral Ad Science, Comscore and Peer39, to use advanced keyword technology to block and verify contextual attributes. By default, sensitive attributes are blocked. MiQ use Boolean logic to block when either keyword OR ad verification partner deems an impression unsuitable, not in an AND rule i.e. when both match. The combination of keyword and ad verification techniques prevents mismatch, providing a robust understanding of the nature of a page prior to purchase.
7. Log-level integrations –
MiQ have log-level integrations with Integral Ad Science and leading DSPs ingesting raw impression feed data. This data is used to validate inventory delivery at the URL level rather than just the domain level. It also means custom solutions for advertisers and / or agencies can be built seamlessly.
8. IP fraud prevention –
MiQ as well as working with leading 3rd parties in the industry, are again providing a proprietary solution to IP fraud, excluding on average 1-2M+ daily IPs in real-time. This by default is applied to all campaigns. This in its simplest form prevents geo mismatches between ad servers, blocks cloud hosting IPs etc. This prevents fraud that cannot easily be identified via inventory analysis alone, an IP safety layer is therefore critical to ensure maximum brand safety standards.
—
Post-bid –
1. 3rd party ad verification –
Upon bid submission and a winning auction (but before the ad has rendered) the text, images and links of the page are scanned and scored on a level of brand safety. By default, MiQ permit ad rendering to occur only if the content of the page has the maximum level of brand safety and no additional information about the content of the page has any conflict with mandatory pre-bid standards.
2. Daily refinement –
All levels of inventory are vetted on a post-bid nature to improve pre-bid setup. This is a continuous cycle and maintained via data scientists and automated methodology.
Learn –> Refine –> Action –> Learn –> Refine –> Action

Bespoke –
Client best practices –
MiQ can ingest agency and / or advertiser best practices. Seamlessly applying domain, keyword, IP, geo exclusion lists to complement existing MiQ protocol.
—
Takedown Policy –
Should a client want to stop an ad campaign or have any brand safety related queries, MiQ will guarantee activity be paused and queried within 24 hours but will endeavor to do this instantly. Clients should email notice to your account manager or the alias
brandsafety@miqdigital.com
.
The contractual consequences of not taking down an ad in accordance with MiQ‘s Takedown policy are subject to the terms of each individual Insertion Order negotiated with each Buyer.
Anti-Piracy Policies –
MiQ employs a range of measures to prevent appearing alongside inappropriate or pirated content across our programmatic media buying. These range from proprietary MiQ solutions to Content Verification (CV) & Anti-Piracy (AP) tools provided through our partnerships with third party verification vendors.
MiQ mandates that CV & AP tools provided by vendors holding the TAG Brand Safety Certified Seal and the TAG Certified Against Piracy Seal are applied across all applicable activity.
MiQ primary vendors include Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify who both hold the TAG Brand Safety Certified Seal and TAG Certified Against Piracy Seal across their services.
Through these measures, MiQ achieves a brand safety floor across all applicable activity by avoiding content across the eleven sensitive topics in Tier 1 of the IAB Tech Lab Content Taxonomy 3.0:
– Arms & Ammunition
– Crime & Harmful acts to individuals and Society and Human Right Violations
– Death, Injury, or Military Conflict
– Online piracy
– Hate speech & acts of aggression
– Obscenity and Profanity
– Illegal Drugs/Tobacco/eCigarettes/ Vaping/Alcohol
– Spam or Harmful Content
– Terrorism
– Sensitive Social Issues
In addition to this brand safety floor, MiQ works with clients where requested to define a brand suitability profile based on additional categorisation of inventory. This brand suitability profile is then implemented through domain & app inclusion lists, dynamic content filtering & blocking provided by third party verification vendors as well as keyword & semantic targeting or filtering.
MiQ also receives log level data across activity where our IAS monitoring pixel is present which which provides impression level Brand Risk & Piracy analysis. This data is used to supplement decisioning for MiQ’s proprietary pre bid filtering and enhance overall protection.

MiQ excludes by default environments categorized as toolbar, plug-ins or extensions, incentivised clicks and contextual nudity. In keeping with listed best practices MiQ does not serve upon non-audited inventory sources, where categories cannot be determined.
3. Seller inclusion lists –
MiQ enforces a strict inclusion list of exchanges and publishers. Inclusion lists are scored based upon inventory quality and integrity. Inclusion lists have been curated from 8+ years of data and monthly ongoing human and data led audits.
4. Domain exclusion lists –
Domain exclusion lists are rigorously enforced at MiQ, and again by default are excluded from all campaigns. Domain exclusion lists have been created from 8+ years of data mining and human audits, these continue to be refreshed on a weekly cadence. MiQ accommodates advertiser and / or agency exclusion lists – these are updated weekly. This includes but is not limited to GroupM, Publicis, OMD global exclusion lists.
5. 3rd party ad verification –
MiQ have close partnerships with MRC accredited internet services; Xandr, Google, Amazon, Integral Ad Science, Comscore, Digital Envoy, DoubleVerify among others. Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify specifically are used to determine and block pre-bid inventory that is deemed suspicious or consistent with adult, gambling, download, drug, nudity, alcohol, hate speech, offensive language content. Furthermore, sophisticated traffic suspected of botnet traffic or viewability interference is also blocked to provide additional pre-bid blocking parameters. Inventory that is unrateable is blocked, it is understood that inventory that is unrateable may be more liable to non-compliance.
6. Semantic / keyword blocking –
MiQ partners with a range of contextual partners including Integral Ad Science, Comscore and Peer39, to use advanced keyword technology to block and verify contextual attributes. By default, sensitive attributes are blocked. MiQ use Boolean logic to block when either keyword OR ad verification partner deems an impression unsuitable, not in an AND rule i.e. when both match. The combination of keyword and ad verification techniques prevents mismatch, providing a robust understanding of the nature of a page prior to purchase.
7. Log-level integrations –
MiQ have log-level integrations with Integral Ad Science and leading DSPs ingesting raw impression feed data. This data is used to validate inventory delivery at the URL level rather than just the domain level. It also means custom solutions for advertisers and / or agencies can be built seamlessly.
8. IP fraud prevention –
MiQ as well as working with leading 3rd parties in the industry, are again providing a proprietary solution to IP fraud, excluding on average 1-2M+ daily IPs in real-time. This by default is applied to all campaigns. This in its simplest form prevents geo mismatches between ad servers, blocks cloud hosting IPs etc. This prevents fraud that cannot easily be identified via inventory analysis alone, an IP safety layer is therefore critical to ensure maximum brand safety standards.
—
Post-bid –
1. 3rd party ad verification –
Upon bid submission and a winning auction (but before the ad has rendered) the text, images and links of the page are scanned and scored on a level of brand safety. By default, MiQ permit ad rendering to occur only if the content of the page has the maximum level of brand safety and no additional information about the content of the page has any conflict with mandatory pre-bid standards.
2. Daily refinement –
All levels of inventory are vetted on a post-bid nature to improve pre-bid setup. This is a continuous cycle and maintained via data scientists and automated methodology.
Learn –> Refine –> Action –> Learn –> Refine –> Action
—
Bespoke –
Client best practices –
MiQ can ingest agency and / or advertiser best practices. Seamlessly applying domain, keyword, IP, geo exclusion lists to complement existing MiQ protocol.
—
Takedown Policy –
Should a client want to stop an ad campaign or have any brand safety related queries, MiQ will guarantee activity be paused and queried within 24 hours but will endeavor to do this instantly. Clients should email notice to your account manager or the alias
brandsafety@miqdigital.com
.
The contractual consequences of not taking down an ad in accordance with MiQ‘s Takedown policy are subject to the terms of each individual Insertion Order negotiated with each Buyer.
Anti-Piracy Policies –
MiQ employs a range of measures to prevent appearing alongside inappropriate or pirated content across our programmatic media buying. These range from proprietary MiQ solutions to Content Verification (CV) & Anti-Piracy (AP) tools provided through our partnerships with third party verification vendors.
MiQ mandates that CV & AP tools provided by vendors holding the TAG Brand Safety Certified Seal and the TAG Certified Against Piracy Seal are applied across all applicable activity.
MiQ primary vendors include Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify who both hold the TAG Brand Safety Certified Seal and TAG Certified Against Piracy Seal across their services.
Through these measures, MiQ achieves a brand safety floor across all applicable activity by avoiding content across the eleven sensitive topics in Tier 1 of the IAB Tech Lab Content Taxonomy 3.0:
– Arms & Ammunition
– Crime & Harmful acts to individuals and Society and Human Right Violations
– Death, Injury, or Military Conflict
– Online piracy
– Hate speech & acts of aggression
– Obscenity and Profanity
– Illegal Drugs/Tobacco/eCigarettes/ Vaping/Alcohol
– Spam or Harmful Content
– Terrorism
– Sensitive Social Issues
In addition to this brand safety floor, MiQ works with clients where requested to define a brand suitability profile based on additional categorisation of inventory. This brand suitability profile is then implemented through domain & app inclusion lists, dynamic content filtering & blocking provided by third party verification vendors as well as keyword & semantic targeting or filtering.
MiQ also receives log level data across activity where our IAS monitoring pixel is present which which provides impression level Brand Risk & Piracy analysis. This data is used to supplement decisioning for MiQ’s proprietary pre bid filtering and enhance overall protection.

Modern slavery statement
MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT FOR MiQ DIGITAL LIMITED
(“THE COMPANY”)
Download this document
here
.
This Statement sets out the measures that MIQ Digital Limited, The Company, has taken and continues to take to ensure that modern slavery and/or human trafficking does not take place within our business, our clients, or our supply chain. The Company commits to supporting and respecting the
UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights
, the
10 Principles of the UN Global Compact
, and other internationally proclaimed human rights standards, across the organisation. This includes section 54(1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the Company’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2022.  It was approved by the Company’s board of directors on 31 August 2023.
Our Commitment
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. The Company is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships. We continue to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
Our Business
The Company is an international marketing intelligence company.  We employ over 1,000 people in 9 countries located in North America, Europe, Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region and predominantly staffed by highly skilled employees. This statement applies to, and covers all, of the Company’s subsidiaries and any other company within its corporate group. Our key supply chains comprise of:
Digital advertising marketplaces/demand side platforms (DSPs);
Data suppliers;
Other IT and technical service companies;
Other companies supplying services connected to the serving, monitoring and verification of on-line advertisements.
We consider that the sector that we operate in, the transactions that we undertake and any business relationships that we enter into all carry a low risk in terms of slavery and human trafficking.
Our Approach
The Company will remain alert to risk from any form of modern slavery including, but not limited to, child labour, slavery, human trafficking, exploitation, workplace safety and relevant labour laws.  If the Company has any reason to suspect that any of its suppliers are affected by slavery or human trafficking, it will carry out reasonable and appropriate investigations and take necessary action. We are committed to acting ethically, responsibility, socially and with integrity in all our business relationships. We ensure that there are effective controls in place to identify and safeguard our business from any form of modern slavery in our business, clients, or supply chain.
We adhere to several Company-wide policies and procedures to ensure that we conduct our business in an ethical and transparent way. This is a broader commitment to conducting business the right way.
Right to work:
we operate a robust process to ensure that right to work eligibility is carried out to safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will;
Global Policies:
MiQ has policies for each region relating to Whistleblowing and Anti-Bribery and Corruption.
Vault Whistleblowing:
Introduction of a third party reporting system – Vault – where individuals can raise concerns (anonymously if they wish) about how colleagues and prospective colleagues are treated, and report any suspicious practices within our business, clients, or supply chain, without fear of reprisal.
Our Suppliers and Customers
We have a zero tolerance approach to dealing, or supporting, any business in our supply chain and from customers knowingly involved in slavery or human trafficking. We expect all companies with which we work with are committed to, and have respect for, the protection and preservation of internationally recognised human rights. In 2022 we had a formal third party and vendor management program in place which included:
Account management meetings;
Legal review;
Third party risk register and risk management.
Our Performance Indicators
We continuously monitor the effectiveness of the steps that we are taking to ensure that modern slavery and/or human trafficking does not take place anywhere within our business, customers, and supply chain.
We will review the risk from modern slavery and human trafficking annually and assess whether the risk has increased.  If so, then we will consider what further actions are required to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains.

Users:
You are a User when you visit a page of a website or application of one of Outbrain’s partners where the Outbrain widget is installed or our recommendations are placed (“Partner Sites”). For example, if you visit
https://news.sky.com/uk
,
www.spiegel.de
or
www.cnn.com
, the Outbrain widget is implemented on those websites. You know you are engaging with an Outbrain widget when you see text referencing Outbrain (e.g., “Recommended by Outbrain”, “by Outbrain” near recommendations If you click on the hyperlinked reference to Outbrain you will see a
detailed notice
that enables you to navigate to
Outbrain’s Interest Portal
and this Privacy Policy where you can opt out of personalized recommendations. In some instances, a partner may have white-label Outbrain’s service for their own offering. In such an event, such partners must disclose their use of Outbrain in their privacy policies.
Example of an Outbrain Widget

.
(a) What information we collect and why
We use UUIDs, IP Address and other Usage Information so that we can serve interesting recommendations. Outbrain’s recommendations may be paid for by an advertiser linking you to a new website or they may be organic such that the link is to another page on the same Partner’s Site. Outbrain may use high-level health interest categories to serve recommendations, that you can find
here
.
UUID
When you, as a User, first visit a Partner Site (e.g., CNN.com), Outbrain drops a cookie on your device in order to generate a UUID. Alternatively, if you first interact with a Partner using that Partner’s application, Outbrain receives your advertiser ID which is assigned to you by your device. We catalogue and analyze the content you consume across Partner Sites. Our recommendations are based on: (i) a UUIDs browsing history; (ii) similar browsing patterns of other Users; (iii) recommendations that are generally popular with Outbrain’s audience at this time; (iv) some randomness, and (v) targeting requirements that may be provided or requested by our Amplify clients. As an example, Outbrain may know that UUID 123 (which could be you on your iPhone X on The Guardian using Chrome as your browser) likes to read about far away holiday destinations and that people who like to read about far away holiday destinations also like to read about exotic food. When you interact with Outbrain we do not collect traditional personal data from you, like your email address or name, therefore we cannot associate your name with your UUID (for example, we do not know that John Smith, who is also UUID 123, likes to read about far away holiday destinations).
The UUID is a sequence of numbers and/or letters. This UUID attaches itself to your device and varies depending on your browser combination. In other words, Outbrain records a different UUID depending on which device and/or which browser you use when accessing the Partner Sites. For example, you will have one UUID when you visit a Partner Site from your mobile phone using the browser Safari, and a different UUID when you visit a Partner Site from your iPad using the browser Safari. Outbrain will combine and consolidate a UUID from a mobile device (handheld or tablet) from a browser that then accesses an application (or vice versa) from that same device. Outbrain does not conduct cross device tracking and therefore cannot link a user interacting with Outbrain on their phone as the same user who is interacting with Outbrain on their desktop.
IP Address
In addition to your UUID, we recognise your IP address, which we translate into geolocation and delete the last octet in order to mask the identifying information. We then use this masked information, in conjunction with information we received from other trusted third party partners (such as MaxMind) to determine a broad understanding of where you are located (e.g., New York). Outbrain will still recognise your IP address even if you opt out of personalised tracking as this is necessary to continue serving you context-based recommendations however, in such instances your IP address is not associated with your UUID and would not form part of any user profile.
Other Usage Information
In addition to your UUID and IP address, we also collect the following information from you on (a) desktop and mobile web: (i) User Agent data: device type (e.g., iPhone), browser type (e.g., chrome), operating system (e.g. iOS); (ii) the pages visited; (iii) the time of visit; and (iv) referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests. The above statistical information provides us with information about how many Users visited a specific page on our Partner Sites on which the Outbrain widget is installed, how long each User stayed on that page, the type of content on that page they clicked on and how they generally engaged with that page; and (b) on applications (i) application version (as it appears in App Store or Play Store); (ii) application ID or package name (as it appears in the App Store or Play Store); (iii) operating system ( e.g. IOS or Android); (iii) operating system version; and (iv) device model (e.g. iPhone X).This information is considered personal data if Outbrain associates it with a UUID.
As Outbrain does not have a direct relationship with Users interacting with Partner Sites, Outbrain relies on its partners to determine the lawful basis upon which Outbrain can process personal data. Each partner site relies on either

under “Users” for a detailed list of the First Party Cookies we use when you interact with Partner Sites where the Outbrain technology is implemented.
Outbrain pixels
In addition to Outbrain’s visible widget on Partner Sites, certain Outbrain advertisers may implement the Outbrain pixel on their websites. The Outbrain pixel determines whether the User reaching the page where the pixel is installed has an Outbrain UUID in order to provide reporting to advertisers in respect of their particular campaign. If there is a UUID associated with such end user, Outbrain allows advertisers to either retarget those UUIDs and/or provides advertisers with the total number of Users (on an aggregated and anonymised basis) that reached a particular page (for example, an advertiser does not know that UUID1234 converted but only that 1 conversion took place). Outbrain does not pass its advertisers any personal data (including your UUID) or collect any further personal data via the pixel. Outbrain does not combine information received from the Outbrain pixel information with a UUID’s profile (for example, Outbrain only tracks that 1 conversion has taken place and not the UUID123 has converted when it reaches the advertiser’s chosen page). We require advertisers to disclose the usage of the Outbrain pixel on their own websites.Outbrain may also allow certain trusted third party partners to collect data via cookies delivered through the Outbrain widget. In such cases, Outbrain does not pass these third parties the data which Outbrain collects on its Users but allows such third parties to directly collect data (including personal data) via the widget for fraud and/or security purposes or in order to provide measurement information to advertisers (such as the number of conversions and/or impressions). Any such collection shall be governed by such third parties privacy policy.
Third party pixels
If you click on a link to one of our recommendations, the advertiser sponsoring the recommendation may place cookies (or third party cookies of third parties acting on the advertiser’s behalf) on your device either through redirects prior to arriving on the destination page of the recommendations or upon reaching the destination page. Such cookies are dropped for the purposes of providing analytics to the advertiser with regards to the advertiser’s campaign (for example, to see how many users viewed the advertiser’s campaign). We require our advertisers to disclose the use of third party pixels and/or cookies to end users via their website. As these cookies and/or pixels are added at the sole discretion of our advertisers you will be subject to that advertiser’s privacy notice and/or privacy policy.
Third Party Segments
Outbrain’s policy restricts targeting based on sensitive demographics like political views due to privacy concerns and the potential for bias. However, based on Outbrain’s third-party targeting options available to our advertisers, Outbrain may use third-party standard politics related segments
t
hat may indicate general political sentiment, interest in specific political issues, and political party affiliation. Outbrain does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, Personal Data revealing your racial or ethnic origin or your religious affiliations, or Personal Data concerning your sensitive health information, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data).
(c) How we may share information
Our Partners
Outbrain does not share and/or sell a User’s entire profiles with any third parties. However, we may share certain elements of a user profile (for example, UUID) with the following partners, including:
Brand safety, analytics and fraud partners;
Demand Side Platforms (DSP) and Supply Side Platforms (SSP);
Ad Exchanges and/or Networks; and
Demand Management Platforms.
Please see
here
for a list of some of our trusted partners. In addition, we may collect and/ or share some personal data with trusted partners by virtue of participating in the OpenRTB. Many of these partners are registered as IAB TCF Global Vendors and can be found
here
.
(d) Your rights
Outbrain opt out on desktop and mobile web
You may opt out of Outbrain’s personalized recommendations (or, if you have opted out and would like to opt back in) at any time by moving the toggle below. You may also opt out of personalized recommendations via Outbrain’s
Interest Profile
which is a website that provides a general visualization of the data Outbrain knows about you and may use to make its recommendations.
Outbrain opt out on apps
In order to opt-out of Outbrain’s recommendations on your mobile applications you can follow the steps below:
iOS Devices: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking
Android Devices: Google Settings App > Ads > Opt Out of Interest-based Advertising
Please note that an opt out via our Interest Profile and/or this Privacy Policy will not opt you out of personalised tracking on your applications. This opt out must be done via your device settings.
Additional Opt-Out Options
You may also opt out of receiving personalized ads served by us or other advertising companies through industry powered tools such as the NAI or the various DAA-based pages (DAA,
http://www.aboutads.info/choices
; DAAC,
www.youradchoices.ca/choices
, and/or EDAA
www.youronlinechoices.eu
). Visiting the NAI, DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages allows you to opt out of all some or all of the participating members’ services. Like Outbrain’s opt out, these opt outs do not mean you will no longer receive any advertising, the advertisements will just not be tailored to you. You will continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e.,
contextually based ads
). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective as our opt out is cookie based.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Even though you have opted out of Outbrain’s personalised recommendations:
You will still see Outbrain recommendations.
Opting out of Outbrain personalization tracking does not mean you will no longer receive recommendations from Outbrain. Instead, it means that Outbrain’s recommendations will not be personalized (i.e. they will be context based recommendations).
Your opt out will be cookie based and device/browser specific.
If you browse the web from several devices and/or browsers, you will need to opt out from each device and/or browser to ensure that we prevent personalization tracking on all of them. For the same reason, if you buy a new device, change browsers or delete (or clear) the opt out cookie, you will need to opt-out again. Opting out of personalization tracking is not the same as blocking cookies.
You must not opt in to Outbrain for at least 21 days as the deletion of your profile is tied to your UUID
.
Your opt out from Outbrain’s personalized recommendations is effective immediately. However, if your browser permits local storage and you opt into Outbrain’s personalized recommendations (for example, by accepting a cookie banner) within 21 days of your opt out, it is possible your prior profile will be reconnected to your UUID. If you do not opt in within 21 days, your profile will be deleted and cannot be recovered.
As with most opt out cookies, the Outbrain browser opt out relies upon a cookie.
The opt-out cookie is intended to be persistent to honor the user’s preferences. However, the “Intelligent Tracking Prevention” feature in iOS11 may impact the persistence of cookies across websites post a 24 hour window. We suggest using another browser or considering blocking all 3rd party cookies from the browser so that you are “opted out” without needing to rely on any company’s actual opt out methodology.
Your local storage will not be cleared.
Even though you have opted out of Outbrain’s personalised recommendations your local storage will not be automatically cleared and therefore you need to clear this at a browser level in addition to your opt out.
Business Partners:
You are a Business Partner when you register (or email with Outbrain) on behalf of the company you work for to use the Outbrain Amplify or Outbrain Engage Services.
See more here
.
(a) What information we collect and why
You may provide certain personal data (such as email address) when you sign up for the Amplify or Engage services or otherwise communicate or interact with us. If you apply to become a Business Partner, we may request additional information from you via advertiser application forms, insertion orders and other forms. We automatically collect information about your username’s actions in the Outbrain dashboard. As an example, as an Amplify Business Partner if you change the cost-per-click for one your campaigns, Outbrain’s audit trail will have a record of all those actions.
We collect and process the personal data above in order to perform our obligations under our agreement as a Business Partner (or prospective Business Partner) with you including to:
respond to your questions and requests;
to provide you with access to certain functions and features of our Amplify or Engage services (e.g., to provide and maintain your dashboard account);
verify your identity; and
communicate with you about your account, our products, and available promotions relevant to your use of the Amplify or Engage service.
(b) What cookies and other similar technologies we use
Please see this
Cookie Table
under “Business Partners” for a detailed list of First and Third Party cookies (and their corresponding retention periods) we use with Business Partners.
(c) How we may share information with anyone
We may disclose certain Business Partner information to vendors, contractors, or others who assist Outbrain in delivering the services (e.g., credit card processing). Also see the
Sharing
section of this Privacy Policy.
(d) Your rights
If as a Business Partner you wish to verify, correct, update or request the deactivation of your information, you may go to the Outbrain dashboard in order to edit your profile preferences or contact us at
support@outbrain.com
. If you are receiving Outbrain emails, you may “unsubscribe” using a link in the email. Note that unsubscribing shall not opt you out of notifications critical to providing the Amplify or Engage services (e.g., email invoices).
(e) Lawful Basis
Outbrain’s lawful basis for processing personal data of Business Partners is contractual.
4. Security Measures, Transfers Outside the EEA, Sharing and Data Retention
Security
Outbrain has a dedicated security team. We maintain tight controls over the personal data we collect, retaining it in firewalled and secured databases with strictly limited and controlled access rights, to ensure it is secure. Please see our
security standards
for more information.
Business Partners have access to certain password-protected features of the Amplify or Engage service. Business Partners are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for ensuring the same for their employees and/or their agents. Please remember that, unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is never completely secure. A common Internet scam is known as “spoofing” or “phishing.” This occurs when you receive an email from what appears to be a legitimate source requesting personal data from you. Please be aware that we will not send you any emails requesting you to verify credit card, bank information, or any other personal data. If you ever receive an email that appears to be from us requesting such information from you, do not respond to it, and do not click on any links appearing in the email. Instead, please forward the email to us at
legal@outbrain.com
, as we will investigate instances of possible Internet fraud.
Data Transfers Outside the EU/EEA
When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) we will ensure such transfers are in compliance with relevant data protection laws, including, if applicable, EU Standard Contractual Clauses, or a European Commission positive adequacy decision under Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC or Article 45 of the GDPR. In other words, your rights and protections remain with your data and we used approved contractual clauses and other measures designed to ensure that the recipients of your personal data protect it. Outbrain has in place the Standard Contractual Clauses between Outbrain entities to govern the transfer of data outside of the EEA.
Sharing
In addition to the description of how we may disclose your personal data for each user type, we may also disclose personal data as follows:
Within the family of companies controlled by Outbrain for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes;
If we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal data will likely be among the assets transferred;
When legally required to do so (e.g., to cooperate with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings); and/or
To respond to a genuine emergency.
In addition, we combine your personal data with those of other users in order to share trend information and aggregate user statistics with third parties, always in aggregated and anonymized form.
Data Retention
The retention period for each of the cookies Outbrain uses (whether our own or on our behalf by third parties) is stated in the
Cookie Table
. More specifically, the Outbrain cookie (Obuid),which is used for tracking user actions such as clicks, expires three (3) months after a user visited a particular site within our network however, this cookie will reset if a user returns to the same site or different site within our network. In addition, we do not retain any individual data point on a User for more than 13 months. For example, if UUID 123 read an article on December 31, 2018, on February 1, 2019 that article will no longer be part of UUID 123’s profile. Outbrain also maintains a Data Retention Policy that details the retention period for personal data based on our analysis of how long the specific data is reasonably required for legal or business purposes. When we no longer need personal data, we securely delete or destroy it. Aggregated data, which cannot identify a device/browser (or individual) and is used for purposes of reporting and analysis, is maintained for as long as commercially necessary.
5. Children and Sensitive Data
Children
None of our services are intentionally directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 16 years of age. If we determine upon collection that a Site Visitor, a User or a Business Partner is under 16, we will not use or maintain his/her personal data. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal data from a child under the age of 16, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records. If you’re a kid, please go play in the yard, don’t use or interact with Outbrain!
Sensitive data
We do not collect or receive any sensitive categories of personal data.

We will continue to monitor industry activity in this area and reassess our DNT practices as necessary. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving personalized recommendations in the Users section.
9. EU-US Data Protection Framework (DPF) Participation
