Data Collection and Processing
Types of Data Collected
Technical Information
While using Our Service We may ask You to provide Us with some necessary technical information. Technical information may include, but is not limited to: IP-address, Your country, Usage Data, device language, device internet speed, and device information number from Your device so that the Services can be provided to You. This collected information is required for Popappa to verify that Your device is accurately registered.
Other data
Popappa accesses and processes phone numbers of, and duration of, incoming and outgoing calls and contact lists with Your explicit consent, to be able to provide You with Our caller ID service. Popappa also accesses and makes use of the Advertising Identifier (Advertiser ID) connected to the installed app and may access and use the documentation on Your consent within Your Google Account setting regarding personalized advertisements. Documentation on this consent only entails a unique ID, which is generated when You install the mobile application and make Your choice.
Furthermore, when You use Our Service, Our Data Partners may, only with Your explicit consent, collect certain device and location data (both approximate and precise location) to be able to offer a range of services that include, but are not limited to, a more customized ad experience, and improved app functionality and user experience through analytics. You can withdraw Your consent at any time.
For end-users of an application with Our Services integrated
If You have installed an application on Your device which has Our service integrated, We may ask Your app provider to provide Us access to some necessary technical information. Technical information may include but is not limited to: device information number from Your device so that the Services can be provided to You. This collected information is required for Popappa to verify that the device of the User (= You) is accurately registered.
Similarly, Popappa also accesses and makes use of the advertiser ID and the documentation on Your consent within Your Google Account setting regarding personalized advertisements. Documentation on Your consent only entails a unique ID, which is generated when You install the mobile application and you can make Your choice regarding advertisements and deny any personalization of ads from the App settings. Popappa cannot trace advertiser IDs, or the unique ID related to a consent back to the identity of a specific user.
Use of Your Data
Popappa commits itself to the terms of the Google Play
Developer Program Policies
and reserves the right to use anonymous data for statistics and user support without restrictions regarding applicability in time.
Popappa may use Your Data for the following purposes:
To provide and maintain Our Service,
including monitoring the usage of Our Service for the purpose of improving the technical functionalities.
To contact You:
To contact You through electronic communications, such as push notifications.
To manage Your requests:
To attend to, and manage a request from You on the deletion of the App and all Your personal data.
We may share Your Data in the following situations:
With business partners (Data Partners):
We may – with Your consent – share Your information with Our business partners. Our business partners may merge the collected data elements to offer You certain services when You click on ads delivered via Our Services in accordance with their stated purposes in their respective privacy policies.
Retention of Your Data
Popappa will process and retain anonymized Usage Data for analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.
Legal Basis for the Processing of Your Data
Popappa processes personal data to pursue Our legitimate interest in managing Our business – including being able to handle contracts and purchases of various products and licenses for Our business and to improve, develop and market Our Services, and comply with Our legal obligations. The legal basis for Our processing is thus the following articles in the general data protection regulation:
Article 6 (1), litra a, according to which personal data may be processed with express consent.
Article 6 (1), litra b, according to which personal data may be processed if this is necessary to fulfill a contract.
Article 6 (1), litra c, according to which personal data may be processed if this is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.
Article 6 (1), litra f, according to which personal data may be processed if this is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest unless the interests of the data subject precede this.
Note:
Because We process Your data partly on basis of Article 6 (1) litra f, (legitimate interests) You may in certain cases object to Our otherwise lawful processing of Your personal data if You find that Your interests in not having Your data processed exceeds Our legitimate interests in processing Your data, cf. article 21 in the general data protection regulation. See further below on Your rights under the data protection regulation.
Transfer of Your Data
Your Personal Data (the advertiser ID and unique ID regarding consent), may be processed in any place where Our Data Partners are located. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — servers located outside of Your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of Your jurisdiction.
If Your data is transferred to a country outside the EU/EEA, and if the country in question has not been approved by the European Commission as providing adequate protection (
See list of adequacy decisions here
) Our data transfers will be based on
Standard Contractual Clauses
(SCC) also approved by the European Commission.
Furthermore, Popappa will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.
We have agreements with the following Data Partners. These third-party vendors collect, store, use, process, and transfer information about Your activity on Our Service in accordance with their own Privacy Policies. We are currently partnered with the following Data Partners who all act as independent Data Controllers to whom Your data will be transferred:

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

Thank you for installing our app.
Data Privacy Policy
The umlaut insightCoreSDK is provided by umlaut communications GmbH, Am Kraftversorgungsturm 3, 52070 Aachen, Germany (“umlaut communications”). Any use of the corresponding host application, where the umlaut insightCoreSDK is part of, is only allowed under the conditions as outlined below.
Declaration of Consent to Data Processing
By downloading and using a host application, which is enabled by the umlaut insightCoreSDK, you are consenting to the data processing as described in this Data Privacy Policy.
With using the umlaut insightCoreSDK, we collect personal-related (pseudonymous) data. This is information that is not directly associated with the real-life identity of the user, for example, the type of internet connection, the measured velocity and location and measurements from connectivity tests, as well as system and usage parameters, and, provide those anonymized to our partners. In NO case do we collect content information such as messages or passwords.
Data Privacy – What we stand for
umlaut communications are aware that you consider a particularly safe handling of all your personal data as extremely important. Therefore, we guarantee that all your data is processed by us in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU legislation, as implemented in Germany.
What information is collected
The umlaut insightCoreSDK collects personal-related (pseudonymous) data. This is information that is not directly associated with the real-life identity of the user (and which could not be used to identify them individually), for example, the type of internet connection, the measured velocity and location and measurements from connectivity tests, as well as system and usage parameters.
At the latest after six months, the pseudonym is automatically replaced by a new random number. Information collected will at NO time be associated with names, email addresses or phone numbers of users. In NO case do we collect content information such as messages or passwords.
In addition to the results of the tests run by the SDK other localization information and technical (system) parameters are obtained. Some technical parameters (such as wireless network information) are collected periodically, e.g. subject to GPS localization events.
As far as IP-addresses are concerned, those will be masked on collection within the app, by removing the last three digits; therefore, a correlation to a single user is no longer possible.
Specifically, the following data will be collected from the user’s device and analyzed:
Measurement results as executed by the umlaut insightCoreSDK (active measurements “Connection Test”)
Internet availability / success ratio
Download time
Latency (“ping”)
Measurement data collected through use of the device (passive measurements)
Download speed
Upload speed
Dropped calls
Wireless access technology
Coverage / signal strength
System and usage parameters
User ID (pseudonymous random number)
Wireless network information (e. g. network operator, Cell ID, signal strength, SSID)
Device information (e. g. model, operating system)
Location information (e. g. longitude / latitude)
Usage information (e. g. transferred amount of data, call logs)
App usage (e. g. of all installed apps, their usage time, duration, volume and location)
Time information (e. g. time stamps of the measurements)
Other system information (e. g. battery status, memory usage, connected devices)
Release information (e. g. app build, data formats)
The regular execution of the connection test and the collection of the passive measurements and system and usage information take place in the background. The connection test is regularly checking the availability of a data network connectivity to the internet and, thereby, it consumes less than 3MB in total per month.
Purpose of Data Collection
The data collected is used statistically, with the purposes of supporting the development and improvement of communication networks as well as usage-related analyses.
Transfer of Information
With acceptance of the Data Privacy Policy, you agree that the information described above, is stored and can be transferred anonymously to our partners.
Personally identifiable data (like name, phone number or email address) are NOT collected and, therefore, can at no time be transferred to third parties. The collected pseudonymous data are only transferred in context of their analyses to our partner umlaut communications.
Lawfulness of data processing is your consent according to Art. 6 (1) a) of GDPR.
Right of the Data Subject
You have the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, notification obligation regarding rectification, erasure, and restriction of processing, data portability and objection.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
To do so, please contact us free of charge. You can also contact our Data Privacy Officer at the e-mail address ins.datenschutz@umlaut.com. Please provide your User ID in the e-mail.
Opt-out
You always have the option to uninstall the application. With the application being uninstalled, the collection of information is stopped immediately and respective data is erased from your device.

By using the umlaut insightCoreSDK, you will not acquire any copyright or intellectual property rights in our services or the content, logos and graphics that you access, which means you cannot use them without our explicit consent.
The umlaut insightCoreSDK is provided to you free of any charge made by us. The umlaut insightCoreSDK will transmit data and this transmitted data may, however, incur costs or be deducted from your data allowance depending on your service contract, and you remain responsible for any such charges to from your service provider. We try to keep this data volume as small as reasonably possible.
Liability
umlaut communications do not warrant that the transferred information is accurate and complete. Except as provided by law, we are not liable should you incur damage from improper, incomplete or delayed transmission of information or a fault of the umlaut insightCoreSDK. If the umlaut insightCoreSDK or the transmission of data leads to interference or damage to hardware or software, we are responsible only to the extent caused by intent or gross negligence by us. We are not liable for any data loss, and you are advised (as you would be when installing and using any app) to ensure you have appropriate backup of the data stored on your device.
Although we always do our best to keep the umlaut insightCoreSDK free of viruses, we do not guarantee that it is virus-free. Again, as with any app you may download and use, you are advised to take care of your own protection and ensure you take appropriate security measures to prevent viruses.
You are not entitled to a continuous and uninterrupted availability of the umlaut insightCoreSDK. However, we endeavor to achieve the highest possible availability and troubleshoot as quickly as possible. In addition, we have the right to temporarily or permanently discontinue our service, even without notice to you individually.
In accordance with the Product Liability Law, nothing in these terms seeks to limit or exclude liability in relation to death or personal injury.
Final Provisions
German law applies to the exclusion of the UN purchase law.
umlaut communications reserves the right to update this Data Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

OUTLOGIC PRIVACY NOTICE
*Please click
HERE
to opt-out of selling your data.
OUTLOGIC LLC a Virginia company (“OUTLOGIC” “we,” “us,” and “our”), provides data services to other companies and organizations, as further described in this privacy notice (“Privacy Notice.”).
This Privacy Notice explains how we collects, uses, stores, and shares personal information about individuals in two different contexts (we refer to such individuals as “you,” “your,” and “yourself”): (1) visitors to our website located at
www.outlogic.io
or (2) when we collect personal information from third parties such as mobile applications (“Apps”). This Privacy Notice also explains certain choices you may have regarding how we use this information about you, as well as rights you may have to access or correct the information we hold and use.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and would like to review your rights under the GDPR, please go to
Section 8
of this Privacy Notice. If you are a resident of California or Virginia or certain other states that have enacted privacy-specific consumer laws, you may review your data privacy rights under those types of state laws at
Section 10
of this Privacy Notice.
Please note that we do not use any precise location data to create or build consumer profiles or targeted audiences in connection with sensitive health based locations, nor do we permit our customers to do so. In addition, to further comply with specific state laws, we use commercially available information to assist in filtering out precise location data for sensitive health based locations in those states.
Below, we explain certain terms that we will use in this Notice that may make it easier to understand:
Advertising ID
: A unique alphanumeric string randomly assigned by operating system manufacturers to a Device. Examples of this include iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs.
Data Aggregators
: Third party data companies that provide data to Outlogic, including personal data and information.
Devices
: Internet-connected mobile devices such as Apple iPhones that use iOS or Samsung Galaxy devices that use Google’s Android OS.
IP Address
: a numeric address in a format that follows the Internet Protocol data rules and that is used to identify a computer, mobile phone, or other device connected to the internet.
Personal Information
: This Policy refers to “Personal Information” and “Personal Data” interchangeably, to mean the types of information/data that applicable laws that use those terms refer to. It includes, for instance, device identifiers, precise location data, name/address, email address, and other unique identifiers that can be associated with them.
Publishers:
Providers of Apps used by Users on Devices.
SDK, or Software Development Kit
: An SDK is a block of computer code that Publishers can integrate with their Apps to collect data, often useful (as in OUTLOGIC’s case) to the mobile advertising and data industries.
Services
: OUTLOGIC’s Services refer to the products and insights we create/provide using location data,
and using and providing IP Addresses
and/or Advertising IDs assigned by Device manufacturers, to companies for marketing and research purposes, for example, to enable their research and personalized advertising. The Services also refer to products and insights we provide using location data and/or Installation IDs assigned to Devices by certain Apps, to companies for research purposes, excluding marketing and personalized advertising. The Services also include the SDK and other similar technologies we may use to collect information.
Site
: Our website that you may visit at
http://www.outlogic.io/
.
Visitors
: Individuals who
visit our website or
choose to provide information directly to us via the OUTLOGIC website “Contact Us” form.
Server to Server App / Server to Server Partner
: OUTLOGIC sometimes partners with certain Publishers or other Data Aggregators, who (in each case) do not use the SDK in favor of sending us information they collect from their Apps using their own SDKs. In other cases, we may obtain the same kinds of information using server-to-server transfers instead of collecting information through SDKs.
System Location Services
: Device technologies that allow Apps to access information about your location (such as GPS coordinates).
Installation ID
: A unique alphanumeric string randomly assigned by certain Apps to a Device but which is not used for advertising purposes.
App Tracking Transparency/Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads
: Features on iOS or Android Devices that allow Users to disable, or limit Apps’ ability to access, the Device Advertising ID. On iOS phones, users who do not give Apps permission to track zeroes out the Advertising ID. On Android phones running Android 12 or newer, users whom Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads zeroes out the Advertising ID.
A. Summary: Who is OUTLOGIC?
OUTLOGIC is a platform for collecting, aggregating, licensing and managing data. In particular, we focus on the curation and use of high-quality location data to help provide insights to organizations of various kinds regarding patterns of peoples’ movements. Our platform assists a variety of businesses and organizations in understanding movement patterns and trends for purposes including marketing and advertising, financial research, market research, traffic and urban planning, smart cities, or educational purposes. Certain government entities or public health organizations may also use our platform, including for purposes of public health research and planning, information security, physical security, to prevent crime, or for civic and traffic planning. (Our specific data licensing practices may vary depending on geographic region).
2. What Types of Information Do We Collect?
A. Information We Collect Through Our Services
We collect information using our SDK. This information may include Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, location information (described more fully below), and other information pertaining to the way Devices and their users engage with mobile advertising services. We also collect the same types of information using Server to Server transfers. We also collect information (including location information) from Publishers to assist them in meeting revenue goals for their Apps, allowing them to provide media, games, and other mobile apps, such as weather or traffic apps, without charging their users. We also may collect and use information from Apps owned by OUTLOGIC affiliated companies.
Publishers can use our SDK with their Apps in order to enhance advertisers’ ability to show ads in Publisher Apps (including to target more relevant ads and to measure ad performance). App Publishers may also work with us to monetize their App content in other ways we describe in this Privacy Policy. (If you would like to opt-out of our use of the Advertising ID on your Device for these purposes, please take the steps explained in
Section 6
below, entitled “User Choices and Opt-Out Tools”).
When you use an App or OUTLOGIC App on your Device that has integrated with our Services (including the SDK), we can collect certain information through or about your Device, if you have granted access to (and you have not later opted-out of our use of) location services and an Advertising ID or Installation ID. In particular (but not exclusively):
Precise Location Information
:
Specific geolocation of the Device, usually described by latitude-longitude coordinates compiled through GPS features of our SDK, WiFi connection information, cell tower triangulation and other methods.
Dwell time within or in proximity to points of interest (i.e. the length of time your device stayed at one place).
Relative Location Information
:
Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) sensors, or beacons,
Information obtained from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Near-field Communication (NFC)
Our SDK is capable of receiving signals from each of the above technologies that indicate the proximity of a Device. For example, certain brick-and-mortar stores use beacons that sense when a Bluetooth-enabled Device is in proximity to the beacon (i.e., when a Device user enters the store). Retail locations, sports arenas, restaurants, museums and other similar businesses may also use beacons.
Advertising IDs or Installation IDs
Timestamps
(that may include time and date)
Device Event Information
:
App or system crashes
System crashes
Device settings
Device Usage Information
Type of device (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S21)
Operating system (OS) information (e.g., iOS 14.5)
System settings (e.g., enabled/disabled status for Location Services)
Time zone
Mobile carrier
IP address
Names and/or identifiers for Apps on your Device integrated with SDK
Network Information
VPN status
Network protocols employed
Device connectivity information (e.g., how a device connects to a network) and signal strength
Network information such as mobile network code and mobile country code

3. How We Use The Information We Collect Through Our Services
When we collect information through the Services, OUTLOGIC
or its customers who receive the data
may use it for any of the following purposes:
To Make Inferences based on collected data, including movement patterns and research
:
Movement Patterns
: To make inferences regarding the location and movement patterns of individuals or devices. For example, we might record location data from Devices at certain points of interest over time, like shows, sporting events, restaurants, etc., and we may include this information in the Services.

Interest-Based Audiences and Targeting Ads
:
Interest-Based-Audiences
: We use the information we collect to organize Device users into audience segments based on their inferred interests (for example, that a Device user is interested in attending sporting events, or certain kinds of retail stores). This enables our Clients to deliver advertising to those users when they are recognized on their own platforms.
Targeting Ads
: By using audience segments, advertisers increase their chances of sending an ad that is more likely to be relevant.
Ad Measurement
:
Ad Measurement Analysis
: We use information we collect (such as location information and Advertising IDs) to assist advertisers with analyzing ad campaign performance – for example, by measuring how (or whether) Devices that were served with a particular ad engaged with the advertiser’s products or services. This is sometimes called ad measurement or attribution analysis.
An example of ad measurement analysis would be if certain Devices were served with an advertisement for “OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop” on Wednesday, and location data then showed traffic at OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop on Thursday or Friday was higher than average, OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop might conclude that its ad campaign performed well.
Publisher Analysis
:
Analysis and Compliance
: We assist our Publisher partners with analyzing how Users engage with the Publishers’ Apps, and in activating that information for advertising, to generate revenue, and to enhance App functionality.
We may also use this information to provide Publishers with options for complying with certain laws, regulations, and other rules where applicable.

We have contracts with businesses that assist us with our own business operations (e.g., our Site, database hosting, fraud detection and prevention, verification and reporting, data hygiene, human resources, marketing and advertising, and email services), as well as billing or accounting functions, collections, technology, and other forms of operational support.
With Our Affiliates
:
In the event we establish a subsidiary or otherwise become affiliated with another company, we may share any information that we have collected with those entities.
In Relation to Legal Proceedings or Process
:
We may share information we have collected when we have a legal obligation to do so. This may include compliance with a binding court order, exercising, establishing or defending OUTLOGIC’s legal rights, or those of Clients or any other third party, or in good faith to comply with the requirements of any applicable law or legal process.
Similarly, we may disclose any information we have collected as required to respond in good faith to legal process, including subpoenas (whether civil or criminal), court orders or search warrants.
To Investigate Malfeasance and to Defend Ourselves or Third Parties
:
We may share information to assist us in enforcing our legal rights, our Terms of Service, or other policies as applicable, or to investigate any potential violation of the same.

In Relation to a Corporate Transaction
:
If a third party seeks to acquire or actually acquires our business or assets in whole or in part, we may disclose information we have collected in connection to that transaction (including without limitation during due diligence that may be undertaken in advance of possible sales).
6. User Choices & Opt-Out Tools
You can manage the way that we use data collected passively from your Device in connection with the OUTLOGIC Site and the Services (e.g. Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, or cookies) as described below:
Browser Settings
: You may adjust the privacy and security settings of your web browser to change how your browser uses cookies.
Opting Out of Interest Based Advertising on Mobile Devices
: You can opt out of tailored advertising on mobile devices by companies that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting the NAI’s Mobile Choices Page and following the instructions provided there.
You can opt out of interest-based advertising on your browser by participating companies by visiting the
NAI’s opt-out page
or the
DAA’s Consumer Choice Page
. Residents of the EEA, UK and Switzerland may refer to
www.youronlinechoices.com
. The opt-out tools provided on these industry pages are generally based on cookie technologies. As such, if you delete your cookies (or change or update your web browser) you will need to repeat the opt out process. While our Services are generally not based on cookie technology, we are providing this information because we may partner with businesses to tailor ads for our own Services that do (for example, to retarget Visitors of Sites with advertisements). Further, certain third-party platforms may use information we have collected to match identifiers across devices – such as to tie a mobile Advertising ID by common IP Address to a browser-based cookie ID.
OUTLOGIC Opt-out:
You may limit the ways we use certain information we have collected by submitting an opt-out request by visiting this link:

7. Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect our physical infrastructure as well as in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks. These measures are intended to protect our systems (and the information contained therein) from loss, misappropriation, misuse, alteration or disclosure. No method of electronic transmission or storage is perfectly secure, however, so we cannot guarantee the security of information we collect with absolute certainty.
8.
The European Union and UK and Protections Under European Privacy Laws (GDPR and UK GDPR)
We (and those using our Services) are required to provide certain information about the processing of “Personal Data” of users in EEA and Switzerland under the GDPR of users in the UK under the UK GDPR. For purposes of this explanation, we will refer to both as “GDPR.” “Personal Data” generally refers to data that identifies or is capable of identifying a particular user or Device. Names and addresses, cookie IDs, Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, precise location information, and biometric data are examples of “Personal Data.”
If you have any questions about OUTLOGIC’s processing of Personal Data in the context of the GDPR, You may contact our Chief Privacy Officer by emailing your questions to
privacy@outlogic.io
, or contact our EU Representative at
eurep@outlogic.io
.
The representations and information we provide below, which are applicable only to individuals located in the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, are provided for purposes of compliance with the GDPR. Please do not rely on the information below if you are not located in one of those regions.
Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data:
Under the GDPR, we must disclose the legal bases we rely on to process Personal Data. Our legal bases for processing Personal Data for the purposes we describe in
Section 2
and
Section 3
above and
Section 5
as to our corporate data) include:
Consent
. We rely on your consent to provide our Services that use precise location information related to other Personal Data. We also rely on your consent to store and access information on your Device (e.g., Advertising IDs and Installation IDs). Our reliance on consent is in turn often in reliance on compliance steps required of and taken by our data suppliers and by Clients that use the Services. These steps are intended to confirm that your consent is collected in compliance with the GDPR and passed on to Clients and business partners such that we only facilitate the collection of data in compliance with the law. We may rely on your consent to process Personal Data in other circumstances as well. When we do so, we will follow applicable laws pertaining to providing and withdrawing consent. We also attempt to obtain consent for certain of our clients to process Personal Data. These Clients, in turn, may be independent data controllers as to data in their own possession and control.
Legitimate interest
. We may rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data in some cases. We may do so when we use Personal Data for purposes of maintaining the security of our services (including to detect and prevent fraud or to facilitate the detection and correction of bugs or other errors). We also rely on legitimate interest when we use our own Clients’ Personal Data (or our Site Visitors’ Personal Data) to communicate with them about their use of our Services, or to analyze user activity on our Site.
Contractual Agreements
. In some cases our basis for processing Personal Data is that the processing is necessary pursuant to a contractual relationship we have entered into (such as records and contact information related to our Clients).
You may obtain a copy of our SCCs document by contacting us at
privacy@outlogic.io
.
Legal Obligations
. We may process Personal Data when it is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
Transfers of Personal Data:
When we collect Personal Data in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, and then transfer it outside of those jurisdictions, we take measures to ensure that such Personal Data is protected by appropriate safeguards. In general, our transfers of Personal Data rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and Data Processing Agreements to safeguard that data where the GDPR or other European data protection laws require it. You may use the contact information below to request a copy of these SCCs.
How We Retain Personal Data
: We generally retain Personal Data we collect for as long as is necessary to either (1) provide our Services (absent a deletion or opt-out request); or (2) for other purposes including compliance with our legal obligations, dispute resolution, and to enforce our contracts. Our schedule for retaining Advertising IDs, Installation IDs,
and related location data
is as follows: Advertising IDs and Installation IDs we collect in order to provide our Services are rendered inactive by us within 12 months after the time we last obtained your consent; however, we may retain data beyond 13 months where we have de-identified it (i.e., altered it in such a way that it cannot be linked to Personal Data). We may retain this (and other) information insofar as we have a legal or operational need to do so, for example, for purposes of auditing, corporate record-keeping, legal compliance, accounting, security and bug-prevention purposes.
Rights of Data Subjects:
Data Subjects have certain rights in connection with the Personal Data that data controllers process about them pursuant to the GDPR. These include the right to access Personal Data, the right to request correction of inaccurate Personal Data, the right to request the restriction of processing of Personal Data, the right to request deletion of Personal Data, and the right to object to processing of Personal Data (including when we process Personal Data to build a profile for targeted digital advertising). We describe these rights more fully below.
Right to Access
: You may contact us at
privacy@outlogic.io
in order to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller. We will respond to your request by explaining the steps you must follow to access your Personal Data after we receive your request. Because we are required to verify the identity of the individual making a request before we provide access to Personal Data, we will evaluate requests to exercise certain rights to access Personal Data on a case-by-case basis. In conducting this evaluation, we may consider both (1) the effort involved in verifying whether Personal Data that we process actually pertains to the data subject making the request – and only to that data subject; and (2) any potentially negative consequences that may result from erroneously releasing Personal Data to an individual other than the data subject, in light of the sensitivity of the Personal Data at issue and the degree of certainty we can achieve through verification. We may also limit the amount or kind of Personal Data we will release in circumstances where we believe it is likely that the improper release of Personal Data would adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the data subject. We will only honor requests for access to Personal Data for which we act as a data controller, as explained more fully in sub-section (d) below. Where we act as a processor for Personal Data on behalf of another entity (for example, our Clients), you may contact that company instead of OUTLOGIC to make a data access request.
Right to Correct
: You may exercise your right to correct Personal Data by contacting us using the contact information provided below.
Right to Withdraw your Consent or Object to our Personal Data Processing
: You may use the opt-out methods described in
Section 6
of this Privacy Notice to withdraw your consent for our processing of your Personal Data (when we are relying on your consent). If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your Personal Data in connection with our Services within 30 days or fewer.
Right to Request Deletion
: You have the right to request that we delete Personal Data concerning you that we process as a controller. If you use the opt-out process described above, we will also delete your Personal Data. You may also contact us at
privacy@outlogic.io
to request that we delete your Personal Data. We will provide further instructions on how you can exercise your right to deletion after we receive your email request. In certain circumstances we may keep copies of Personal Data in back-up files (or otherwise in inactive form), for certain of our internal purposes that are important to our business, including legal, auditing, accounting and billing, bug-detection and correction. We may keep such backups for as long as is necessary to fulfill those purposes.
Right to Make Complaints
: You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our processing of Personal Data with a relevant data protection authority. If you have a complaint, please contact us first to allow us to assist you in resolving it.
OUTLOGIC may act as either a data controller or a data processor in connection with the Personal Data we process, depending on the circumstances. EU data protection law distinguishes between companies that process Personal Data for their own purposes (i.e. “data controllers”) and companies that process Personal Data on behalf of and at the direction of other organizations (i.e. “data processors”). When we act as a data processor for other organizations, such as for our Clients, we may direct your requests or inquiries to the relevant data controller that is responsible for the processing of your Personal Data.
9. Children’s Data
We do not intend for our Services to be used in connection with minors under the age of 18, and we do not intentionally collect data from them. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected of any such data, please use the contact information provided in
Section 12
below to let us know.
10. Additional Information for U.S. Residents Including Residents of California, Montana, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and other States with Applicable Privacy Rights
US residents have data deletion rights as described in this
Section 10
. In addition, California residents have certain privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”), and Virginia residents have similar privacy rights under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act of 2019 (“VCDPA”), with respect to personal information or personal data about them.

B. The Business Purposes We Have for Collecting and Sharing Personal Information
Our purposes for collecting and sharing Personal Information are described below (with examples). These details are also described in our Privacy Notice:
Tailored Digital Advertising
:
Working with advertisers, agencies and the technology platforms they use to: (1) target (such as by creating inferenced audience groups), send, tailor, optimize and analyze advertising and marketing messages in websites, mobile apps or across other channels; and (2) measure and analyze the effectiveness of those messages.
Create “identity” graphs to assist our Clients in finding users across multiple channels. This may include linking personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (eg, Advertising ID, Installation ID, IP address).
Research for Marketing and Other Purposes
:
We provide information for purposes including financial and market research, for the study movement patterns, for urban planning, for smart cities research, or for educational purposes. We may also share information with government entities or public health organizations who wish to study movement patterns for disease prevention research, for physical security or defense purposes or information security, to prevent crime, or for civic, disaster and traffic planning.
To Operate Our Services
: We use personal information to:
Enhance, test, update, and verify our own data and data-related services
Develop new products or services
Operate, analyze, enhance, and secure our services
Other Internal Business Purposes
:
We use personal information for internal research or operations, auditing, detecting and responding to security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance. Information we collect from our Sites and from Apps may be used for the above, in addition to our own marketing purposes.
Sharing for Purposes of Legal Compliance:
We may share personal information with third parties for purposes of: (1) compliance with official legal process or a regulatory investigation (for example, a valid subpoena or court order); (2) enforcing our Terms of Service, this Privacy Notice, or other agreements, including investigation of suspected violations of the same; (3) responding to claims that certain content violates the rights of third parties; or (4) protecting the rights, property or personal safety of us (or our platform), our Clients, our affiliates, our agents, our platform users, or the general public. Similarly, we may share personal information with other entities to detect or prevent fraud, to prevent spam or malware, or other similar purposes.
Sharing In Connection With a Corporate Transaction:
In the event of a major corporate transaction (such as a merger, investment, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, or sale of some or all of our assets), we may share personal information in connection with that transaction, including for purposes of associated due diligence.
Sharing With Our Service Providers:
We may share any personal information we collect with our service providers. Our service providers may include, for example, providers of: technology; support for our Clients; business operations; web or database hosting; billing; accounting; physical or information security; marketing and advertising; data management, validation, enhancement or hygiene; or providers that otherwise assist us with providing, developing, maintaining, or improving our Services.
Aggregate Information:
We may use personal information to create aggregate information, or may de-identify any personal information we collect to make it such that it cannot be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate or De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate or De-Identified Information for any purpose, including, but not limited to, for research and marketing purposes. We may also share Aggregate or De-Identified Information with third parties, who may include advertisers or marketers, promotional partners, our sponsors, or otherwise at our discretion.
C. Rights and Choices of US States Residents
If you are a resident of any US state, you have the right to request that we delete personal information collected from you, including data that may reveal your mobile device’s precise geographic location, and also send requests to any recipients of your personal information that they delete such data from their commercial databases (your “deletion rights”). If you choose to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which we may nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as to prevent, detect, or investigate data security incidents, or to protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity directed at the company. The right to delete is separate from the right to opt-out of data sales as provided in Applicable States laws. We describe below how you may exercise your deletion rights.
In addition to data deletion, if you are a resident of an Applicable State, you may have
additional rights including
the right to request (1) that we disclose what personal information we collect from you; and (2) to opt out of our sale of your personal information. The states that provide these rights to their residents include but are not limited to California (under the CCPA), Colorado (under the CPA), Connecticut (under the CTDPA), Utah (under the UCPA), and Virginia (under the VCDPA),
as well as other Applicable States, as we have stated above.
These rights are subject to certain limitations, although you will not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. In certain circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee to process your request to the extent permitted by law.
Right to Opt-out of the Sale of Your Personal Information
:
Residents
of Applicable States
may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. “Sale” is defined broadly by
various state laws,
to include making personal information available in exchange for any monetary or other valuable consideration.
To “opt out” of our “sale” of your personal information you may use either of the methods below:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
By emailing your opt-out request to
privacy@outlogic.io
using a subject line that reads “Data Transfer Opt out.”
Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
:
If we have collected personal information from you, you may request that we delete such personal information. A request to delete is distinct from a request to “opt out” of our sale of your personal information. You may contact us by email at
privacy@outlogic.io
or call us toll-free at +1 (866) 346-9602 to exercise this right.
If you choose to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which we many nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as:
To defend against fraudulent activity directed towards our business, systems, or users.
To detect and fix technical issues that affect existing system functions (e.g., for de-bugging).
As necessary for the protection of the free speech or other rights of us (or others).
To assist with law enforcement requests made pursuant to lawful process.
For certain scientific or historical research purposes.
For our own internal purposes, provided they are reasonably related to your relationship with us.
To comply with our legal obligations.
Please note that we require certain information in order to provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete that information, it may prevent you from being able to access or use our Services.
Opt-Out/Access/Deletion Requests Metrics-2024
From January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, we maintained processes to facilitate requests pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act. We received the following requests, and responded as follows:a. As to requests to know:
We received 10
We complied with 2
We denied 8, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
b. As to requests to delete:
We received 141
We complied with 8
We denied 133, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
c. As to requests to opt out of sale:
We received 543
We complied with 94
We denied 449, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
d. We received an additional 24,800 requests by a purported third-party automated data deletion service. Such requests could not be processed, due to service’s failure to provide the necessary identifying information despite our repeated requests.
Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information
:
Applicable States may give their residents the right to request that we disclose both the categories and specific pieces of personal information that we collect, use, or sell. We will comply with data access requests if we can verify them to a legally sufficient degree. You may make such an access request by emailing us at
privacy@outlogic.io
with the subject line “Data Access Request” or by calling us toll-free at +1 (866) 346-9602.
We may be able to adequately verify access requests for certain information we have collected. However, in line with certain guidance provided by the California Attorney General, we do not provide location data in response to access requests due to the fact that we are not able to verify to a reasonably high degree of certainty that the location data we have collected pertains to the individual making such a request, or whether either an individual with custody of a device — or the person making the request — is the rightful owner of the device to which the information we hold pertains. For example, it is not uncommon for a person to be in possession of another person’s phone temporarily (for example, a partner, friend or work colleague’s mobile phone or tablet), whether or not such temporary possession is authorized. We take this approach in order to avoid a scenario where such a person in temporary possession of a phone might obtain potentially detailed and sensitive information pertaining to the phone’s owner through a request for access. We also believe California law compels us to avoid a scenario like this. In addition, a recent study found that roughly 50% of mobile phones were not password protected at all, making the possibility of such “spoofing” a tangible risk. Further, we do not have other, more conventional means to confirm the identity of a device’s true owner because for consumer privacy reasons we do not collect information such as name, address or email address that could be used to do so.
If you do not wish location data associated with your device to be used in the ways we describe above, we suggest that you make a request to opt out of sales of your information as detailed above. You can find complete information about how to exercise your right to opt out by visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
Our Collection of Sensitive Personal Information, and Your Rights to Limit Its Use
:
Certain Personal Information that we collect and sell, such as precise geolocation of a person, household, or device, is considered “Sensitive Personal Information” under the data privacy laws of California (CCPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), and Virginia (VCDPA)
and other Applicable States
. We obtain the right to use and share this information, through the consent methods described in our Privacy Policy. California residents have the right to require a business to limit the use of their Sensitive Personal Information to only certain internal business purposes specified in the CCPA.
To limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information, you may use either of the methods below:

applicable privacy
rights or to learn more about how to do so, residents of those
Applicable
States may contact us using any of the following means:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
By emailing your request to
privacy@outlogic.io
.
With respect to access or deletion requests, by calling us toll-free at: +1 (866) 346-9602.
In certain circumstances, we may not disclose some personal information to you in response to an access request where doing so presents too great a risk to you or our business. We may also withhold such information where we cannot verify your identity in connection to such personal information.
To learn about how to opt out of Tailored Advertising, please review and consider whether to use the industry opt-out mechanisms provided on the
NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) page
. We believe that opting out using these industry tools may be more efficient, faster, and more uniform compared to using manual opt out processes.
In the event we are not able to comply with your requests fully for any of the reasons described above, we will still explain the reasons why we could not fulfill your request. Certain consumers have the right to appeal our decision not to fulfill a request, and may do so by emailing our Chief Privacy Officer at
A
ppeals@outlogic.io
with the subject line “Privacy Choices Appeal”.
Right to Non-Discrimination
:
If you elect to exercise your rights

1. INFORMATION FOR VISITORS OF THE WEBSITES AND APPS
In general, you may visit the Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. When you contact us or submit an inquiry via the Sites, we may collect personal contact information from you, which may include your name, address, email address, and phone number. We may use that information for internal purposes, including, among other things, to respond to your inquiries.
In addition, we may automatically collect technical information (collectively, “Analytics”) from the device you are using to access the Sites, such as a desktop computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other internet enabled device (each, a “Device”). Technical information about your Device includes, but is not limited to: device type, operating system, settings and system configurations, IP address, Device ID and other unique Device identifiers, and mobile network information, as well as, your activity using the Sites, such as data about the pages you access, traffic to and from our websites, the dates and times associated with transactions, web and app log data, and other event information, including crashes and system activity. We may use Analytics for research and internal purposes, such as to improve the Sites so that it is more useful and accessible to you and provide relevant advertising to you. Analytics may be correlated with your Personal Data (as defined by the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the UK General Data Protection Regulation: data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for instance, names, addresses, cookie identifiers, mobile device identifiers, and precise location data) but not shared with any third parties.
We collect Analytics using certain technologies, such as:
Cookies are small data files that have unique identifiers and reside, among other places, on your Devices, and on the web pages of the Sites. Among other things, cookies help us improve and personalize your use of the Sites. We may permit certain third parties to place cookies through the Sites to provide us with better insights into the use of the Sites and user demographics and to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Sites. For example, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns for the Sites. Google Analytics generates a cookie to capture information about your use of the Sites that Google uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services. Google may use a portion of your IP address to identify its cookie and for its commercial purposes. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here, or if located in the UK or European Union click here. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
Web Beacons. Web beacons or “pixels” are electronic images that may be used on the Sites or in emails we send to you. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and effectiveness of offers, and tell whether you open an email and act upon it.
You may block, delete, or disable cookies or web beacons to the extent permitted by your browsers, applications, and Devices as described in more detail below. However, if you do so, the performance of certain features of the Sites may be limited or not work at all.
We may share Information collected from visitors of the Sites as described below.
You may opt not to receive promotional emails from us by contacting us as indicated below or by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any promotional email you receive from us, or by contacting us at privacy@cuebiq.com. Please note, however, that we may still send you non-promotional, transactional or service-related emails about your relationship with us.
2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
Location Intelligence
Cuebiq offers location intelligence services that provide Customers location-based, AI-driven analytics and measurement to map and measure the consumer journey, helping Customers answer strategic questions and make the right decisions. We collect and process device identified data from users who consent to location data sharing via our partners apps for purposes related to advertising, attribution, analytics, research, and cross-device identity (“Location Data”).
Location Data is received either from an “SDK” (software development kit) that it provides to mobile application partners (“apps”) or from a server-to-server transfer and integration with mobile app partners. This location information includes data points such as lat/long (latitudinal and longitudinal) data, i.e., GPS-level data, and/or WiFi data (if feasible) associated with a mobile advertising ID, such as an IDFA on iOS platforms or a Google Play Advertising ID on Android platforms.
Platforms
Cuebiq operates a PaaS or platform-as-a-service (“Spectus PaaS” or “PaaS”) which provides our Customers an open, secure, and privacy controlled environment to analyze, create, optimize, and export data of all types and sources through a combination of data and tools provided to them (including, but not limited to Location Data), tools and data they may develop or import on their own, or obtain from third parties via PaaS. Cuebiq acts as a data processor in operating PaaS, which means that Cuebiq acts only upon instructions from PaaS Customers. Each PaaS user that uploads data and makes it available to other PaaS customers is responsible for the content, compliance, and permissible uses of that data and must communicate any limitations to other PaaS customers.
Cuebiq also operates a SaaS or software-as-a-service (“Clara”) where we provide precomputed reports for Customers. Cuebiq acts as a data controller in operating Clara, which means that we direct the processing of Location Data to generate the reports for Customers.
We refer to all of the above services as the “Services.”
3. THE DATA ELEMENTS WE COLLECT IN PROVIDING OUR SERVICES
With your consent, when you have accessed or used an App or Site that uses the Services, we collect certain information, including your Personal Data as defined under the UK General Data Protection Regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation or Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act, (which we refer to collectively as “Information”) about your Device and your activity and interaction with such App or Site, which may include:
IP address
Geolocation and proximity of your device if location services are enabled on your device and consent has been provided to the App to access those services
Unique device identifiers such as advertising IDs (Google Advertiser ID or IDFA) – collectively referred to as “Mobile Ad ID”, vendor IDs and/or a pixel identifier
Event information about your device, such as crashes, system activity, and hardware settings
System configuration information
Time and date information
Dwell time at or near points of interest the device’s location services
Other device movement information such as acceleration or altitude
Sources of Personal Information:
Mobile applications, Websites, Consumer Data Resellers, Business Partners
Categories of Personal Information collected, sold, or shared in the past 12 months:
Identifiers, Geolocation Data, Internet or other electronic network activity and information, Inferences drawn from Personal Information, Professional or Employment Related Information (This information is only collected or shared)
If you choose to provide us with information that may be considered “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, such as your precise geolocation, you are consenting to our processing of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions in Section 7 of this Privacy Policy. Cuebiq does not use precise geolocation data to create products or services with sensitive health based locations, nor do we permit our customers to do so. In addition, to further comply with specific state laws, we use commercially available information to assist in filtering out precise location data for sensitive locations in those states.
The above Information is sent to our server in encrypted form, via an HTTPS protocol either through an Application Protocol Interface (“API”), or through a publisher that has licensed our software development kit (our “SDK”) thus providing the information through that SDK, or via a direct server-to-server integration with Cuebiq
Cuebiq may receive non-app user data through public data sources or data partners. Some of our partners aggregate public, user consented psychographic and demographic data, television content and ad viewing data, or other forms of transactional data such as purchase information.
4. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION TO PROVIDE LOCATION INTELLIGENCE
Advertising: We use the information we collect to make inferences about what types of activities users tend to spend time doing. For instance, we may notice a particular Device frequently at locations associated with sports (e.g., an arena), music (e.g., a concert venue), eating out (e.g., restaurants) or fitness (e.g., a gym or yoga studio). We use this information to categorize Device users into “interest segments” – which advertisers can use to tailor advertising to those users who appear on mobile ad platforms they work with. To see examples of those segments, please
click here
.
Cuebiq or its partners may use the information we collect to identify additional interest segments that may be relevant to device users, or to identify other anonymous users that are likely to share similar interests as Cuebiq users for tailored advertising purposes.
Attribution: We also use some of the information we collect (including location information, IP Address or mobile advertising IDs) to help advertisers analyze aggregate ad performance – such as by measuring whether or how Devices that saw a particular ad, whether it be in the physical world, in the digital world, or on TV, tended to engage with a particular product. In addition, we sometimes use any or all of the above information to help advertisers better understand their customers or their marketing, such as for market research, customer analytics, or analytics of traffic patterns. For example, data such as velocity and altitude may be used to determine a user’s mode of transportation (car, bicycle, walking, etc.) or to determine if a user is inside a location or above/below the location on a different floor of the same building. IP address may also be used for filtering out fraudulent activity, such as that from bots.
We sometimes collect the above data through “pixels” (described above) (“Pixel Data”), and we use such data to perform aggregated “attribution” analysis. This analysis can help marketers and their service providers understand which users have been exposed to which ad campaigns. This data may be measured or matched against aggregate location data in order to provide a “match rate” for an attribution study as to devices that have been detected at a given location – to provide similar services and analysis for marketers as those described above. For instance, if numerous devices that were sent an ad or offer for “Cuebiq Coffee” on Tuesday then went to a Cuebiq Coffee on Wednesday or Thursday, an advertiser might conclude that the ad campaign was successful.
Analytics: We help Customers better understand the offline consumer journey with location analytics for use cases, such as: offline competitive intelligence, market-share, consumer preferences, consumer mobility, path-to-purchase and footfall analysis. This helps them identify areas of growth and activate those insights to drive performance. For example, real estate companies use location analytics to identify geographic areas with expanding foot traffic for future development to better serve consumers. This may include sharing more detailed device and location information to allow Customers to bridge their own analytics with Cuebiq to develop combined aggregate insights.
Research: We work with research partners to allow them to derive inferences about traffic patterns to support causes such as improving the quality of life in underserved communities, natural disaster response, and smart city development through our
Data for Good
initiative.
Cross-Device Identity: Cuebiq may use the various identifiers that it has collected from your device, such as Mobile Ad ID (MAID), Device ID or ID for Vendor (IDFV), other Device IDs, IP Address, hashed forms of persistent identifiers such as an email address (for example, an email address has gone through a one-way transformation process that does not reveal the actual email address to Cuebiq but could be used to link to experiences together where the same email address was provided to different parties), and information about your device (such as model, operating system type and version, carrier) in combination with the location information you have provided to Cuebiq with consent to help recognize you and your device across the internet. Cuebiq may also share this information with partners, and receive similar information, to collectively allow each party to better recognize you and your device across the internet. This form of identification may sometimes be based on probability and not certainty that one ID is related to another ID. You may opt-out of cross-device identity at any time – please see your options in the Privacy Controls section.
Cuebiq contractually requires compliance with our Sensitive Points of Interest (SPOI) Policy that covers categories that are legally or culturally sensitive and that we will not allow to be used for advertising or attribution. This policy can be found
here
. Additional restrictions or exceptions may apply depending upon circumstances or jurisdiction.

We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized to act on your behalf.
When you or your authorized agent request a copy of your information associated with your verified mobile device held by Cuebiq, we will provide (i) your Information, (ii) the source of the Information; (iii) the purposes and methods of the processing; and (iv) the logic applied to the processing. On our Partners page you will find the identities of data controllers and data processors with whom we may share your Information.
If you believe that the processing that concerns your Information was unlawful or unnecessary for the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently processed you have the right to lodge a complaint as outlined in Section 13 below.
Cuebiq does not discriminate against users that choose to exercise one or more of their privacy choices. Below you will find instructions on how you may exercise the above-mentioned rights by contacting Cuebiq using one of the methods listed:
Opt-Out / Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
Cuebiq provides multiple paths for you to retract your initial consent (opt-out) to data collection in connection with the Sites and the Services, and to engage in other privacy controls such as access, portability and erasure. Once we receive your opt-out, we stop collecting Information from you (including “sensitive information” as defined in certain jurisdictions), remove your Information from being sold or shared and add you to the opt-out list that we share with all
partners.
You may control how your browser responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your web browser.
You may limit the location information being shared with Cuebiq by deactivating location services for your device entirely or with the app partner more directly.

For iOS mobile devices, go to “Settings” from your Device’s home screen; scroll down to “Privacy”; select “Advertising”; and turn on “Limit Ad Tracking” (not available on iOS14 or higher). For Android mobile devices, go to “Google Settings” on your device; select “Ads”; and check the box labeled “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads.” We honor these “limit” or “opt out” instructions or “flags” by removing recognized devices from our cross-app advertising or ad delivery and reporting solutions, on a going forward basis.” For users of iOS14 or higher, please select an alternate opt-out path.
You may opt-out via the
privacy request form
on our website
Suppliers and Customers may also provide ways for you to opt out from or limit their collection of information from and about you. Please refer to their privacy policies to learn more. Please note that Cuebiq is not responsible for the privacy practices of Suppliers, Customers, and other third parties.

website
and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
website
.
Please note that these opt outs only apply to interest-based advertising by participating advertisers. You may still receive other types of online advertising from participating advertisers, and the websites you visit may still collect information for other purposes.
In addition, the opt-out choices you select are stored in opt-out cookies only in the browser that you use to visit the opt-out websites, so you should separately set your preferences for other browsers or devices you may use. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences, so you should visit these opt-out websites periodically to review your preferences or update your preferences to apply to new participating advertisers.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third parties. We do not currently recognize or respond to DNT signals

Privacy Policy - Apps & Connectivity Assistant
This Privacy Policy applies to use of the Opensignal (“
Opensignal
,” “
we
,” “
us
,” or “
our
”) mobile application and data we collect through, mobile applications operated by one of our partners (each, a “Partner”) who has implemented our Software Development Kit, or “
SDK
.”
The purpose of this Policy is to inform you about our privacy practices and to ensure that you understand the purposes for which we collect and process personal data, how we look after your personal data, and inform you of your privacy rights.
1. WHO WE ARE
Opensignal works with the global telecom ecosystem to help it understand and improve network speeds and network coverage for consumers like you. We provide application performance analytics and connectivity insights to our Partners while helping companies optimize networks in the areas that need it most. Opensignal takes great pride in providing a service that benefits many as we work toward our vision of advancing connectivity for all.
When you opt-in to allowing Opensignal to collect network performance readings from your device, we work with our Partners and companies in the telecom ecosystem to provide you with a better network and application experience. We rely on your choice and consent to initiate any transfer of data (and you can withdraw consent and opt-out at any time through the application). Our mobile application Partners support us entering into this relationship with you by facilitating our disclosure and consent process. We do not collect anything that directly identifies you or your mobile handset. We aggregate or depersonalize all data prior to sharing with our customers.
This Privacy Policy describes how we, Opensignal, collect, use, and share the data that you consent for us to collect, including personal data, when you opt in to allow us access to data in connection with the network performance experienced through a mobile application operated by one of our Partners.
As a company whose livelihood depends on data and its proper treatment, Opensignal takes data privacy and security very seriously. As such we have taken steps to go well beyond basic privacy and data protection requirements.
We request your consent to collect information relating to the network performance your device experiences, which may include certain types of personal data described below, in order to measure the performance, availability and/or signal quality of communication networks (the “
Opensignal Services
”).
Opensignal is the controller or joint controller and, as applicable, is responsible for the collection, control and processing of personal data that we collect from your device. If you have any questions or concerns about Opensignal’s use of your personal data, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.
IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS AS A RESIDENT OF COLORADO, CONNECTICUT, OR VIRGINIA, PLEASE SEE YOUR DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS IN SECTION 9. IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT, PLEASE SEE THE CCPA SUPPLEMENT BELOW IN SECTION 10. IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS AS A RESIDENT OF NEVADA, PLEASE SEE YOUR NEVADA PRIVACY RIGHTS IN SECTION 11.
2. MOBILE APPLICATIONS
At Opensignal, we use mobile network experience measurements to publish independent reports and insights on the real-world mobile network experience of everyday users worldwide. We obtain the relevant data by collecting measurements relating to signal reception and quality from mobile devices. The Opensignal mobile application and our Partner’s mobile applications (each, a “Mobile Application”) enable us to request your consent to our data collection. If you consent to initiate our collection of data, we may collect data from your mobile device when you are using a Mobile Application and/or when it is running in the background pertaining to network and wireless device experience.
WHAT DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT AND USE THAT DATA
The different kinds of personal data we may collect includes location data, device data and usage data as described further below.
The purpose of collecting limited device data is to measure the experience that devices have on wireless networks. If consent has been granted, we take measurements from devices from time to time including location data (which include GPS coordinates or similar information regarding the location of a network reading taken from your device), network type, network operator, cellular and Wifi signal strength and quality, IP address, and the identifiers of connected cell towers and Wifi routers (including both BSSID and SSID). Location readings are not tied to a device identifier such as a mobile handset MAC or IMEI, which we do not collect, and are instead the locations of network experience readings for purposes such as building general heatmaps of good and poor performance. We measure the performance of the data connection including the speed, responsiveness and reliability along with the total amount of data transferred. We collect crash logs data and diagnostics to ensure that our software does not negatively impact consumer experiences.
We collect information from environmental sensors on devices (depending on which ones are integrated in the device), which allows us to measure things such as the device acceleration, orientation and the external atmospheric pressure and light intensity. We also measure some internal device conditions – such as battery temperature and voltage. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how instantaneous device conditions may affect the experience of wireless networks. To better understand differences between devices, we collect data on device hardware such as the model, manufacturer, and manufacturers and models of sub-components (such as the cellular radio) and the capabilities of these components (for example the number of cores on the CPU). Similarly, to understand differences caused by software, we collect information on the mobile platform version used and whether custom ROMs or Android skins are installed, as well as the operating system. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how device properties affect the experience of wireless networks.
When a Mobile Application containing our SDK is installed and consent is provided, an identification code (“Resettable ID”) is randomly generated by our software and allocated to that installation instance rather than the device when we take measurements. A different and unique Resettable ID will be generated by each Mobile Application on a particular device. New installations of the same Mobile Application will also generate new unique Resettable IDs. Resettable IDs are random, unrelated to each other, specific to Opensignal, and not shared externally. To further help us manage the data, we also collect IP addresses, as these may indicate which telecom carrier network is being accessed and is impacting your experience. This document does not encompass or detail Opensignal's handling of internal employee or customer data. Opensignal's employees and customers may provide personal information through the regular course of business and Opensignal separately handles the governance of that data.
We prevent user identification; we do not collect name, email address, phone number, social media ID, contact list, Mobile Advertising ID, mobile handset MAC/IMEI, or anything else which directly identifies an individual or their specific device. For the avoidance of doubt, we also do not collect any special categories of personal data about you as defined in GDPR. We aggregate or depersonalize all data prior to sharing with our customers.
THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE YOUR DATA
The purposes for which we collect, store, and then aggregate or depersonalize personal data for external use are the following:
We do not use the measurements we take from mobile devices for any individualized user identification or individualized user tracking. Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users allow us to measure the performance of a carrier and the service availability, quality and performance of numerous communication networks across the world and over time. For example, we use data to improve wireless networks, research market performance, identify aggregate trends in device and network utilization patterns, understand the network-based drivers of subscriber churn and acquisition, and design effective network performance communication campaigns. Furthermore, we use data for the purpose of providing aggregated telecommunications network flow share, market share and other market analysis, using proprietary algorithms generating observations of market behavior, activations and deactivations across the telecom infrastructure. We publish some of the aggregated or depersonalized statistical data that we generate and we provide it to our customers (such as network operators) to help them understand, communicate and optimize their own network’s service coverage, performance and signal quality (and those of their competitors). We also create aggregated or depersonalized information.
We use data to test, monitor, improve or upgrade the Mobile Applications or SDKs, to meet our legal obligations and the regulatory requirements to which we may be subject, for loss prevention purposes and to protect and enforce our rights and meet our obligations to third parties, and for our internal business purposes, such as compiling and analyzing usage information for general operational, statistical and business purposes.
Our Customers and Partners are not permitted to use our data to identify the mobile applications or publishers that our data has been received from. We collect data from various mobile applications, and our reports, data, and documentation do not reveal which mobile applications the source data was collected from. We do not publicly disclose our Partners without their permission.
3. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR DATA
We collect and process personal data based on your express consent. If consent is provided, it can be withdrawn via measures provided by the Mobile Application, such as through the personal settings menu in the Mobile Application (but that will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent). In respect of any personal data collected from devices with your consent we also rely on our legitimate interest in conducting our business and in carrying out statistical and scientific research work and in providing analytical data to our clients and improving global connectivity for users like you.
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
Opensignal participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. Opensignal’s identification number within the framework is 1263.
4. HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION
Service Providers. We may share datasets containing personal data as part of private contracts we have with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf in connection with the Opensignal Services, such as cloud service providers for storage and the processing required for depersonalization. Where this information is shared with such third parties, we obligate the third-party service provider to manage the information only on our behalf and solely for our benefit (and not for its own benefit).
Business Change. If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction, or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer databases containing personal data to successor party or parties in connection with such transaction or change in ownership or legal structure.
Necessary Disclosure. Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the Opensignal Services; (ii) comply with laws, subpoenas, warrants, court orders, legal processes or requests of government or law enforcement officials; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety or property, or that of our users or others; (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding known or suspected illegal activities; fraud; our rights, reputation, safety or property, or those of our users or others; violation of the Terms of Use, our policies or agreements; or as otherwise required by law.
Subsidiaries and affiliates. We may share the data that we collect from users’ mobile devices with the Opensignal subsidiaries and affiliates, with the purpose of bringing together complementary data on consumer experience, network performance, and subscriber behavior.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
5. HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
We take appropriate measures to protect personal data collected through the Opensignal Services against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, destruction or modification. These include physical, technological, contractual, and administrative measures.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, accurate, complete, or current. Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.
6. HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION
Any personal data which may be contained in the sets of measurements of mobile network signal performance described above is only retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of personal data, the purposes for which we process personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
7. COUNTRY OF PROCESSING
We operate globally. The collection of data from devices takes place in the country where the device is used. We store and otherwise process data (including personal data) through third party cloud service providers who offer a range of global storage location options. We store personal data records predominantly through third-party cloud service providers on servers located in the United States of America. When transferring personal data records to a country which does not provide an adequate level of protection to privacy rights, we put in place appropriate safeguards including data transfer agreements.
8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
The Opensignal Service is not directed to children and is intended for use by adults only. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal data from individuals under 18 years of age. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any information through the Opensignal Service and do not provide your consent for the use of your data.
9. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
Data subjects may have the following legal rights depending on applicable law in respect of their personal data that we process:
The right to require Opensignal to confirm whether or not your information is being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any information that has been disclosed, the period for which your information is to be stored and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in relation to your information;
The right to require access to the personal data and to require Opensignal to rectify inaccurate information;
Where Opensignal has relied on the ‘consent’ basis for processing that information, the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This right to withdraw consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
The right to request the erasure of their information. You can make a request for erasure where:
the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected;
where the processing of the information is based on your consent (and the other circumstances described in the ‘Legal Basis for Processing Your Data’ and ‘How We Share Personal Information’ sections above no longer apply), if you withdraw your consent; or
where the personal data is processed by Opensignal solely on the basis of our ‘legitimate interest’, if you withdraw your consent for the processing of your data and you object to the processing of your personal data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing (such as, for example, the achievement of the purpose of using your data for statistical or scientific research purposes or where the processing of the data is required to meet statutory obligations or for the defense of legal claims).
Where Opensignal has disclosed your information of a data subject to a third party and you request the erasure or rectification of the data, Opensignal will take any steps required under relevant laws to inform the third party of such request.
The right to require Opensignal to restrict its processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that data is disputed or an objection has been raised. In such circumstances, Opensignal will only process that information with your express consent, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest;
Where data is processed based on your consent or to fulfill a contractual obligation provided for by law, you have the right to receive your personal data from Opensignal in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
The right to object to the processing of personal data where:
a.Opensignal relies solely on the ‘legitimate interest’ basis for processing that data, in which case we will be legally required to stop processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your privacy rights and interests; or
b.the information is used for direct marketing purposes, in which case we will immediately stop processing your information for such purposes.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (www.ico.org.uk) or in some cases with the data protection supervisory authority or regulator of the jurisdiction where you reside. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the authority or regulator, so please contact us in the first instance.
You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us to another organization, or to you, in certain circumstances.
The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or would seriously impair their attainment. In addition, there are, consistent with relevant laws, limitations on our ability to honor requests to exercise these rights for data that cannot be linked to a verified request, such as where data has been de-personalized.
To exercise these rights, please call us at (+44) 020 3289 3375 or email us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.   You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to appeal a refusal to take action on your request; to do so, please see any applicable instructions in our response to your request. We will aim to respond to any request within one month. Please note that we cannot fulfill requests to know the specific pieces of personal information that we may have collected about you. In order to disclose the specific pieces of personal information that we may have collected about you, we would have to verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty. Given the limited amount of information that we collect about you, we do not maintain enough data points to verify your identity to the reasonably high degree of certainty required by relevant law.
Our data processing activities do not include the sale of personal data, the use of personal data for targeting advertising, or the use of personal data for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, although we may disclose aggregated or depersonalized data with external sources, as described above. As a result, we do not honor rights to opt out of these practices in jurisdictions that recognize such rights.
You can also authorize another person, called an agent, to exercise your rights on your behalf. You must provide the authorized agent written and signed permission to act on your behalf. We may deny requests from an authorized agent who does not submit proof that he or she has been authorized to act on your behalf. Furthermore, we may require you to verify your identity directly with us. We may also require you to directly confirm with us that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit a request on your behalf. An authorized agent can make a request on your behalf by either calling us at (+44) 020 3289 3375 or by emailing us at

We do not provide a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information, because in the event that we collect certain sensitive personal information, we do not use it to infer characteristics such that we would be required to provide a right to limit.
To the extent that anything in this Section 10 conflicts with this Privacy Policy, this Section 10 shall govern.
The categories of California consumers’ personal data we may have collected are listed above in the Section – HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR DATA. We may disclose the following categories of data to our customers, although personal information is aggregated or depersonalized before it is shared: (1) Location, (2) Identifiers such as IP address, and (3) Internet or other electronic network activity information, all of which we have collected from your mobile device. We may collect the categories we’ve previously identified (which include GPS coordinates or similar information), network type, network operator, cellular and Wifi signal strength and quality, and the identifiers of connected cell towers and Wifi routers (including both BSSID and SSID). We also measure how data is flowing, both passively (by monitoring how fast it moves through other Mobile Applications), and actively (by running a test that downloads or uploads data within our SDK). We do not monitor the content of your data usage. The goal of collecting the above data is to measure the experience you have of wireless networks. We also collect information from environmental sensors on your device (depending on which ones are integrated in your device), this allows us to measure things such as the device acceleration, orientation and the external atmospheric pressure and light intensity. We also measure some internal device conditions – such as battery temperature and voltage. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how instantaneous device conditions affect the experience of wireless networks.
To better understand differences between devices, we collect data on your device hardware such as the model, manufacturer, and manufacturers and models of sub-components (such as the cellular radio) and the capabilities of these components (for example the number of cores on the CPU). Similarly, to understand differences caused by software, we collect information on the mobile platform version used and whether custom ROMs or Android skins are installed. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how device properties affect the experience of wireless networks.
When you first use a Mobile Application an identification code (“Resettable ID”), is randomly generated by our software and allocated to that installation instance rather than the device whenever we take measurements. A different and unique Resettable ID will be generated by each Mobile Application on a particular device. New installations of the same Mobile Application will also generate new unique Resettable IDs. Resettable IDs are random, unrelated to each other, specific to Opensignal, and not shared externally. To further help us manage the data, we also collect IP addresses, as these may indicate which telecom carrier network is being accessed and is impacting your experience.
We use this data for the purposes listed above in the Section – THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE YOUR DATA. Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users allow us to create a detailed picture of the service availability, quality and performance of numerous communication networks across the world and over time.
We may have shared certain categories of personal data listed in the Section - HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR DATA to the third parties listed in the Section - HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION for a business purpose and in order to provide the Opensignal Services. We may have shared the following categories of personal information: (1) Location, (2) Identifiers, such as IP addresses, and (3) Internet or other electronic network activity information, all of which we have collected from your mobile device. We may have shared the following categories of personal data with the following third parties or may do so in the following instances:
Service Providers
.
We may share datasets containing personal data with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf in connection with the Opensignal Services, such as cloud service providers for storage and the processing required for depersonalization. Where this information is shared with such third parties, we obligate the third-party service provider to manage the information only on our behalf, and on our written instructions and solely for our benefit (and not for its own benefit).
Business Change
.
If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction, or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer databases containing personal data to successor party or parties in connection with such transaction or change in ownership or legal structure.
Necessary Disclosure
.
Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the Opensignal Services; (ii) comply with laws, subpoenas, warrants, court orders, legal processes or requests of government or law enforcement officials; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety or property, or that of our users or others; (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding known or suspected illegal activities; fraud; our rights, reputation, safety or property, or those of our users or others; violation of the Terms of Use, our policies or agreements; or as otherwise required by law.

AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “AppLovin”) operates a suite of tools for app developers and other businesses to automate and optimize the marketing and monetization of their platforms, products, or services by enabling the placement of different types of advertisements on digital properties including mobile apps, websites, and connected TV devices (collectively, the “Advertising Services” or “Services”).  As explained below, consumers interact with us in a few ways, primarily through advertisements served by AppLovin on behalf of advertisers.
The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our Services and advertising platform, and our corporate website at www.applovin.com (the “Website”), as well as your choices related to that information.

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.
General Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer who downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services through advertisements served within a digital property, we may collect certain information, including the following:
Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;
Carrier;
Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);
Network connection type and speed;
IP Address;
Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services;
HTTP header information;
Advertising IDs (IDFA/GAID/Amazon FOSAID);
Vendor IDs (IDFV);
App Set IDs; and
Advertising and tracking preferences and restrictions.
Application publishers may choose to share with us additional information including your age or year of birth, gender, email, phone number, and interest segments for purposes of their own direct ad serving.  We do not retain this data or pass it downstream to advertising partners.  Please see the applicable publisher’s privacy policy for more information about their use of first party data.
Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here
, current as of the date listed at the top of that page.
If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, please see the
“Manage Your Privacy Choices”
section below. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or Switzerland, you may also see the
“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.

If you believe we have served an advertisement to a child or might have any personal information from or about a child, or if you believe a mobile application in which an AppLovin-served advertisement appeared may be designed for, directed to, or pass personal information knowingly from, children in violation of our policies, please contact us via email at
dataprotection@applovin.com

Data Security and Retention
We implement reasonable measures to help secure the information we collect through the Services. We retain the data we collect through the Services for up to 2 years.

Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals
If you are located in the European Union, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, the following additional provisions apply to you.
Data Privacy Framework
AppLovin complies with the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, AppLovin commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact AppLovin at
dataprotection@applovin.com
. AppLovin refers unresolved complaints to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
for more information or to file a complaint.  These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you.
For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website.
Lawful Basis for Processing
On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide services to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning our products and services.
On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers, where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
If the processing of your personal data is necessary, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you if there is no other lawful basis for such processing. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of personal data should be sent to us as specified in the “Contact” section below.

AppLovin does not collect or seek to elicit “Sensitive Information”.
