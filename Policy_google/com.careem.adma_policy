Applicable Law provides various legal bases for the Processing of Personal Data. Careem Technologies will Process your Personal Data where it determines that one or more of the following grounds apply:
Contractual necessity:
Processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are a party, or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract. For example, to provide and maintain our Services and to send administrative or Service-related messages.
Legal obligation:
Processing is required to comply with a legal obligation to which Careem Technologies is subject. For example, to send receipts and screen Captains and Users before enabling certain services.
Consent:
Processing is based on your consent. Consent will be relied upon for certain voluntary processing activities involving special categories of data, where no other legal justification is available, or where Processing is required under local law. For example, to send marketing communications.
In specific countries, Applicable Law may permit the Processing of Personal Data based on Careem Technologies’ legitimate interests. Where this is the case, Careem Technologies will rely on this legal basis if the Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by Careem Technologies or a third party, provided that these interests are not outweighed by your rights and freedoms that require protection of your Personal Data.

Applicable Law provides various legal bases for the Processing of Personal Data. Careem Technologies will Process your Personal Data where it determines that one or more of the following grounds apply:

Processing is required to comply with a legal obligation to which Careem Technologies is subject. For example, to send receipts and screen Captains and Users before enabling certain services.
Consent:
Processing is based on your consent. Consent will be relied upon for certain voluntary processing activities involving special categories of data, where no other legal justification is available, or where Processing is required under local law. For example, to send marketing communications.
In specific countries, Applicable Law may permit the Processing of Personal Data based on Careem Technologies’ legitimate interests.

Privacy commitment and scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“
Privacy Policy
”) describes how Personal Data is collected and used by Epsilon when providing our Services. We care about your privacy, and we want you to understand how we process Personal Data and what choices you have with regards to it. We have taken steps to provide you with this information as clear and easy as possible, but if you have any questions you can always
Contact us
.
We believe that data protection is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet and that a personalised experience online can provide significant benefits to users if done properly. In accordance with these believes, Epsilon creates results for advertisers in revolutionary ways without compromising users’ privacy or data protection.
By getting familiar with this Privacy Policy, you have taken the first step in understanding how advertising businesses such as ours help contribute to the Internet’s ability to remain a diverse ecosystem of free content, as well as provide a better digital browsing experience.
What does Epsilon do?
While you visit digital properties, such as websites and mobile applications, there are almost always third-parties working behind the scenes to help provide you with a great digital experience. These companies provide services such as analytics, advertising and fraud prevention for retailers, publishers, and other organisations. Epsilon is one of these companies and we help provide the advertising that keeps your favourite blogs free, your favourite stores in business, and your advertising experience more relevant.
Epsilon provides its clients with digital advertising and personalised content across the Internet. To make some of these things possible, and to make smarter decisions, we need to use information that is considered Personal Data. You can read more about the different Services we provide to our clients on our website:
https://www.epsilon.com/
Use of Cookies and Device access
We will only use Cookies or otherwise access your device (for example by using a Tag) if you have provided us with consent to do so, as and if required by applicable laws (including Data Protection Laws). If so, you may have provided us with consent through a consent management platform (CMP) on one of our clients’ or partners’ digital properties. If you want to withdraw your consent to Epsilon, please visit our
Consumer Request Portal
.
What Personal Data do we process?
Pseudonymous Personal Data
Epsilon uses Tags and Cookies to collect Pseudonymous Personal Data about the browser or device you are using, including Visitor Data and information about your browsing behaviour, such as what digital properties that you have visited and online transactions that you have made. This type of Pseudonymous Personal Data is processed whenever you visit digital properties and open emails where our Tags are implemented, including digital properties belonging to our clients and partners.
We are a part of the digital advertising ecosystem and involved in activities such as Real-Time-Bidding (“
RTB
”). RTB is a set of technologies and practices used in programmatic advertising that enables advertisers to compete for available digital advertising space and place online adverts on digital properties by automated means. RTB allows for certain information to be sent to participants of the digital advertising ecosystem in Bid Requests. Bid Requests normally contain information that constitutes Personal Data, such a Visitor Data. This information is used by participants to evaluate the bid opportunity and respond with a bid price to serve an advert on the digital property. We only process Pseudonymised Personal Data that we receive in Bid Requests.
We perform Cookie syncs with advertising exchanges and other partners, which means that we receive and share Cookie IDs or other pseudonymised identifiers with each other. This enables us to recognise information about the user and determine whether we want to respond to a Bid Request or not.
We also partner with third parties to receive Pseudonymous Personal Data about transactions made by individuals. This type of Personal Data is mainly Processed to enhance our understanding about what individuals are interested in and what they might purchase in the future, including to create profiles for personalised advertising and content, use such profiles to select personalised adverting and content and to measure advertising and content performance. We combine this type of Personal Data with other categories of Personal Data that we Process.
All location data we process is limited to non-precise location data.
Direct Identifiable Personal Data
Some of our clients provide Direct Identifiable Personal Data such as name, address, email address and associated transactional information, to us.
The Directly Identifiable Personal Data we receive from our clients is referred to as “
Offline Data
” in this Privacy Policy. We process the Offline Data in a separate environment, and it is pseudonymised before it is processed for the purposes below. We annually engage a third-party auditor to confirm this pseudonymisation process.
How Personal Data is used and lawful basis
Purpose
Description
Lawful basis
Use limited data to select advertising
Advertising presented to you can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Consent
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your online activity (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information on your previous activity on other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you. Your profile can be used to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests.
Consent
Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Consent
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Consent
Use limited data to select content
Content presented to you can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you)
Consent
Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your online activity (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you. Your profile can be used to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interest.
Consent
Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you can be based on your content personalisation profile, which can reflect your online activity (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Consent
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Consent
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Consent
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve our services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Consent
Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you may encounter in your interaction with the content and ad.
Consent or Legitimate Interest (if this basis is applicable in your jurisdiction)
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Consent or Legitimate Interest (if this basis is applicable in your jurisdiction)
In support of one or more of the purposes set out above we may use Personal Data that we hold to determine whether different devices are likely to belong to you or your household and to try and distinguish your device from other devices based on information it automatically sends, such as IP address or browser type. This helps us develop a predictive profile of your interests across these different devices, including making sure we do not show you the same advert too often.
Consent is obtained via our clients and partners, often through consent management platforms (CMPs) on their digital properties. Epsilon’s legitimate interests (if this basis is applicable in your jurisdiction) include, providing our Services and ensuring that our clients are only paying for advertising that is viewed by a natural person (e.g. not a bot).
We will also receive and save information about the privacy choices you make regarding the purposes listed above. This is necessary in order to enable us to respect such choices.
Social media
We sometimes engage social media platforms to display direct marketing to you on their platform. We use “list-based” and “look-a-like” tools to do this. Using list-based tools involves the uploading of Personal Data to the social media platform in question (such as a list of email addresses). The platform then matches the uploaded Personal Data with its own user base. Any user that matches the uploaded list is added into a group that will be sent the selected marketing message. Look-a-like tools offer the ability to build other audiences based on the characteristics of an original audience that was created using a list-based tool. These audiences generally comprise of users that have not previously engaged, but who look like the list-based audience (i.e., they are users with similar interests, behaviours or characteristics). When creating this sort of audience, the social media platform uses Personal Data it has about other users of its platform to find users who match the interests and behaviours of users that are current customers. Examples include Facebook Custom Audiences or LinkedIn Contact Targeting. We will not undertake this processing unless you have provided us with consent for the purposes set out above, and we have contractual controls in place to ensure that the social media platform can only use the Personal Data we share to enable the provision of the Services. We are not responsible for the data practices of social media platforms and recommend you read their own privacy policies.
Who do we share Personal Data with?
We share your Personal Data:
With our Affiliates and processors that assist us in providing our Services. This includes our Affiliates in the United Kingdom, India and the United States of America.
With our clients. For example, we may share Personal Data collected by Tags on our clients’ digital properties to help our clients learn more about their visitors, and Personal Data collected when an advert is delivered to report on the performance of advertising and to help clients understand how often they are serving an advert to the same individual and to help them optimise.
With participants of the advertising ecosystem such as advertisers, publishers, advertising exchanges, data management platforms, demand side platforms and supply side platforms, to be able to participate in RTB activities.
With social media platforms as described above.
Third-parties in the event of any reorganisation, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stocks (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
As we believe necessary and appropriate: (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal processes and obligations; (c) to respond to requests from public and governmental authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

How long do we keep Personal Data?
