B.
WHAT INFORMATION WE OBTAIN
When you use a Digital Service, we may obtain various types of information related to you and your use of the Digital Service. This may include information that directly identifies you such as your name, address, or contact information (this type of information may be called “personal information,” “personal data,” or “personally identifiable information”). Certain pieces of information we obtain (for example, account login, payment card information, race or ethnicity) may be considered “sensitive” under privacy laws. The information we obtain generally consists of information (1) you give us about yourself, (2) you give us about others, (3) automatically collected about your interactions with the Digital Services and our content or ads on third-party websites, apps or other media, and (4) we get from other sources.
1. Information you give us
We may ask you to provide information about yourself when you use the Digital Services. For example, to subscribe to one of our newsletters, you will need to give us an email address. You may not be able to use certain features if you choose not to submit the requested information.
The information you give us may include details such as:
Contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address or phone number). This may be your personal or professional contact information if you are a dealer.
Information you provide in auction listings, including vehicle year, make, model, geographic location, vehicle identification number (“VIN”) and other vehicle related information and/or information about any other products or services you may list or make available on, or in connection with, the Digital Services.

Information collected for compliance with legal or regulatory requirements. Depending on the country, this may include your date of birth, tax identification number, and place of birth.
2. Information you give us about others
You may give us information about other people, such as the name and email of a friend or contact with whom you want to share our content. Do not give us information about others unless you are authorized or have their consent to do so. We will use their information for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.
3. Information automatically collected
The Digital Services automatically log certain information about visits to the Digital Services, such as the number and frequency of visitors, technical information about browsers and devices used to access the Digital Services, and information about crashes or other technical issues. We and our service providers may collect data from your browser or device for analytics and measurement purposes. In addition, depending on your jurisdiction, we and third parties may automatically collect certain information through automated means about your activities over time across the Digital Services as well as across third-party sites, apps or other media. The tools that collect this information vary depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, and software development kits (“
SDKs
”). These technologies may be included in our web pages, mobile apps, emails, and other digital content. The tools may assign or collect unique cookie IDs or other identifiers associated with your browser or device. The tools may collect information while you are using our Digital Services or while they are running in the background of your device.
The information automatically collected may include:
Information about your computer, device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version).
Internet protocol (IP) address, which may be used to derive your general geographic area (e.g., city and country).
Device identifiers (e.g., mobile advertising IDs) or unique identifiers (e.g., based on hashed contact information).
Information about your interactions with the Digital Services, including browsing and search activities and clickstream data that reflect the content (including advertising) and website features you have accessed, clicked on, viewed, or otherwise interacted with.
Information about how you accessed the Digital Services, including details about websites or apps visited immediately before or after accessing a Digital Service.

Cookies and similar technologies on the Digital Services may be served directly by BaTMedia (referred to as “first-party cookies”) or by others such as data analytics companies (referred to as “third-party cookies”). Cookies and similar technologies are browser- and device-specific and may endure for different periods of time. Some are deleted automatically once you close your browser or exist the Digital Service. These are sometimes referred to as “session cookies.” Other cookies are “persistent cookies,” meaning that they remain on your device after your browser is closed.
You have the right to choose whether or not to accept certain cookies and similar technologies. However, if you choose to refuse or remove cookies and similar technologies, this could affect the availability of and functionality of the Digital Services, as applicable.
For more information about the use of automated means in the context of targeted advertising and how you can limit tracking for advertising and marketing purposes, see

Operators of third-party sites or apps, content distribution channels and platforms (e.g., Roku, Amazon Fire TV), voice-activated assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) or other devices and technologies when you interact with our content, products, services or ads available on those channels and platforms. The information we receive may include information about the content you view or access as well as your demographic information and information about your interests.

They may provide us with demographic information, information about your transactions, and other information that helps us learn about you and other users of the Digital Services.
Social Media Platforms and similar services (“Social Media Platforms”). When you engage with our content or ads on Social Media Platforms, or interact with features on the Digital Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms (e.g., login or sign in features or tools that allow you to share our content with others on Social Media Platforms), we may obtain information from Social Media Platforms, including your username, user ID, demographic information and other information, subject to the settings and privacy practices of the relevant Social Media Platform. We may obtain this information directly from the Social Media Platform or through plug-ins, integrations or applications. Please keep in mind that
operators of the Social Media Platforms may also gather information
about your use of the Digital Services and their features and tools.
C.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN
If you make a transaction using a Digital Service, we use your payment card information (e.g., your card number and expiration date) for limited purposes such as to process your transaction (including recurring payments, if applicable), to provide you with the requested products or services and for the purposes described under the section “To protect our rights or the rights of others” below.
Please note that if you successfully win a bid or complete a transaction with another user or third party that may be integrated with the Digital Services, we will provide the other user or third party, as appropriate, with your personal information to facilitate the transaction you requested (including, your name and contact information). Other users (including sellers) and third parties are independent from us and are responsible for the handling and use of your personal information, including personal information that we may provide to them. Sellers and third parties are responsible for compliance with applicable laws, including privacy laws, and rights that you may have with respect to your personal information that such users, sellers and third parties maintain. You should direct any questions or concerns with respect to your information directly to such users, sellers and third parties.
With respect to information other than your payment card information, we use that information:
1. To provide you with the Digital Services.
This includes:
Processing your requests regarding the Digital Services and our products or services, including listing or placing a bid or offer on a listed vehicle or any other products or services, or your participation in a survey, sweepstakes, contest, promotion, event or similar initiative. This also includes the publication and promotion of your listings and related content on other sites, apps or digital properties operated within our family of companies and/or cooperating with third party operators of sites, apps and other digital properties for such publication and promotion.
Providing customer assistance or technical support and solving problems or disputes relating to auctions or fee claims.
Customizing content, providing recommendations and enhancing the quality and your overall experience with the Digital Services, including by retaining your user preferences or presenting content in the most effective manner for the browser or device you use to access the Digital Services.

This includes:
Developing, managing and conducting advertising and marketing campaigns, promotions and offers, including about our content, listings and our products and services or third parties’ products, services and other initiatives.
Targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) is advertising based on your interests in topics and content based on your activities over time on the Digital Services and online services operated by third parties, as well as information from other sources, including information collected offline. Targeted ads may consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and may be displayed to you based on various factors, including the context of the site or app in which they appear (e.g., sports or travel section), information you provided to the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created an account), your activities on the site or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household information. Depending on your jurisdiction, we may engage in the following activities:
On the Digital Services and on third-party sites, apps or other media, we, our service providers and third parties may use automated means to (a) collect information for targeted advertising purposes or (b) serve you targeted ads. These automated means vary depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, and SDKs. These technologies may use unique identifiers associated with your browser or device to support targeted advertising.
We may use and/or combine online and offline information we obtain about you, including your personal information, for targeted advertising purposes. We may hash information, including your personal information (such as an email address), and may disclose it, including for targeted advertising purposes or other advertising and marketing initiatives. We may aggregate the information we obtain to create audiences that are most likely to respond to ads based on demographic, interests or household information. Targeted ads may be displayed to you by third parties, such as ad networks or exchanges.
There are steps you can take to limit the collection of your information for targeted advertising purposes. These steps vary for the web and mobile app environments and are browser and device specific. To learn more about targeted advertising and opt-out choices, see
https://youradchoices.com/control/
and in the section DAA Industry Opt-Out.
In serving targeted ads, we adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance.
Cross-device linking. If you access the Digital Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the Digital Services and our content or ads published elsewhere. This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice). See
section E. Website (Browser) Opt-Outs
for steps you can take to limit browser and mobile app tracking for targeted advertising purposes.
Analyzing and measuring the performance, effectiveness and reach of our advertising (including targeted ads) and marketing efforts on the Digital Services and elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION
This Privacy Notice (the “
Privacy Notice
”) applies to the website, mobile application or other digital service (each a “
Digital Service
”) linking to this Privacy Notice and owned or operated by Bring a Trailer Media LLC dba BaTMedia (“
we
”, “
us
”, “
our
” or “
BaTMedia
”). This Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices of BaTMedia only and does not cover the practices of other users with whom you may engage through the Digital Services or other companies, including those that may advertise or sponsor content, products or services on the Digital Services.
B.
WHAT INFORMATION WE OBTAIN
When you use a Digital Service, we may obtain various types of information related to you and your use of the Digital Service. This may include information that directly identifies you such as your name, address, or contact information (this type of information may be called “personal information,” “personal data,” or “personally identifiable information”). Certain pieces of information we obtain (for example, account login, payment card information, race or ethnicity) may be considered “sensitive” under privacy laws. The information we obtain generally consists of information (1) you give us about yourself, (2) you give us about others, (3) automatically collected about your interactions with the Digital Services and our content or ads on third-party websites, apps or other media, and (4) we get from other sources.
1. Information you give us
We may ask you to provide information about yourself when you use the Digital Services. For example, to subscribe to one of our newsletters, you will need to give us an email address. You may not be able to use certain features if you choose not to submit the requested information.
The information you give us may include details such as:
Contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address or phone number). This may be your personal or professional contact information if you are a dealer.
Information you provide in auction listings, including vehicle year, make, model, geographic location, vehicle identification number (“VIN”) and other vehicle related information and/or information about any other products or services you may list or make available on, or in connection with, the Digital Services.
Demographic, interests and household information (e.g., age, gender or education).
Payment information for transactions made through the Digital Services (e.g., payment card number, expiration date and billing information collected via our third-party payment processors).
Comments, photos, videos and other content or information you choose to publish on the Digital Services or otherwise share with us, including photos of vehicles which may include license plate information.
Information you provide when you choose to participate in surveys, polls, sweepstakes, contests or promotions (including information about your participation in activities that may generate loyalty or rewards points).
Location information, which may include precise location information when you permit the Digital Services to access device location. To prevent the collection of precise location information, please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or device manufacturer.
Other information you may allow us to access through your device’s permissions settings, such as your contacts or address book.
Transactional and activity information (e.g., data regarding listings, bids, requests and other transaction-based content that you generate or derived from your activities).
Information collected for compliance with legal or regulatory requirements. Depending on the country, this may include your date of birth, tax identification number, and place of birth.
2. Information you give us about others
You may give us information about other people, such as the name and email of a friend or contact with whom you want to share our content. Do not give us information about others unless you are authorized or have their consent to do so. We will use their information for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.
3. Information automatically collected
The Digital Services automatically log certain information about visits to the Digital Services, such as the number and frequency of visitors, technical information about browsers and devices used to access the Digital Services, and information about crashes or other technical issues. We and our service providers may collect data from your browser or device for analytics and measurement purposes. In addition, depending on your jurisdiction, we and third parties may automatically collect certain information through automated means about your activities over time across the Digital Services as well as across third-party sites, apps or other media. The tools that collect this information vary depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, and software development kits (“
SDKs
”). These technologies may be included in our web pages, mobile apps, emails, and other digital content. The tools may assign or collect unique cookie IDs or other identifiers associated with your browser or device. The tools may collect information while you are using our Digital Services or while they are running in the background of your device.
The information automatically collected may include:
Information about your computer, device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version).
Internet protocol (IP) address, which may be used to derive your general geographic area (e.g., city and country).
Device identifiers (e.g., mobile advertising IDs) or unique identifiers (e.g., based on hashed contact information).
Information about your interactions with the Digital Services, including browsing and search activities and clickstream data that reflect the content (including advertising) and website features you have accessed, clicked on, viewed, or otherwise interacted with.
Information about how you accessed the Digital Services, including details about websites or apps visited immediately before or after accessing a Digital Service.
Demographic, interests and household information.
Information about your interactions with email messages and other communications, such as whether you opened or forwarded the email or clicked on links contained in the email.
Cookies and similar technologies on the Digital Services may be served directly by BaTMedia (referred to as “first-party cookies”) or by others such as data analytics companies (referred to as “third-party cookies”). Cookies and similar technologies are browser- and device-specific and may endure for different periods of time. Some are deleted automatically once you close your browser or exist the Digital Service. These are sometimes referred to as “session cookies.” Other cookies are “persistent cookies,” meaning that they remain on your device after your browser is closed.
You have the right to choose whether or not to accept certain cookies and similar technologies. However, if you choose to refuse or remove cookies and similar technologies, this could affect the availability of and functionality of the Digital Services, as applicable.
For more information about the use of automated means in the context of targeted advertising and how you can limit tracking for advertising and marketing purposes, see
section C. 3 For advertising and marketing purposes, including targeted advertising
.
4. Information we obtain from other sources
We receive information about you from other sources and it may be combined with other information about you. For example, we may obtain data from:
Operators of third-party sites or apps, content distribution channels and platforms (e.g., Roku, Amazon Fire TV), voice-activated assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) or other devices and technologies when you interact with our content, products, services or ads available on those channels and platforms. The information we receive may include information about the content you view or access as well as your demographic information and information about your interests.
Third-party data suppliers such as data aggregators, data resellers, public databases and business partners where permitted by applicable law. They may provide us with demographic information, information about your transactions, and other information that helps us learn about you and other users of the Digital Services.
Social Media Platforms and similar services (“Social Media Platforms”). When you engage with our content or ads on Social Media Platforms, or interact with features on the Digital Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms (e.g., login or sign in features or tools that allow you to share our content with others on Social Media Platforms), we may obtain information from Social Media Platforms, including your username, user ID, demographic information and other information, subject to the settings and privacy practices of the relevant Social Media Platform. We may obtain this information directly from the Social Media Platform or through plug-ins, integrations or applications. Please keep in mind that
operators of the Social Media Platforms may also gather information
about your use of the Digital Services and their features and tools.
C.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN
If you make a transaction using a Digital Service, we use your payment card information (e.g., your card number and expiration date) for limited purposes such as to process your transaction (including recurring payments, if applicable), to provide you with the requested products or services and for the purposes described under the section “To protect our rights or the rights of others” below.
Please note that if you successfully win a bid or complete a transaction with another user or third party that may be integrated with the Digital Services, we will provide the other user or third party, as appropriate, with your personal information to facilitate the transaction you requested (including, your name and contact information). Other users (including sellers) and third parties are independent from us and are responsible for the handling and use of your personal information, including personal information that we may provide to them. Sellers and third parties are responsible for compliance with applicable laws, including privacy laws, and rights that you may have with respect to your personal information that such users, sellers and third parties maintain. You should direct any questions or concerns with respect to your information directly to such users, sellers and third parties.
With respect to information other than your payment card information, we use that information:
1. To provide you with the Digital Services.
This includes:
Processing your requests regarding the Digital Services and our products or services, including listing or placing a bid or offer on a listed vehicle or any other products or services, or your participation in a survey, sweepstakes, contest, promotion, event or similar initiative. This also includes the publication and promotion of your listings and related content on other sites, apps or digital properties operated within our family of companies and/or cooperating with third party operators of sites, apps and other digital properties for such publication and promotion.
Providing customer assistance or technical support and solving problems or disputes relating to auctions or fee claims.
Customizing content, providing recommendations and enhancing the quality and your overall experience with the Digital Services, including by retaining your user preferences or presenting content in the most effective manner for the browser or device you use to access the Digital Services.
Maintaining, operating, improving and developing the Digital Services and related content, products or services, including developing new products and features based on users’ interactions with the Digital Services.
Learning about users of the Digital Services and analyzing how you and others interact with and respond to the Digital Services, including by measuring and optimizing usage, reliability and performance, conducting market research, analyzing trends, and supporting our operations (e.g., for accounting, auditing, financial, legal or other purposes).
2. To communicate with you.
This includes:
Sending you informational messages about the Digital Services (e.g., to confirm your listing or bid, and notify you of changes to a Digital Service).
Delivering marketing or promotional communications, including offers or promotions about our or third parties’ products, services or other initiatives.
Responding to your questions or addressing your requests.
Communicating with you about surveys, sweepstakes, contests, promotions or events.
3. For advertising and marketing purposes, including targeted advertising.
This includes:
Developing, managing and conducting advertising and marketing campaigns, promotions and offers, including about our content, listings and our products and services or third parties’ products, services and other initiatives.
Targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) is advertising based on your interests in topics and content based on your activities over time on the Digital Services and online services operated by third parties, as well as information from other sources, including information collected offline. Targeted ads may consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and may be displayed to you based on various factors, including the context of the site or app in which they appear (e.g., sports or travel section), information you provided to the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created an account), your activities on the site or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household information. Depending on your jurisdiction, we may engage in the following activities:
On the Digital Services and on third-party sites, apps or other media, we, our service providers and third parties may use automated means to (a) collect information for targeted advertising purposes or (b) serve you targeted ads. These automated means vary depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, and SDKs. These technologies may use unique identifiers associated with your browser or device to support targeted advertising.
We may use and/or combine online and offline information we obtain about you, including your personal information, for targeted advertising purposes. We may hash information, including your personal information (such as an email address), and may disclose it, including for targeted advertising purposes or other advertising and marketing initiatives. We may aggregate the information we obtain to create audiences that are most likely to respond to ads based on demographic, interests or household information. Targeted ads may be displayed to you by third parties, such as ad networks or exchanges.
There are steps you can take to limit the collection of your information for targeted advertising purposes. These steps vary for the web and mobile app environments and are browser and device specific. To learn more about targeted advertising and opt-out choices, see
https://youradchoices.com/control/
and in the section DAA Industry Opt-Out.
In serving targeted ads, we adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance.
Cross-device linking. If you access the Digital Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the Digital Services and our content or ads published elsewhere. This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice). See
section E. Website (Browser) Opt-Outs
for steps you can take to limit browser and mobile app tracking for targeted advertising purposes.
Analyzing and measuring the performance, effectiveness and reach of our advertising (including targeted ads) and marketing efforts on the Digital Services and elsewhere.

The section below provides more information about these settings.
DAA Industry Opt-Out
Depending on your jurisdiction, some of the ads you see on the Digital Services are targeted ads (this is also known as online behavioral advertising) described in
section C. 3 For advertising and marketing purposes, including targeted advertising
. We describe below steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of targeted ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the Digital Services. Please keep in mind that if you opt out of targeted ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests.

If you use multiple devices such as your smartphone, laptop or tablet to visit the Digital Services, you will need to submit separate requests from these devices.
Right to Opt Out of Sale/Targeted Advertising
: We may “share” your personal information with third parties for targeted advertising purposes or in ways that that constitute a “sales” under the CCPA. You may request that we not “sell” or “share” your personal information for these purposes on a going forward basis. To do so, please complete the form available at

This type of sharing does not constitute a “sale” of your personal information by BaTMedia as it is done at your direction. If you reengage with us after opting out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information, such as by submitting a bid, signing up for a newsletter and/or entering a sweepstakes or contest you acknowledge that your personal information may be used in accordance with this Privacy Notice, including in ways that may constitute “selling” or “sharing” under CCPA.
Right to Limit Processing of Sensitive Personal Information
: Certain pieces of personal information that we have about you may be considered “sensitive” under CCPA, such as debit or credit card number in combination with any required security access code, or account username and password. We limit the use of this information to what is reasonably necessary to provide the Digital Services and for purposes permitted in Section 7027(m) of the CCPA Regulations (e.g., to ensure security and integrity). If you refuse to provide such information, it may affect the delivery of the Digital Services or make us unable to provide services to you. Note that certain jurisdictions may provide individuals with the right to opt-in, opt-out, or limit the use and disclosure of “sensitive” personal information; however, personal information that we process to provide you with the Digital Services are not subject to this limitation right.
5.

After you submit a CCPA rights request you will be required to verify access to the email address you submitted.
