Why collect data?
By collecting data on app usage and about your device and Generic geographic location, such as the city you are located in, we are better able to integrate updates,
	   implement device specific testing, explore localisation opportunities and make better games that are tailored to our user's needs.
When we offer our games as free-to-play, we still require the game to generate income to help fund development costs and efforts to make the best game possible. 
	   Advertising is one way we can help cover our costs, and in order to implement relevant advertising a certain amount of non-sensitive information is required by each ad network.
IMPORTANT! By installing and playing our games you agree our privacy policy and data collection directive.

We’ve rewritten and re-arranged our Privacy Policy to be more clear about our data practices and how these may vary depending on who the data subject is - i.e. a website visitor, a customer or an end-user of mobile applications. We believe these changes make it easier to understand how we collect, use and share these information. We also updated the Privacy Policy to take into account recent regulatory changes in the US. While the text looks different, these updates don’t allow Chartboost to collect, use or share your data in new ways. Please review our new Privacy Policy
