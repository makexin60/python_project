When you use and interact with the Services, we automatically receive certain information about your device, browser, and your activity:
Device and usage information.
Our servers will record information about the device you use to connect to the Services and your usage of the Services. This information includes your device's IP address, your device type, browser type, internet service provider, operating system, and unique device identifiers. It also includes activity information, such as the frequency with which you use the Services, the duration of such usage, the pages that you navigate to, links that you click.

Geolocation information.
In order to provide services as a Shopper, you must enable your mobile device to share your location information with us. You can enable this sharing through the settings on your device or when prompted to do so in the Instacart Shopper application. We may collect your location information any time the Instacart Shopper application is running in the foreground (i.e., fully visible on the screen) or in the background (i.e., not the focus on the screen) on your mobile device.
We use precise geolocation information to determine your presence in a specific delivery zone, to assist you in finding opportunities to shop for customers, to facilitate deliveries, to track the progress of batches you accepted, and for other similar Service-related purposes. We may also use this information for internal analytics purposes.
Cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies.
When you visit our websites, access our mobile apps or otherwise interact with the Services, we (and our partners, advertisers, and third-party advertising networks) may automatically collect information about you using device identifiers, cookies and other technologies (e.g., pixels, software development kits (SDKs)).

Some services where we may advertise belong to ad networks that use your web browsing history to choose which advertisements to display on their network services, which may include advertisements from Instacart.

4. Cross-Border Transfers
Instacart
operates a global business, and we use vendors located around the world to help us run our business. Accordingly, the disclosures described above may result in the transfer of your Personal Information outside of the country or region in which you reside. For example, the Personal Information of Shoppers located in Canada will be transferred outside of Canada (and for residents of Quebec, outside of Quebec), including to the United States.
When we transfer your Personal Information outside of your country or province of residence, we do so in accordance with applicable law and take appropriate steps to ensure your information is protected. However, please note that while outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, some of your Personal Information will be subject to applicable local laws, which may permit government and national security authorities in those jurisdictions to access your Personal Information in certain circumstances.
5. Biometric Information
When you become a Shopper and at regular intervals thereafter, we process your biometric information, including biometric identifiers, to verify your identity, protect the integrity of our platform, and detect and prevent fraud. Instacart or its third-party service providers collect and process biometric identifiers (namely, scans of facial geometry) from the government identification and selfie images you provide.
The purpose of this identity verification is to promote the safety of Shoppers and our customers and to protect the integrity of our platform by ensuring that only valid and verified Shoppers provide Services.
We retain your biometric information, including biometric identifiers, until the initial purpose for collecting the biometric information has been satisfied or for up to three years following your last activity as a Shopper, whichever occurs first, after which we permanently destroy it, unless otherwise required by law. We retain your government identification and the images you provide, including to serve as your Shopper avatar, in accordance with the "Information Retention" section of this Policy.

Shoppers must be 18 years of age. Our Services are not available to minors.
7. Third-Party Websites and Services
Some links on the Services may redirect you to third-party websites and services that we do not operate. This includes links to sign up for Shopper perks that are offered by third-party companies. The privacy practices of these websites and services will be governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy policies before disclosing any Personal Information to them.
8. Information Security
We employ and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to safeguard and protect Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
9. Information Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information; the purposes for which we use the Personal Information; whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable laws that require us to retain information for regulatory purposes or permit us to retain the information to preserve our legal rights.
See the Biometric Information section above for information about how long we retain biometric information, including biometric identifiers.

The purpose of this identity verification is to promote the safety of Shoppers and our customers and to protect the integrity of our platform by ensuring that only valid and verified Shoppers provide Services.
We retain your biometric information, including biometric identifiers, until the initial purpose for collecting the biometric information has been satisfied or for up to three years following your last activity as a Shopper, whichever occurs first, after which we permanently destroy it, unless otherwise required by law. We retain your government identification and the images you provide, including to serve as your Shopper avatar, in accordance with the "Information Retention" section of this Policy.

We encourage you to review and understand their privacy policies before disclosing any Personal Information to them.
8. Information Security

9. Information Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information; the purposes for which we use the Personal Information; whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable laws that require us to retain information for regulatory purposes or permit us to retain the information to preserve our legal rights.
