We process and use personal data for example to provide essential functionalities for customers and Users, i.e. in order to match customers with Users and vice versa. In some cases, personal data may be processed in order to carry out our contractual obligations towards the User. We may use the data for example to offer essential functionalities of the Services and to provide access to the Services. If User contacts our customer service, we will use the provided information for answering questions and solving possible issues.

For quality improvement and trend analysis

For statistical and analytical purposes

In addition, we may provide customers and Users with the aforementioned statistics and reports. For clarity, such statistics and reports do not include any personal data.
For other legitimate purposes
We process personal data for the purposes of direct marketing, such as the sending of newsletters or similar marketing material. Users can unsubscribe from receiving such material at any time.

4. TRANSFER TO COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF EUROPE
The data handled within our service platform for music learning is stored within the EU/EEA.
For our website functions, we use service providers in several geographical locations, such as Google Analytics.

We will take steps to ensure that Users’ personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

We do not share personal data with third parties outside of Company’s organization unless one of the following circumstances applies:
It is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy
To the extent that third parties need access to personal data to perform the Services, Company has taken appropriate contractual and organizational measures to ensure that personal data are processed exclusively for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
For legal reasons.
We may share personal data with third parties outside Company’s organization if we have a good-faith belief that access to and use of the personal data is reasonably necessary to: (i) meet any applicable law, regulation, and/or court order; (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and/or (iii) protect the interests, properties or safety of Company, our Users or the public in accordance with the law. When possible, we will inform Users about such transfer and processing.
To authorized service providers
We may share personal data with authorized service providers who perform services for us (including data storage, sales, payment service, marketing and customer support service providers). Our agreements with our service providers include commitments that the service providers agree to limit their use of personal data and to comply with privacy and security standards at least as stringent as the terms of this Privacy Policy.

for no longer than is required or permitted by law or reasonably necessary for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes.
