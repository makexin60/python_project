2. Online Tracking and Analysis Technologies
We utilize various technologies, including cookies, web beacons, and similar tools (collectively referred to as "Technologies"), to gather personal data.
What are cookies, web beacons, and other technologies?
• Cookies
: Small text files that websites place on your device's browser. They consist of a string of alphanumeric characters that can uniquely identify your device and may contain additional information. When your browser connects to a web server within the same domain as the cookie, the server can read the cookie, enabling it to recognize your browser over time.
• Web Beacons
: Also known as single-pixel or clear GIFs, these are electronic images embedded within a website. When your browser loads a webpage containing a web beacon, it connects to the web server hosting the image, often operated by a third party. This allows the server to gather information about your device and set or read its own cookies. Similarly, third-party content on a website, such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads, triggers your browser to connect to the third-party server hosting that content.
• Mobile Apps
: May include software that allows app providers to access information about you and your device as it relates to the use of the apps.
How do we and our partners use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies?
We, along with our third-party partners and service providers, employ Technologies across our services, including websites and apps, to collect personal data. This may involve the collection of personal data related to your online activities across different websites or online services over time. We utilize this information for various purposes, such as storing your preferences and settings, facilitating sign-ins, analyzing the performance of our websites and apps, tracking your interactions with our sites or apps, generating insights, delivering and customizing interest-based advertising, combating fraud, and fulfilling other legitimate objectives. We may also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.
What controls are available?
• Advertising controls
: Some of our third-party partners and service providers who use Technologies in connection with our services are members of industry associations that provide options for managing advertising preferences. You can access these choices through the following links:
• United States
:
NAI
and
DAA
• Canada
:
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
• Browser cookie controls
: Most web browsers are typically set to accept cookies by default. However, if you prefer, you can modify your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. Please note that deleting or rejecting cookies may impact certain features or services on our website. Additionally, deleting cookies may result in the loss of settings and preferences associated with those cookies, including advertising preferences, which may need to be reset.
• Mobile advertising ID controls
: iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset advertising IDs.
• Do Not Track
: Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites your preference not to be tracked. As there is currently no universally accepted interpretation of the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
3. Use and Sharing of Personal and Sensitive User Data
