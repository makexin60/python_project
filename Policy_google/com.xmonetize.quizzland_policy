In some countries, these types of data may be considered as personal information.
Our primary goal in gathering your data is to provide and constantly improve the Services and ensure your satisfaction while using them. To achieve this, we employ different methods to gather your personal information. Below is an overview of how we collect and use your data.

If you believe that we might have collected any information about a child under the relevant age in their country of residence, please
contact us
.
Retention of your information
We keep your information only as long as we need it to provide the Services to you and fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf.
When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or anonymize it so that we can't identify you.
We categorize data into three types based on how we retain and manage it:
1. User-controlled data
This category refers to the data that you, as a user, have direct control over within your account. We'll keep this data until you remove it. For example, you can:
Edit or remove your personal info, for example your name, profile picture or bio
Delete your account entirely
Delete some device or browser-linked info if you use our Services without signing in
2. Time-limited data
This category refers to the data that we retain for a specific period of time, based on its purpose. After this period, the data is automatically deleted or anonymized. For example:
We might store data related to your device or browser dimensions for up to 12 months to ensure our Services display correctly across different devices
We might store gameplay logs for up to 12 months to provide a seamless experience when you return to the game
We may retain your answer history for up to 12 months to ensure you don't receive repeated quizzes
If you have not used your account in our Services in the last 12 months then your account may be deleted in line with our Privacy Policy. In case your User Content is used in the Services we will not delete your account until your request. We will display the deletion notice if you log into your account in the Services. We also may email you to remind you before deletion.
3. Extended retention data
This category refers to the data that we keep for longer periods due to specific legal or business requirements, for example:
Security, fraud & abuse prevention.
We retain certain data to protect you, other users, and us from fraud, abuse, and unauthorized access. For instance, we may keep information if we suspect someone is engaging in ad fraud.
Complying with legal or regulatory requirements.
We store some data to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests. This also includes enforcing our
Terms and Conditions
, especially when investigating potential violations. An example of this would be when we receive a lawful subpoena, requiring us to retain and provide certain user data.
