used, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. We are Sunspot
Studio LLC, (“Sunspot Studio” or “we”) - a developer and publisher of mobile
applications that are made available via app stores including the Google Play
Store. This Privacy Policy applies to personal information that is collected
through our mobile applications and other products (“Apps”), and websites we
control, including https://sunspotstudio.net/ (“Website”) (together

Policy and consent to our processing of information as specified therein.
1. INFORMATION

third-party ads in our Apps. In general, the information collected about you
relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps identify
your device, how you use our Apps and may include information that you submit
to us when you voluntarily contact us.
The information that we may be
collected about you through the Services broadly falls into the following
categories:
(a) Information that you provide
voluntarily
Certain parts of our Services may
ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, if you
contact us via email, we may get access to your name and/or email address as
well as any information you submit to our support team via email. This
information will never be sent to third-party partners or used by us for
advertising purposes.
(b) Information collected
automatically
When you use our Services, certain
information may be automatically collected from you and/or your device which
may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws,
such as:
Data and analytics about
     your use of our Services (e.g. session length, preferred settings, in-app
     references or just app preferences, the means by which you were referred
     to our Services)
Your IP address and
     device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers (for
     more see here “Advertising IDs and Device IDs”)

4. ADVERTISING
4.1. In General
We use advertising to fund our
Services and to make our Apps available for free.
We offer our Apps for free or at low cost and in order
to do that we allow third-party advertising partners to collect certain types
of information from you. The information types are listed in Section 1
above. The information collected helps us to improve our website and Apps and –
at the same time – keep our Apps free for a wide user base.
If you are a European Economic Area
(EEA) – based user be aware that:
(a)
When you use our Apps, we rely on our legitimate
interest to show advertisements to you. The legal basis to show ads
to EEA-based users is the legitimate interest in accordance with the
European data protection requirements under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, which
we evaluated together with our data protection officer. We also ensure to
the best of our capabilities that our external service providers are committed
to a high level of data protection and are GDPR compliant.
(b)
Before allowing any information collection by our
advertising partners for the purposes of personalized advertising, we ask for
your consent, given when you press accept at the relevant button at loading of
the App. We allow our advertising partners to show personalized ads to you only
if you have accepted in the relevant pop-up window and so consented to the
sharing of your personal information for the purposes of personalized
advertising. Our advertising partners use different technologies for the
purposes of personalized advertising that process your personal information in
different ways, so please review their data processing practices before you
accept to show you personalized ads at loading of the App. The legal basis

interest, behavior, demographics, etc. Our advertising partners may continue to
show you ads based on the content of our App.
4.2. Advertising
ID
To enable us to show in-app ads,
your advertising ID and IP-address may be sent to advertisers (or ad networks)
to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our Apps and on
third-party properties. You can control and limit the use of your advertising
ID in your device settings. We do not control which specific ads are shown in
our Apps (it is controlled by ad networks), but we do blacklist certain
categories of ads.
Advertising IDs are used by the ad
networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our
advertising partners listed here) including:
·
limit the number of times you see the same ad;
·
ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices
and not ‘automated’ bots;
·
serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to
you (if personalized ads are enabled in Privacy Settings in the App) based on
your advertising ID engagement with other brands and ads, also recorded using
your advertising ID and using your general geographic area. Other brands buy
advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their
products in Our Apps. The ad network or ad exchange acts as intermediary
between the other app companies and Us. In order for an ad network to charge
the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of other
developers’ applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, and installs
from ads are measured using Advertiser ID;
·

Privacy Policy - Apps & Connectivity Assistant
This Privacy Policy applies to use of the Opensignal (“
Opensignal
,” “
we
,” “
us
,” or “
our
”) mobile application and data we collect through, mobile applications operated by one of our partners (each, a “Partner”) who has implemented our Software Development Kit, or “
SDK
.”
The purpose of this Policy is to inform you about our privacy practices and to ensure that you understand the purposes for which we collect and process personal data, how we look after your personal data, and inform you of your privacy rights.
1. WHO WE ARE
Opensignal works with the global telecom ecosystem to help it understand and improve network speeds and network coverage for consumers like you. We provide application performance analytics and connectivity insights to our Partners while helping companies optimize networks in the areas that need it most. Opensignal takes great pride in providing a service that benefits many as we work toward our vision of advancing connectivity for all.
When you opt-in to allowing Opensignal to collect network performance readings from your device, we work with our Partners and companies in the telecom ecosystem to provide you with a better network and application experience. We rely on your choice and consent to initiate any transfer of data (and you can withdraw consent and opt-out at any time through the application). Our mobile application Partners support us entering into this relationship with you by facilitating our disclosure and consent process. We do not collect anything that directly identifies you or your mobile handset. We aggregate or depersonalize all data prior to sharing with our customers.
This Privacy Policy describes how we, Opensignal, collect, use, and share the data that you consent for us to collect, including personal data, when you opt in to allow us access to data in connection with the network performance experienced through a mobile application operated by one of our Partners.
As a company whose livelihood depends on data and its proper treatment, Opensignal takes data privacy and security very seriously. As such we have taken steps to go well beyond basic privacy and data protection requirements.
We request your consent to collect information relating to the network performance your device experiences, which may include certain types of personal data described below, in order to measure the performance, availability and/or signal quality of communication networks (the “
Opensignal Services
”).
Opensignal is the controller or joint controller and, as applicable, is responsible for the collection, control and processing of personal data that we collect from your device. If you have any questions or concerns about Opensignal’s use of your personal data, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.
IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS AS A RESIDENT OF COLORADO, CONNECTICUT, OR VIRGINIA, PLEASE SEE YOUR DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS IN SECTION 9. IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT, PLEASE SEE THE CCPA SUPPLEMENT BELOW IN SECTION 10. IF YOU HAVE RIGHTS AS A RESIDENT OF NEVADA, PLEASE SEE YOUR NEVADA PRIVACY RIGHTS IN SECTION 11.
2. MOBILE APPLICATIONS
At Opensignal, we use mobile network experience measurements to publish independent reports and insights on the real-world mobile network experience of everyday users worldwide. We obtain the relevant data by collecting measurements relating to signal reception and quality from mobile devices. The Opensignal mobile application and our Partner’s mobile applications (each, a “Mobile Application”) enable us to request your consent to our data collection. If you consent to initiate our collection of data, we may collect data from your mobile device when you are using a Mobile Application and/or when it is running in the background pertaining to network and wireless device experience.
WHAT DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT AND USE THAT DATA
The different kinds of personal data we may collect includes location data, device data and usage data as described further below.
The purpose of collecting limited device data is to measure the experience that devices have on wireless networks. If consent has been granted, we take measurements from devices from time to time including location data (which include GPS coordinates or similar information regarding the location of a network reading taken from your device), network type, network operator, cellular and Wifi signal strength and quality, IP address, and the identifiers of connected cell towers and Wifi routers (including both BSSID and SSID). Location readings are not tied to a device identifier such as a mobile handset MAC or IMEI, which we do not collect, and are instead the locations of network experience readings for purposes such as building general heatmaps of good and poor performance. We measure the performance of the data connection including the speed, responsiveness and reliability along with the total amount of data transferred. We collect crash logs data and diagnostics to ensure that our software does not negatively impact consumer experiences.
We collect information from environmental sensors on devices (depending on which ones are integrated in the device), which allows us to measure things such as the device acceleration, orientation and the external atmospheric pressure and light intensity. We also measure some internal device conditions – such as battery temperature and voltage. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how instantaneous device conditions may affect the experience of wireless networks. To better understand differences between devices, we collect data on device hardware such as the model, manufacturer, and manufacturers and models of sub-components (such as the cellular radio) and the capabilities of these components (for example the number of cores on the CPU). Similarly, to understand differences caused by software, we collect information on the mobile platform version used and whether custom ROMs or Android skins are installed, as well as the operating system. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how device properties affect the experience of wireless networks.
When a Mobile Application containing our SDK is installed and consent is provided, an identification code (“Resettable ID”) is randomly generated by our software and allocated to that installation instance rather than the device when we take measurements. A different and unique Resettable ID will be generated by each Mobile Application on a particular device. New installations of the same Mobile Application will also generate new unique Resettable IDs. Resettable IDs are random, unrelated to each other, specific to Opensignal, and not shared externally. To further help us manage the data, we also collect IP addresses, as these may indicate which telecom carrier network is being accessed and is impacting your experience. This document does not encompass or detail Opensignal's handling of internal employee or customer data. Opensignal's employees and customers may provide personal information through the regular course of business and Opensignal separately handles the governance of that data.
We prevent user identification; we do not collect name, email address, phone number, social media ID, contact list, Mobile Advertising ID, mobile handset MAC/IMEI, or anything else which directly identifies an individual or their specific device. For the avoidance of doubt, we also do not collect any special categories of personal data about you as defined in GDPR. We aggregate or depersonalize all data prior to sharing with our customers.
THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE YOUR DATA
The purposes for which we collect, store, and then aggregate or depersonalize personal data for external use are the following:
We do not use the measurements we take from mobile devices for any individualized user identification or individualized user tracking. Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users allow us to measure the performance of a carrier and the service availability, quality and performance of numerous communication networks across the world and over time. For example, we use data to improve wireless networks, research market performance, identify aggregate trends in device and network utilization patterns, understand the network-based drivers of subscriber churn and acquisition, and design effective network performance communication campaigns. Furthermore, we use data for the purpose of providing aggregated telecommunications network flow share, market share and other market analysis, using proprietary algorithms generating observations of market behavior, activations and deactivations across the telecom infrastructure. We publish some of the aggregated or depersonalized statistical data that we generate and we provide it to our customers (such as network operators) to help them understand, communicate and optimize their own network’s service coverage, performance and signal quality (and those of their competitors). We also create aggregated or depersonalized information.
We use data to test, monitor, improve or upgrade the Mobile Applications or SDKs, to meet our legal obligations and the regulatory requirements to which we may be subject, for loss prevention purposes and to protect and enforce our rights and meet our obligations to third parties, and for our internal business purposes, such as compiling and analyzing usage information for general operational, statistical and business purposes.
Our Customers and Partners are not permitted to use our data to identify the mobile applications or publishers that our data has been received from. We collect data from various mobile applications, and our reports, data, and documentation do not reveal which mobile applications the source data was collected from. We do not publicly disclose our Partners without their permission.
3. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR DATA
We collect and process personal data based on your express consent. If consent is provided, it can be withdrawn via measures provided by the Mobile Application, such as through the personal settings menu in the Mobile Application (but that will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent). In respect of any personal data collected from devices with your consent we also rely on our legitimate interest in conducting our business and in carrying out statistical and scientific research work and in providing analytical data to our clients and improving global connectivity for users like you.
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
Opensignal participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. Opensignal’s identification number within the framework is 1263.
4. HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION
Service Providers. We may share datasets containing personal data as part of private contracts we have with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf in connection with the Opensignal Services, such as cloud service providers for storage and the processing required for depersonalization. Where this information is shared with such third parties, we obligate the third-party service provider to manage the information only on our behalf and solely for our benefit (and not for its own benefit).
Business Change. If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction, or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer databases containing personal data to successor party or parties in connection with such transaction or change in ownership or legal structure.
Necessary Disclosure. Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the Opensignal Services; (ii) comply with laws, subpoenas, warrants, court orders, legal processes or requests of government or law enforcement officials; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety or property, or that of our users or others; (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding known or suspected illegal activities; fraud; our rights, reputation, safety or property, or those of our users or others; violation of the Terms of Use, our policies or agreements; or as otherwise required by law.
Subsidiaries and affiliates. We may share the data that we collect from users’ mobile devices with the Opensignal subsidiaries and affiliates, with the purpose of bringing together complementary data on consumer experience, network performance, and subscriber behavior.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
5. HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
We take appropriate measures to protect personal data collected through the Opensignal Services against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, destruction or modification. These include physical, technological, contractual, and administrative measures.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, accurate, complete, or current. Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.
6. HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION
Any personal data which may be contained in the sets of measurements of mobile network signal performance described above is only retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of personal data, the purposes for which we process personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
7. COUNTRY OF PROCESSING
We operate globally. The collection of data from devices takes place in the country where the device is used. We store and otherwise process data (including personal data) through third party cloud service providers who offer a range of global storage location options. We store personal data records predominantly through third-party cloud service providers on servers located in the United States of America. When transferring personal data records to a country which does not provide an adequate level of protection to privacy rights, we put in place appropriate safeguards including data transfer agreements.
8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
The Opensignal Service is not directed to children and is intended for use by adults only. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal data from individuals under 18 years of age. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any information through the Opensignal Service and do not provide your consent for the use of your data.
9. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
Data subjects may have the following legal rights depending on applicable law in respect of their personal data that we process:
The right to require Opensignal to confirm whether or not your information is being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any information that has been disclosed, the period for which your information is to be stored and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in relation to your information;
The right to require access to the personal data and to require Opensignal to rectify inaccurate information;
Where Opensignal has relied on the ‘consent’ basis for processing that information, the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This right to withdraw consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
The right to request the erasure of their information. You can make a request for erasure where:
the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected;
where the processing of the information is based on your consent (and the other circumstances described in the ‘Legal Basis for Processing Your Data’ and ‘How We Share Personal Information’ sections above no longer apply), if you withdraw your consent; or
where the personal data is processed by Opensignal solely on the basis of our ‘legitimate interest’, if you withdraw your consent for the processing of your data and you object to the processing of your personal data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing (such as, for example, the achievement of the purpose of using your data for statistical or scientific research purposes or where the processing of the data is required to meet statutory obligations or for the defense of legal claims).
Where Opensignal has disclosed your information of a data subject to a third party and you request the erasure or rectification of the data, Opensignal will take any steps required under relevant laws to inform the third party of such request.
The right to require Opensignal to restrict its processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that data is disputed or an objection has been raised. In such circumstances, Opensignal will only process that information with your express consent, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest;
Where data is processed based on your consent or to fulfill a contractual obligation provided for by law, you have the right to receive your personal data from Opensignal in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
The right to object to the processing of personal data where:
a.Opensignal relies solely on the ‘legitimate interest’ basis for processing that data, in which case we will be legally required to stop processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your privacy rights and interests; or
b.the information is used for direct marketing purposes, in which case we will immediately stop processing your information for such purposes.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (www.ico.org.uk) or in some cases with the data protection supervisory authority or regulator of the jurisdiction where you reside. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the authority or regulator, so please contact us in the first instance.
You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us to another organization, or to you, in certain circumstances.
The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or would seriously impair their attainment. In addition, there are, consistent with relevant laws, limitations on our ability to honor requests to exercise these rights for data that cannot be linked to a verified request, such as where data has been de-personalized.
To exercise these rights, please call us at (+44) 020 3289 3375 or email us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.   You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to appeal a refusal to take action on your request; to do so, please see any applicable instructions in our response to your request. We will aim to respond to any request within one month. Please note that we cannot fulfill requests to know the specific pieces of personal information that we may have collected about you. In order to disclose the specific pieces of personal information that we may have collected about you, we would have to verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty. Given the limited amount of information that we collect about you, we do not maintain enough data points to verify your identity to the reasonably high degree of certainty required by relevant law.
Our data processing activities do not include the sale of personal data, the use of personal data for targeting advertising, or the use of personal data for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, although we may disclose aggregated or depersonalized data with external sources, as described above. As a result, we do not honor rights to opt out of these practices in jurisdictions that recognize such rights.
You can also authorize another person, called an agent, to exercise your rights on your behalf. You must provide the authorized agent written and signed permission to act on your behalf. We may deny requests from an authorized agent who does not submit proof that he or she has been authorized to act on your behalf. Furthermore, we may require you to verify your identity directly with us. We may also require you to directly confirm with us that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit a request on your behalf. An authorized agent can make a request on your behalf by either calling us at (+44) 020 3289 3375 or by emailing us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.
We may not discriminate against you because you exercised any of your data subject rights, although some of the functionality and features available on the service may change or no longer be available to you. Any differences in the services are related to the value provided.
10. SUPPLEMENT FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
You will not need to create an account to exercise your rights. California residents have the right to:
Delete. To exercise this right, you must provide a verifiable consumer request by either calling us at (+44) 020 3289 or by emailing us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.
Know. You may request that, for personal information we disclose, we provide you the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting personal information, if applicable, the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information. To exercise this right, you must provide a verifiable consumer request by either calling us at (+44) 020 3289 3375 or by emailing us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.
Access. You may request that, for personal information we disclose, the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, the categories of personal information that we have disclosed about you for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom each category of personal information was disclosed. To exercise this right, you must provide a verifiable consumer request by either calling us at (+44) 020 3289 3375, or by emailing us at
privacy@opensignal.com
.
Opt out of sale. We do not sell your personal information within the meaning of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“
CCPA
”). Under the CCPA, “sell” means sell, rent, release, disclose, disseminate, make available, transfer, or otherwise communicate orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. The law contains exceptions to this definition which may limit how we respond to a request by you. To exercise this right to opt out, you may call us at (+44) 020 3289 3375 or email us at
privacy@opensignal.com
. We do not have actual knowledge that we sell the personal information of minors under 18 years of age, and minors under the age of 18 may not use the Opensignal Services.
In addition, there are, consistent with relevant laws, limitations on our ability to honor requests to exercise these rights for data that cannot be linked to a verified request, such as where data has been depersonalized, or whether there are other relevant exceptions under California law.
We do not provide a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information, because in the event that we collect certain sensitive personal information, we do not use it to infer characteristics such that we would be required to provide a right to limit.
To the extent that anything in this Section 10 conflicts with this Privacy Policy, this Section 10 shall govern.
The categories of California consumers’ personal data we may have collected are listed above in the Section – HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR DATA. We may disclose the following categories of data to our customers, although personal information is aggregated or depersonalized before it is shared: (1) Location, (2) Identifiers such as IP address, and (3) Internet or other electronic network activity information, all of which we have collected from your mobile device. We may collect the categories we’ve previously identified (which include GPS coordinates or similar information), network type, network operator, cellular and Wifi signal strength and quality, and the identifiers of connected cell towers and Wifi routers (including both BSSID and SSID). We also measure how data is flowing, both passively (by monitoring how fast it moves through other Mobile Applications), and actively (by running a test that downloads or uploads data within our SDK). We do not monitor the content of your data usage. The goal of collecting the above data is to measure the experience you have of wireless networks. We also collect information from environmental sensors on your device (depending on which ones are integrated in your device), this allows us to measure things such as the device acceleration, orientation and the external atmospheric pressure and light intensity. We also measure some internal device conditions – such as battery temperature and voltage. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how instantaneous device conditions affect the experience of wireless networks.
To better understand differences between devices, we collect data on your device hardware such as the model, manufacturer, and manufacturers and models of sub-components (such as the cellular radio) and the capabilities of these components (for example the number of cores on the CPU). Similarly, to understand differences caused by software, we collect information on the mobile platform version used and whether custom ROMs or Android skins are installed. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how device properties affect the experience of wireless networks.
When you first use a Mobile Application an identification code (“Resettable ID”), is randomly generated by our software and allocated to that installation instance rather than the device whenever we take measurements. A different and unique Resettable ID will be generated by each Mobile Application on a particular device. New installations of the same Mobile Application will also generate new unique Resettable IDs. Resettable IDs are random, unrelated to each other, specific to Opensignal, and not shared externally. To further help us manage the data, we also collect IP addresses, as these may indicate which telecom carrier network is being accessed and is impacting your experience.
We use this data for the purposes listed above in the Section – THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE YOUR DATA. Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users allow us to create a detailed picture of the service availability, quality and performance of numerous communication networks across the world and over time.
We may have shared certain categories of personal data listed in the Section - HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR DATA to the third parties listed in the Section - HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION for a business purpose and in order to provide the Opensignal Services. We may have shared the following categories of personal information: (1) Location, (2) Identifiers, such as IP addresses, and (3) Internet or other electronic network activity information, all of which we have collected from your mobile device. We may have shared the following categories of personal data with the following third parties or may do so in the following instances:
Service Providers
.
We may share datasets containing personal data with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf in connection with the Opensignal Services, such as cloud service providers for storage and the processing required for depersonalization. Where this information is shared with such third parties, we obligate the third-party service provider to manage the information only on our behalf, and on our written instructions and solely for our benefit (and not for its own benefit).
Business Change
.
If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction, or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer databases containing personal data to successor party or parties in connection with such transaction or change in ownership or legal structure.
Necessary Disclosure
.
Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the Opensignal Services; (ii) comply with laws, subpoenas, warrants, court orders, legal processes or requests of government or law enforcement officials; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety or property, or that of our users or others; (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding known or suspected illegal activities; fraud; our rights, reputation, safety or property, or those of our users or others; violation of the Terms of Use, our policies or agreements; or as otherwise required by law.
Subsidiaries and affiliates
.
We may share the data that we collect from users’ mobile devices with the Opensignal subsidiaries and affiliates, with the purpose of bringing together complementary data on consumer experience, network performance, and subscriber behavior.
Shine the Light Notice

” or “
we
”) collects, stores, uses and discloses information about individuals who use mobile apps developed and operated by third parties  from which Placer receives certain information and data (such individuals are referred to herein as “
Consumers
'').
WHO ARE “YOU”?
‍
We refer to “you” a lot in this Privacy Policy.  As used in this Privacy Policy, “you” refers to Consumers (as defined above).
We have a separate privacy policy relating to Placer Customers.  “
Placer Customers
” means direct users of our Platform Services, and “
Platform Services
” means (i) the website located at http://placer.ai (the “
Site
”) and (ii) any services, features, and content downloadable or accessible from the Site.  Categories of Placer Customers may include, among others, (a) developers and operators of mobile apps that have integrated Placer’s technology and (b) users of our data analytics.  Placer Customers may be retail stores, restaurants, brands, researchers, and advertising agencies, just to name a few examples.  Users of the Site are also Placer Customers.  If you are a Placer Customer, please refer to that privacy policy at
https://www.placer.ai/privacy-policy/platform-services-privacy-policy/
.
HOW DOES PLACER WORK?
‍
Placer’s technology is deployed in many mobile apps and millions of devices. Placer’s technology collects data, such as geolocation data, which is scrubbed of any identifiers such as MAIDs before being sent to Placer to protect the privacy of Consumers. Using aggregated data, Placer provides data analytics and actionable insights to Placer Customers. Such data analytics and actionable insights may include foot traffic patterns and Consumer preferences, among many other examples.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
‍
3.1
From Consumers
‍
If you are a Consumer, we may collect information relating to you such as geolocation and proximity data (if you have enabled your device to disclose location information), time and date information, and dwell time near points of interest, as determined through beacon, Wi-Fi, and other signals per our proprietary systems. Generally, the information we collect is not information that identifies you personally. We receive such data from third-party mobile apps that have integrated our technology. We rely upon the developer and operator of these mobile apps to enable you to provide or withdraw consent with respect to the collection and use of your information. You may also control your mobile device directly by enabling or disabling the applicable settings, such as your location settings.
‍
3.2
Note about Personally Identifiable Information
‍
The data we receive from third-party mobile apps is stripped of identifiers, such as mobile advertising identifiers, names, other persistent device identifiers, and contact information associated with Consumers (hereinafter “User Identifiers”). We intentionally built our Platform Services to produce aggregated market research reports without relying on such User Identifiers.
Where the data we receive has been deidentified, we maintain and use that information only in a deidentified form and will not attempt to re identify the deidentified data.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
‍
Generally, to provide our Platform Services, we use our proprietary technology to analyze and process the location data collected (free of User Identifiers). We then aggregate that location data and extrapolate the aggregated results so they can be used in our Platform. We then use the extrapolated information (i.e., information not associated with an individual Consumer) to provide certain features of the Platform Services, including, without limitation, the following:
‍
4.a  To provide Placer Customers with visibility into aggregate Consumer foot-traffic;
4.b  To provide Placer Customers with insight into different venues and places;
4.c  To analyze aggregate Consumer preferences.In addition, we use the information collected for our internal business purposes, including, without limitation:
4.d  To operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all features of our services;
4.e.  To improve our services, and to develop new products, services, features, and functionality.
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
‍
We do not disclose User Identifiers to any third parties because we do not collect any User Identifiers associated with Consumers. We also do not sell any data about individual Consumers to anyone, nor do we otherwise disclose any data about individual Consumers with anyone except in the limited circumstances described below. As described above, we disclose only aggregated statistical information with Placer Customers to provide the Platform Services. We may also disclose information (including information about individual Consumers) under the following circumstances:
‍
5.a  To Service Providers. We work with service providers to provide application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services for us. We may transfer, and these service providers may have access to or process, information about you as part of providing those services for us. Generally, we limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
5.b  To Comply with Laws. We may disclose information about you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with laws, in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.
5.c  To Protect Our Legal Rights.  We also reserve the right to disclose information about you that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to: (i) take precautions against liability; (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of our services and any facilities or equipment used to make our services available; or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.
5.d.  In Corporate Reorganizations. Information may be disclosed during due diligence or in preparation for or after an acquisition or merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, financing, reorganization or similar corporate transactions with requirements for the receiving party to maintain the confidentiality of such information, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.  The use of your information following any of these events will be governed by the provisions of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time the applicable information was collected.
5.e  With Your Consent. We may also disclose your information with your permission.
RETENTION
‍
When we collect Personal Data, we keep it for as long as we need it for the purpose for which it is being  processed.  For example, we will retain such information for as long as our services are active  or as needed to provide our services to you.  After that, we will keep the Personal Data for a period  which enables us to handle or respond to any complaints, queries or concerns relating to your use of our  services.  We will periodically review the Personal Data we hold and delete it securely when there is no longer a legal, business, or consumer  need for it to be retained.
YOUR CHOICES
‍
You may, of course, decline to disclose certain information to us.
If you wish to access or amend any information we hold about you, you may contact us at privacy@placer.ai. Please note, however, that because we intentionally do not collect User Identifiers, it is very unlikely that we will be able to associate any information in our systems with you directly. If we are able to locate and associate information in our systems with you, please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in our databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
THIRD PARTY SERVICES

Our services may be integrated with, or contain features or links to, mobile apps and services provided by third parties.  Any information you provide on third-party mobile apps and services is provided directly to the operators of such mobile apps and services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security.  We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties.  We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.
DATA SECURITY
‍
We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of information that we collect and maintain.  Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  We cannot and do not guarantee that information about you will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
‍
Our services are not directed to children under the age of 18.  We do not knowingly collect any information at all from children under the age of 18.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
‍
We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. laws, please note that you are transferring information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

You may update, correct, or delete your Personal Data and preferences at any time by request to us.  Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
You may decline to disclose certain Personal Data to us, in which case the third-party mobile app you use may not be able to provide you with some features or functionality.
At any time, you may object to the processing of your Personal Data, on legitimate grounds, except if otherwise permitted by applicable law.  If you believe your right to privacy granted by applicable data protection laws has been infringed upon, please contact us as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section in the Privacy Policy.  You also have a right to lodge a complaint with data protection authorities.

Rights under the CCPA
Access to Specific Information; Deletion; Correction
‍
If you are a California resident, you have the right to:
Request that we disclose to you the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:
the categories of personal information that we have collected about you;
the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting personal information about you;
the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed personal information about you, the categories of personal information that was disclosed, and the purpose for disclosing the personal information about you (if we have made any such disclosures); and
the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you; and
Request that we delete personal information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception.
Request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.
Exercising Your Rights
‍
To request access to your personal information or request deletion, please submit a verifiable request through one of the following methods:
Email:
privacy@placer.ai
; or
Toll-free number:
+1 (888) 383 3424
Only you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a consumer request related to your personal information.
You may only request a copy of your data twice within any 12-month period.  The request must:
Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and
Describe your request with sufficient details to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. As noted above in our Privacy Policy, however, because we intentionally do not collect User Identifiers, it is very unlikely that we will be able to verify your identity and locate any personal information related to you.  We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
‍
Our goal is to respond to a verifiable request within 45 days of its receipt.  If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the request unless you request that we provide your personal information beyond the 12-month period.  If applicable, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with the request.  We will provide your personal information in a format that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information without hindrance. We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive or repetitive.  If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will provide you with the basis for that decision and a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA.  Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not, because of your exercise of such rights:
Deny you goods or services;
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
