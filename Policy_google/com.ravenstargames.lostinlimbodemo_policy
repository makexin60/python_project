Some doors shall never be opened. Some paths are never meant to be walked.
And yet,
you
shall walk them for my sake, my wanderer.
You can only run away from fate for so long.
Torn away from your peaceful life and thrown into a world of danger and deceit, you are at the mercy of the Seven Sovereigns of Limbo, almighty gods that have sworn to be your protectors...as long as you prove yourself useful.
Will love be the key to your freedom, or the first chapter of your downfall?
Follow us on social media for updates!
Which of the Seven Sovereigns will be in charge of your life is up to fate, but whether you fall in love or in disgrace... is up to
you.
AMON
he/him - 34 yo - 2.15m (7'1'')
<<I wanna share everything this town has to offer with you, if you lemme show you. I promise I'll be by your side to keep you safe.>>
Lord Amon lives his life to the fullest, even if it means dragging you into the flamboyant chaos of the city he rules over.
Does he have any ulterior motive to deny you his help, or is he just a bit of an idiot?
RAEYA
she/her - 32 yo - 1.88m (6'2'')
<<This world will do anything to bring you to your knees, human. If you want to survive, you better learn how to get back up quickly.>>
Praefectus Raeya earned her title as Limbo’s protector through determination and perseverance.
When her family’s safety is threatened and both your paths intertwine, what will you be willing to sacrifice to save what you love the most?
GAEL
he/him - 29 yo - 1.93m (6'4'')
<<I would like you to trust me. Even if we are only pretending, I wouldn't want our arrangement to cause you any pain.>>
Master of the Grand Houses, behind Gael’s sweet persona lies a secret that will push your faith in him to the limit.
For how long can you keep your end of the bargain and pretend to be in love to save your life?
ENVY
he/they - 24 yo - 1.74m (5'8'')
<<It doesn't matter if what they say about me is true or not. What matter is: is it worth risking your life to find out?>>
Stripped of their name and shunned after commiting treason, the Sovereign now known as Lord Envy lives a life of solitude.
Can you break the walls they have built around themselves for centuries, or will you remain a prisoner in his castle for all eternity?
ARA
she/her - 22 yo - 1.64m (5'4'')
<<No matter how many worlds are between us, I will remember you. The memories we've made together will always be important to me.>>
Kind and caring, Ara is ready to make your time in Limbo a good thing to remember no matter what.
And yet, soon enough you find out about the darkness lurking near and realize her life may be in danger—and consequently, yours too.
XAL
he/him - 21 yo - 1.70m (5'7'')
<<No one in this realm cares. About you, about me, about anything. So maybe we could just...care about each other, instead.>>
As the youngest of the Sovereigns, no one expects anything from Xal, not even himself.
However, under that mask of indifference hides a gentle soul desperate for someone to believe in him—if you can make your way into his heart.
FATHER PRIDE
he/him - 52 yo - 1.80m (5'11'')
<<As brief as our time together may be, you have changed this timeless life of mine more than I could have ever dreamed of.>>
God and creator of Limbo, Father Pride watches over the peace and well-being of his realm.
The life of a god can be solitary, though. When he welcomes you with open arms, his kindness draws you in...and a perturbing omen makes you stay.
