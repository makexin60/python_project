How We Use the Information We Collect
3.1 We use the information that we collect in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following:
(i) General Use.
We use Personal Data and other information collected through the Service to (a) register the User with the Website and create his/her Personal Account, (b) provide the User with the requested services (mainly to process and confirm the User’s reservation with the accommodation provider or other supplier) (c) provide the User with information about our services on the Website or on other websites and to communicate with the User (including by post-booking chat support) to the extent necessary to provide such requested services, (d) build features that will make the services available on the Website easier to use, (e) conduct surveys, (f) for an improved user experience, internal training and general optimization purposes, (g) for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities or (h) contact the User in case there is any issue with his/her Booking. This includes faster purchase requests, better customer support and timely notice of new services and special offers.
(ii) Operations.
We use the information to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Service, to provide the services and information that the User requests, to respond to comments and questions, to resolve any incidents and to provide support to the User of the Service.
(iii) Improvements.
We use the information to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the Service, and to develop new products, services, feature, and functionality. Should this purpose require Zenhotels to process Personal Data, then the data will only be used in anonymized or aggregated form.
(iv) Marketing Activities & Reminders:
We also use the User’s information for marketing activities, as permitted by law. For example: when the User makes a Booking with us, set up a Personal Account, complete or enter details into a booking form, or provide us with his/her contact details we may use the User’s contact information to send the User news of products and services relevant and useful for travelers. With the User’s consent – if consent is required under local law – we may also send the User other regular newsletters by email. The User can opt out, or unsubscribe, from marketing communications at any time using the “Unsubscribe”. Based on the information the User shares with us, individualized offers may be shown to him/her on the Website, in mobile apps or on third-party websites, including social media sites. These might be offers that the User can book directly on the Website, or third-party offers or products we think the User might find interesting.
If the User has not finalized a booking online, we may send the User a reminder to continue with his/her booking. We believe that this additional service is useful to the User because it allows the User to carry on with a booking without having to search for the travel services again or fill in all the booking details from scratch.
When the User participates in other promotional activities, including but not limited to our referral programs, relevant information will be used to administer these promotions.
Please note that the confirmation emails and text messages sent after the Booking completion, as well as the guest review emails sent after the User’s departure, are not marketing messages. These messages are part of the Booking process. Respectively, they contain information to check in at the User’s booked services, and tools to optionally rate that services after the use of them. The User will continue to receive them, even if he/she has opted out of our marketing messages.
We may use the User’s email address or other information to contact that User and responding to and handling any requests he/she have made or with updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with.
(v) Cookies and tracking technologies.
We use automatically collected information and other information collected on the Service through cookies and similar technologies to: (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering the User’s information so that the User will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent visits; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Service and third-party marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (v) track the User’s entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities on the Service. The User can obtain more information about cookies by visiting

We take measures to protect the technical information collected by our use of Google Analytics. The data collected will only be used on a need to know basis to resolve technical issues, administer the Website and identify the User preferences; but in this case, the data will be in non-identifiable form. We do not use any of this information to identify Users.

(i) Performance of a contract:
The use of the User’s Personal Data is necessary to perform the contract that the User has with us. When the User uses our services to make a Booking, we will use the User’s Personal Data to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that Booking in accordance with the accepted Bookings terms and Conditions.
(ii) Legitimate interests:
We may use the User’s Personal data for our legitimate interests, such as to provide the User with the best suitable content of the Website, emails and newsletters, to improve and promote our products and services and the content on the Website, and for administrative, fraud detection and legal purposes.

To Whom We Disclose Information
4.1 Except as described in this Policy, we will not intentionally disclose the Personal Data that we collect or store on the Service to third parties without the consent of the applicable User. We may disclose information to third parties if the User consents to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
Providers of travel services that the User’s booked.
In order to complete the Booking, we transfer relevant reservation details to third parties which travel services the User has booked on the Website. This may include name, surname, passport details, residency, contact details, payment details, the names of guests travelling with the User and any preferences the User specified when the User made the Booking. If the User has a query about his/her Booking, we may contact service providers and ask them to handle such request. Unless payment is made during the book process via the Service, we will forward the User’s credit card details to an appropriate service provider for further handling (assuming the User has provided us with those details during his/her booking process). In cases of reservation-related disputes, we may provide the service provider with information about the booking process as needed. This may include a copy of the reservation confirmation as proof that the Booking was actually made.
Third-party Personal Data processor.
We may use service providers to process Personal Data on our behalf. This processing is for several purposes, including for example sending out marketing material. Third party service providers are bound by confidentiality clauses and are not allowed to use Personal Data for other purposes.
Payment providers and (other) financial institutions.
When a chargeback is requested for the Booking by either the User or by the holder of the credit card used to make the Booking, we may need to share certain booking details with the payment service provider and the relevant financial institution to handle the chargeback. This may also include a copy of the reservation confirmation or the IP address used to make the Booking. We may furthermore share information with relevant financial institutions, if we consider it strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention purposes.
Competent authorities.
We disclose Personal Data to law enforcement insofar as it is required by law or is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud. We may need to further disclose Personal Data to competent authorities to protect and defend our rights or properties, or the rights and properties of our business partners.
Business partners.
We work with many business partners around the world. Some of these business partners distribute or advertise our services, as well as help our other business partners distribute and advertise their own travel-related services. This may mean that their services are integrated into our website/apps, they have been enabled to show the User a customized advertisement, or Zenhotels online reservation services are integrated in their websites and/or apps.
When the User makes a reservation on one of our business partners’ websites or apps, certain personal data that the User gives them will be forwarded to us. If customer service is provided by the business partner, Zenhotels will share details relevant to the Booking with the business partners (as and when needed) in order to provide the User with appropriate and efficient support. When the User makes a booking through one of our business partners’ websites, the business partners may receive certain parts of Personal Data related to the specific booking. This is for their own internal purposes (such as analytical purposes) and, if requested by the User, for the administration of loyalty programs or marketing.
When the User makes a booking on a business partners’ website, the User should also take the time to read their privacy policies if the User wishes to understand how these business partners may process Personal Data. When we offer the User travel-related products and/or services, the User’s information may be shared with the offering business partners to handle or administer his/her order. For fraud detection and prevention purposes and as strictly necessary, we may also exchange information about our Users with business partners.
Advertising partners.
As a way of marketing Zenhotels services via third party business partners (to ensure relevant advertisements are shown to the right audience), we may share personal data with advertising partners. This includes an email address. We strive to only share email addresses in a hashed form so they can be matched to an existing customer database. We strive not to share email addresses for any other purpose. For more information, please read sections
“More on Cookies”
and
“The User’s choices”

We limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and our contracts with them require them to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

We may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our Users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, and/or functionality available through the Service.

Interest Based Advertising
Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual’s preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.
We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in Zenhotels products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.
These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person’s interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.
In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on the Websites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.
The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties’ platforms.
We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, the Website visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads the User is shown we can try not to show him/her the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person’s perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.

More on Cookies
7.1 A cookie is a small amount of data that is placed in the browser of the User’s computer or on his/her mobile device. So-called “first party cookies” (not as much fun as they sound) are cookies which are served by the entity operating the domain through which the cookie is served. Zenhotels’ own cookies are therefore “first party cookies”. In case we allow others to service cookies through the Service, these cookies are so-called “third party cookies”.
In addition, there is a difference between session cookies and permanent cookies. Session cookies will only exist until the User closes his/her browser. Permanent cookies have a longer lifespan and are not automatically deleted once the User closes the browser. We strive to serve cookies or allow the serving of cookies with a maximum lifespan of 5 years. Only in exceptional circumstances, such as for security purposes and where absolutely necessary, will a cookie have a longer lifespan than that.
Next to cookies, other tracking technologies are used which are similar to cookies. These can include web beacons (also known as pixel tags, web bugs or gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs). A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that can be delivered to the User’s computer as part of a web page request, in an app, in an advertisement or in an HTML email message. Pixels can be used to retrieve information from the User’s device, such as the device type or operating system, IP address, and time of visit. They are also used to serve and read cookies in the browser. Tracking URLs are used to understand from which referring website the Service is used. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons. All these technologies are hereinafter together referred to in this section as
“Cookies”
.
7.2 The Following Types of Cookies Are Used on the Website.
Technical Cookies.
We try to give our visitors an advanced, user-friendly website and apps that adapt automatically to their needs and wishes. To achieve this, we use Technical Cookies to show the User the Service, to make them function correctly, to create the User account, to sign the User in and to manage Bookings. These Technical Cookies are absolutely necessary for the Service to function properly.
Functional Cookies.
We also use Functional Cookies to remember the User’s preferences and to help the User to use the Service efficiently and effectively. For example, these Cookies remember the User’s preferred currency, language, the User’s searches and the User’s previously viewed travel services. We may also use Cookies to remember the User’s registration information so that the User doesn’t have to retype his/her login credentials each time he/she visits our site. The User’s password will, however, always be encrypted. These Functional Cookies are not strictly necessary for the functioning of the Service, but they add functionality and enhance user experience.
Analytics Cookies.
We use these Cookies to gain insight into how our visitors use the Service. This means we can find out what works and what doesn't, optimize and improve the Service, understand the effectiveness of advertisements and communications, and ensure we continue to be interesting and relevant. The data we gather can include which web pages the User has viewed, which referring/exit pages he/she has entered and left from, which platform type he/she has used, which emails the User has opened and acted upon, and date and time stamp information.
It also means we can use details about how the User has interacted with the Service, such as the number of clicks he/she makes on a given page, his/her mouse movements and scrolling activity, the search words he/she uses and the text he/she enters into various fields. We make use of Analytics Cookies as part of our online advertising campaigns to learn how Users interact with our website or apps after they have been shown an online advertisement. This may include advertisements on third-party websites. Analytics Cookies may also be used to enable our business partners to learn if their customers make use of offers integrated into their websites.
Commercial Cookies.
We use third-party cookies as well as our own to display personalized advertisements on our websites and on other websites. This is called “retargeting”, and it is based on browsing activities, such as the destinations the User has been searching for, the accommodation the User has viewed and the prices he/she has been shown.
7.3. Important information.
We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use Cookies and other technologies to collect information about the User’s use of the Service. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when the User views or interacts with one of their advertisements on the Website; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about the User’s interests when he/she views or interacts with one of their advertisements.
The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about the User’s interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on the Website and on other sites across the Internet tailored to the User’s apparent interests.
The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements have limited access to a small amount of information about the User’s profile and device, which is necessary to serve the User advertisements that are tailored to his/her apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.
We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify the User (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about the User’s device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about the User’s interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Policy. Other than as discussed in this Policy, we have no control over these third parties.

Data Security and Retention
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.
If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform the User and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.
In accordance with European data protection laws, we observe reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access to, and the misuse of, Personal Data. Only authorized personnel are permitted to access personal data in the course of their work.
We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User’s Personal Account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law.

Safeguarding your data
Laws protecting user privacy such as the
European Economic Area’s General Data Protection Regulation
and other privacy laws that establish various rights for applicable US-state residents impact content publishers, application developers, website visitors, and application users. See also
the Google privacy policy
and Google’s site for
customers and partners
. Currently such regulations apply to specific geographic regions, but publishers and application developers often implement controls that affect the experience of users in all regions.
Google is committed to protecting data confidentiality and security. It is important to understand your privacy options, whether in the role of a publisher or a consumer. This page provides information on data collection and security for:
Content publishers and app developers (“customers”) using Google measurement products.
Website visitors and app users (“users”) of sites and apps using Google measurement products.
Data collection
Google customers use tags on web pages and an SDK for mobile apps to enable Google measurement products. The measurement data collected helps customers understand their users’ needs and, optionally, personalize the user experience and offer relevant advertising (see
Advertising personalization
).
Google tags and the SDK use cookies and app instance IDs, respectively, to measure user interaction. While these identifiers provide information about user behavior, Google prohibits customers from sending
Personally Identifiable Information
to Google Analytics. Even so, use of cookies and app IDs falls under the privacy laws mentioned previously. Google customers need to inform users about the information being stored and give them the opportunity to grant or deny their consent.

Our privacy policy
At Google, we are keenly aware of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to keep your privacy and data secure. As part of this responsibility, we let you know what information we collect when you use our products and services, why we collect it, and how we use it to improve your experience. The
Google privacy policy & principles
describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including Google Analytics.
Google Analytics cookies and identifiers
Google Analytics mainly uses first-party cookies to report on visitor (aka. user) interactions on Google Analytics customers’ websites. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie.
Learn more
In addition, Google Analytics supports an optional browser
add-on
that - once installed and enabled - disables measurement by Google Analytics for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only disables Google Analytics measurement.
Where a site or app uses Google Analytics for Apps or the Google Analytics for Firebase SDKs, Google Analytics collects
an app-instance identifier
— a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App. Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset.
Where sites or apps have implemented Google Analytics with other Google Advertising products, like Google Ads, additional advertising identifiers may be collected. Users can opt-out of this feature and manage their settings for this cookie using the
Ads Settings
.

Google Analytics under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Google operates as a data processor for Google Analytics. This is reflected in our Ads Data Processing Terms, which are available to all Google Analytics customers with direct contracts with Google.
Learn more
Google Analytics is a data processor under GDPR because Google Analytics collects and processes data on behalf of our clients, pursuant to their instructions. Our customers are data controllers who retain full rights over the collection, access, retention, and deletion of their data at any time. Google’s use of data is controlled by the terms of its contract with Google Analytics customers and any settings enabled by customers through the user interface of our product.
Google Analytics under privacy laws in the United States
In order to help Google Analytics customers prepare for laws that establish various rights for applicable US-state residents, we have updated our
Data Processing Terms
to include a
U.S. State Privacy Laws Service Provider and Processor Addendum
. Subject to the full terms of this addendum, Google Analytics will act as a service provider to its customers (when data sharing with Google products and services is disabled) and as such, will only use data collected on behalf of the customer in Google Analytics to provide the Google Analytics services. Customers who have not accepted our
Data Processing Terms
can do so
per these instructions
. Customers who have already agreed to our
Data Processing Terms
will not need to take additional action to accept the CCPA service provider addendum. Customers should review the
U.S. State Privacy Laws Service Provider and Processor Addendum
, as well as Google Analytics’ use of data, to ensure it meets customer’s compliance needs.
To help customers manage their compliance needs, Google Analytics offers a collection of tools, detailed below, that enable you to control how data is collected, and whether it is used for advertising personalization.
If you have linked Google Analytics to another product, please refer to

Data Collected by Google Analytics
First-party cookies
Google Analytics collects first-party cookies, data related to the device/browser, IP address (when collecting data, Google Analytics 4 does not log or store IP addresses), and on-site/app activities to measure and report statistics about user interactions on the websites and/or apps that use Google Analytics. Customers may customize cookies and the data collected with features like
cookie settings
,
User-ID
,
Data Import
, and
Measurement Protocol
.
Learn more
Google Analytics customers who have for instance, enabled the analytics.js or gtag.js collection method can control whether or not they use cookies to store a pseudonymous or random client identifier. If the customer decides to set a cookie, the information stored in the local first-party cookie is reduced to a random identifier (e.g., 12345.67890).
For customers who use the Google Analytics for Apps SDK, we collect an App Instance Identifier, which is a number that is randomly generated when the user installs an app for the first time.
Advertising identifiers
Where customers use
Google Analytics Advertising Features
, Google advertising cookies are collected and used to enable features like Remarketing on the Google Display Network. These features are subject to the users’
Ads Settings
, the
Policy requirements for Google Analytics Advertising Features
and
Google’s EU User Consent policy
, which requires customers to obtain consent for cookies where legally required—including consent for personalized ads. For more information about how Google uses advertising cookies, visit the
Google Advertising Privacy FAQ
. It is possible to implement Google Analytics without affecting normal data collection where Advertising features are disabled until consent is obtained (see
Privacy Controls in Google Analytics
), as well as prevent certain data from being used for advertising personalization purposes (See
Advertising Personalization below
).
PII prohibition
Our contracts prohibit customers from sending
Personally Identifiable Information
to Google Analytics. Customers should follow these
Best Practices
to ensure PII is not sent to Google Analytics.
What is the data used for?
Google uses Google Analytics data to provide the Google Analytics measurement service to customers. Identifiers such as cookies and app instance IDs are used to measure user interactions with a customer’s sites and/or apps, while IP addresses are used to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give the customer a sense of where in the world their users come from. Customers may also choose to use the data collected by Google Analytics for site/app personalization or advertising purposes, including ads personalization (See
Advertising Personalization below
).
Data access
We do not share Google Analytics data without the customer’s authorization (including via settings in the product user interface), or as otherwise expressly permitted under the terms of their Google Analytics agreement, except in limited circumstances when required by law.
Customers may control their own access to data in their Analytics accounts or properties by configuring view and edit permissions for employees or other representatives who may login to their Analytics account.
Learn more
Security-dedicated engineering teams at Google guard against external threats to data. Internal access to data (e.g., by employees) is limited by strict access controls (both internal policy controls and automated technical controls such as authentication, SSL, and security logs) to only those with a business need to access it.
Product linking summary
Where customers link their Analytics property to another Google product or service account (“Integration Partner”), certain data from that Analytics property may be accessed and exported into the linked account. Once data is exported through a linking integration, it becomes subject to the Integration Partner’s terms and policies.
Note that once data is sent to an Integration Partner, that the data sent is subject to the terms of that Integration Partner and that Google Analytics no longer maintains access or control over that data.
Customers may review and manage their product integration linkings at any time within the Analytics product linking summary user interface.
Data sharing
Google Analytics provides several data sharing settings to customers, through which customers may customize how data collected using an Analytics data collection method (like the JavaScript code, mobile SDKs, and the Measurement Protocol) may be accessed and used by Google according to customer preferences. Note that these settings only apply to data collected from websites, mobile apps, and other digital devices using Analytics; they do not apply to data relating to a customer’s use of Analytics, such as the number of properties and which additional features are configured. Regardless of a customer’s data sharing settings, Analytics data may also be used only insofar as necessary to maintain and protect the Analytics service.

Data Controls for retention, deletion, and portability
Data retention
With the
Data Retention controls
, customers can limit or expand the duration for which their user-level and event-level data is stored in Google Analytics servers. All customers should review their Data Retention settings and ensure the appropriate retention is selected.
User deletion
Customers may delete a single user’s data from Google Analytics by passing a single user identifier to the
Google Analytics User Deletion API
or via our
User Explorer report
. However, this does not delete aggregate data associated with that user, such as page URLs visited.
User-level data access and portability
Customers may pull event information for any given user identifier via our
User Explorer report
or the
User Activity API
. These features enable customers to analyze and export event level data for a single user identifier. In addition, our 360 customers may integrate with BigQuery to create a full export of all event data associated with their users in a single queryable repository.
Advertising personalization
Customers may choose to limit use of their analytics data for advertising personalization purposes, instead of disabling the collection of all analytics data or advertising identifiers (see “
Privacy Controls in Google Analytics
”). Customers may choose to disable Advertising Personalization for data collected from their entire property, or to disable it for individual events or users (for
apps
,
websites
, and
measurement protocol
). Customers using Google Analytics for Firebase or Google Analytics 4 properties may also
exclude specific events or user properties
(like ‘purchase’ or ‘gender’) from being used for Ads Personalization.
If any of 1) all property-level data, 2) individual events, or 3) specific event names or user properties have been excluded from ads personalization, then Analytics will append an additional signal (called ‘npa’) in Postbacks indicating that networks should not use the data for personalized advertising. Note that each network's treatment of such 'npa' signal is determined by such network.
Data privacy and security
Certifications
ISO 27001
Google has earned ISO 27001 certification for the systems, applications, people, technology, processes, and data centers serving a number of Google products, including Google Analytics.

Information security
In web-based computing, security of both data and applications is critical. Google dedicates significant resources towards securing applications and data handling to prevent unauthorized access to data.
Data is stored in an encoded format optimized for performance, rather than stored in a traditional file system or database manner. Data is dispersed across a number of physical and logical volumes for redundancy and expedient access, thereby obfuscating it from tampering.
Google applications run in a multi-tenant, distributed environment. Rather than segregating each customer's data onto a single machine or set of machines, data from all Google users (consumers, business, and even Google's own data) is distributed among a shared infrastructure composed of Google's many homogeneous machines and located in Google's data centers.
In addition, Google Analytics ensures secure transmission of its JavaScript libraries and measurement data. Google Analytics by default uses HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which instructs browsers that support HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) to use that encryption protocol for all communication between end users, websites, and Google Analytics servers.

Operational security and disaster recovery
To minimize service interruption due to hardware failure, natural disaster, or other catastrophe, Google implements a comprehensive disaster-recovery program at all of its data centers. This program includes multiple components to eliminate single points of failure, including the following:
Data replication
: To help ensure availability in the event of a disaster, Google Analytics data stored in Google's distributed file system is replicated to separate systems in different data centers.
Geographical distribution of data centers
: Google operates a geographically distributed set of data centers that is designed to maintain service continuity in the event of a disaster or other incident in a single region.
Resilient and redundant infrastructure
: Google's computing clusters are designed with resiliency and redundancy in mind, helping minimize single points of failure and the impact of common equipment failures and environmental risks.
Continuity plan in the event of disaster
: In addition to the redundancy of data and regionally disparate data centers, Google also has a business-continuity plan for its headquarters in Mountain View, CA. This plan accounts for major disasters, such as a seismic event or a public-health crisis, and it assumes people and services may be unavailable for up to 30 days. This plan is designed to enable continued operations of our services for our customers.

Adara’s Privacy Promise
Adara is committed to your privacy. Adara’s Privacy Promise explains in a transparent way, what data, including personal data, is used in our business, how we process and share it, and your rights in relation to such data.
Adara is a business-to-business company that offers a technology platform (“Adara Platform” or “Platform”) which provides products and services enabling our clients to buy advertising space online and measure and analyze their campaigns.
All data we have access to will be collected, processed and protected consistent with applicable data protection laws, including where applicable the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and this Privacy Promise.
We may update this Privacy Promise, in order to align with evolving laws and regulations or due to changes in our business and technology. We’ll notify you of any material changes posting them clearly on our website or by other appropriate means. You should consult this page from time to time in order to be aware of any updates.
Who We Are
Adara is a technology company, headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and operating globally, with offices in Chicago, New York, Durham, Dubai, Barcelona, London, Paris, Dublin, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, and Sydney.
The entity that decides how and for what purposes personal data is processed is Adara, Inc. We have appointed a data protection officer to advise us and respond to data processing related inquiries (please see Section below entitled “
Contacting Us
”).
Adara adheres to the Internet Advertising Bureau Europe’s Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as well as the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s principles.
For What Purposes Do We Process Personal Data?
Adara provides digital advertising and analytics services for the benefit of our business customers, giving them the ability to reach and understand Internet users and consumers (like you) who are most likely to be interested in their respective products and services. Adara provides these services to customers such as website operators and mobile application developers (“Partners”). Consumers (like you) also benefit from Adara’s technology by receiving more relevant online marketing content: without our services you would still see ads online, but they would be less relevant to your interests.
Here is a common example of how the Adara Platform can benefit you and our Partners: if you visit an airline or hotel website to book a flight or a hotel room and the airline or hotel website is an Adara Partner, then we will receive your search or booking travel intent about the destination including some related information (dates, class of travel, number of people traveling with you – for a full list see the Section below entitled “
What Personal Data Does Adara Collect?”
). We do not collect your name or your email, or anything that tells us who you are “in the real world.” If we receive any email addresses then they are always in “hashed” (encoded) form so we never hold the actual email address.
Without knowing who you are, our Platform can automatically recognize that a user it has seen before is visiting another Adara Partner site, based on a random unique identifier we call an “Adara Recognized Traveler ID”. Information about travel interests and bookings are linked to the Adara ID and analyzed using proprietary algorithms to understand the user’s likely interests and travel activity.
Our Platform may use automated decision-making tools to seek to understand what type of traveler you are and allocate you a “score” or to a category with other travelers with similar interests, characteristics, and needs. This may enable us to create profiles which allow our Partners to provide more tailored offers or levels of customer service (but not to take decisions that have legal or similar significant effects on any user).
This improves our, and our Partners’ ability, to display relevant advertising to those with an interest in travel. In summary our purposes for processing data are the following:
Online advertising:
We will use the collected data to make decisions or buy, monitor, or report on the delivery of online advertising for our advertiser via ad exchanges. We may also share performance data (i.e. relating to viewability of the ad, clicks and any subsequent purchases) with advertisers and ad agencies. We may overlay third-party data collected from third-party data providers to enhance our decision making. We may also use data to target ads on other devices which we infer belong to the same user.
Measurement and Analytics
: Adara collates and classifies data in our database in aggregated form, which may then be made available via reporting or via the Adara Platform for high level trend analysis. We may also use the data to create analytics about travel industry trends, effectiveness of media, or for content marketing.
Traveler Intelligence:
Adara may share pseudonymous data, always aggregated to not identify one Partner or brand, with our Partners or clients for the purposes of enhancing their CRM for personalization or merchandising optimization.
Data may also be transferred in encrypted format to our vendors and suppliers; including cloud data centers and hosting providers. The data will also be used for specific internal Adara operations including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and statistical or survey purposes.
For purposes of GDPR, our legal basis for this data processing is your consent: all users must have notice of and consent to use of cookies or similar technologies by our Partners and to the provision of their data to Adara for processing as explained in this Privacy Promise. Cookie consents can be managed as set out in the Section below entitled “
How to Change Interest-Based Advertising Preferences
”, and other user rights are explained in the “
What Are Your Rights?
” Section. We may also process some data to further our and our Partners’ legitimate interests but only where such interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
What Do We Mean By Personal Data?
“Personal Data” covers more than just personally identifiable information such as name, address, email or phone numbers.
Under the GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, i.e. it can be a name or address, but also IP addresses and other “unique identifiers” such as device or cookie IDs.
Under the CCPA (implemented in the State of California on January 1, 2020), personal information is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could be reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Concretely, that would include names, email addresses, IP addresses, cookie IDs, device ID’s.
We also refer in this Privacy Promise to “pseudonymous” or “pseudonymized” personal data. We use this to refer to data that cannot be associated with an identifiable person, without the use of additional information which is kept separately. Normally, this means that such identifiable information is not available to Adara (so in Adara’s hands individuals are not identifiable).
What Personal Data Does Adara Collect?
The Adara Platform may collect personal data directly and receives personal data from our Partners that they have collected from their digital properties. The data processed on the Adara Platform (currently and over the last 12 months) is broken down into three trusted data sources about the travelers:
Technical identifiers and hashed or pseudonymized data as follows:
cookie identifier;
hashed email address;
postal address;
mobile device identifier;
hashed CRM identifier;
passenger number record;
approximate location data about the individual (e.g. the country they are located in when accessing an Adara Partner site)
Interests for products and services; and
Measurement statistics on the performances of Adara services.
Note that the Adara Platform cannot identify a user by name or their home address, but instead we try to understand users’ online travel behavior demographic characteristics, such as frequented destinations, type of trip (business vs leisure) and the types of travel, products and services they are interested in). Adara ensures that no information that can identify a user in the real world is stored on the Adara Platform, by requiring all such data to be hashed before it is transmitted to us.
We do not collect or categorize users based upon sensitive data or ‘special categories of data’, such as racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, information about health conditions or treatments or other similar or related information.
Neither do we intentionally collect information from, nor target any services to, or create any categories or profiles of, children under 16 years of age. If you believe that we may have collected information of a child under 16, please contact us as set out in the “
Contacting Us”
Section below.
Business Contact Data
Adara may hold your personal data if you or your employer has a business relationship with us or if you or we are considering entering some form of business relationship.
You could be a client (e.g. an advertiser), a publisher, a data provider or other supplier, and we would need to process your personal data in order to communicate with you, invoice our services, and manage the relationship. The personal data we hold about you refers to your professional life (name, business email address, billing address, office address, business phone numbers, title, qualifications, employer etc.). For potential clients or suppliers, we need to process similar data in order to grow and manage our business and evaluate products and services. In addition, if you visit our website, we may collect data using cookies and other technologies.
We obtain this information directly from you or your employer, or otherwise from exchanging emails or business cards, meeting at industry events, business networking, or at meetings etc. The legal basis for our processing of this data is that we have a legitimate interest in doing so (i.e. in managing and developing our business) for which this data processing is necessary, and which does not have a negative impact on your privacy (as this is professional data only). We may also process this personal data where such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. We do not have to obtain your consent in order to hold and carry on processing this data. Nevertheless, you can exercise your data subjects’ rights in relation to your personal data (see Section below entitled
“What are your rights?”
).
We store this data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
From What Sources Do We Collect Personal Data?
When a user visits one of our Partner’s digital properties they are provided notice of and/or asked to agree to the collection and analysis of information about individual consumer interests by way of “pixels” that we provide to our Partners.
A Partner pixel assigns a unique identifier (a random, unique string of characters) to the user, a “cookie”. A pixel collects and stores information about what the user does on the Partner website or application, and which Partner sites or apps the user visits as well as how the users view and interact with the online ad (for instance the time it is viewable by the user, whether they click on the ad). Similar technologies are used when a user views an email from a Partner with an Adara tag, uses an app with an Adara SDK installed, or sees or interacts with an online advertisement which has been placed through our Platform.
Adara may engage in cross-device data collection and targeting. This means we use third party providers to determine the likelihood that a given user on a desktop browser is the same user on a mobile or other device, and then we link the information we have on their different devices. Adara may also engage in cross-app data collection and targeting.
Where permitted, some Partners use hashed emails as identifiers and Adara may sync hashed emails received from other Partners in order to gain a fuller picture of the user’s travel preferences. We can then build segments, or receive segment data from our Partners and clients, to understand better the data associated with that unique ID. In this case the hashed email is used in a similar way to a cookie ID –Adara does not know the real email address nor can we send emails using it.
The Security of Your Personal Data
Adara cares about your privacy and employs industry standard administrative, physical and technical measures designed to protect your personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access.
Is Your Personal Data Transferred Internationally?
Adara’s headquarters are in California. All of our data is ultimately sent to the United States, after being collected via our data centers in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Singapore, and South Carolina/Oregon, United States.
As we process data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA” – which in this Privacy Promise includes the UK), we may transfer Personal Data to any other country where our partners, processors or sub-processors maintain facilities.
When our services involve the storage and/or processing of Personal Data outside of the EEA in a jurisdiction such as the US that is not the object of an EU “adequacy” decision or UK adequacy regulations, as applicable, then we only do so on the basis of protective contracts and agreements along with legally required transfer mechanisms, which commit recipients to similar data protection standards as in the EEA, such as the standard contractual clauses (SCC) issued by the European Commission, the UK and/or other responsible Supervisory Authorities.
Where Adara uses this transfer mechanism, Adara ensures, and also requires its data processors to ensure, that sufficient legal and practical safeguards are in place to permit the transfers for the relevant purposes.
In addition, although the EU-US Privacy Shield does not by itself permit international transfers of personal data, Adara also adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access and recourse, enforcement and liability.
In this Privacy Promise, we have set out the categories of personal data that we may receive in the US, as well as the purposes for which we use personal data. We will not use your personal data for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose we collected it for or that you later authorized, except in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Adara maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We have also set out above the relevant security provisions and access rights available to you.
Who Else May Receive Your Personal Data?
We also engage other companies to provide data processing services including, among other things, data storage, maintenance services and the provision of support services. With these data processors we enter into contracts that require them to adhere to security standards as stringent as ours. A list of our principal data processing partners is set out in the Annex at the end of this Privacy Promise.
Adara is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. We enter into written agreements with those third-party agents and service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection and we follow appropriate transfer mechanisms such as the standard contractual clauses and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf. We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party agents and service providers process personal data in accordance with our contracts, data processing addenda and the standard contractual clauses. Adara remains liable if third-party agents that we engage to process such personal data on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with our data processing addenda and the standard contractual clauses. Please click
HERE
for more information on our third-party partners.
We may access, preserve, and disclose any data we store in association with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iii) enforce our policies or contracts; (iv) collect amounts owed to us; or (v) assist with an investigation and prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then data we hold may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.
Transfers of personal data out of the EEA are normally based on EU model clauses, otherwise known as Standard Contractual Clauses, issued by the European Commission or other responsible Supervisory Authorities (please see the previous Section). If we receive a valid request, then we may make available a copy of the safeguards applicable to relevant international transfers.
How Long Do We Process Personal Data For?
Adara will never store personal data for longer than necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, and always in accordance with data privacy laws and regulations. We expire cookie data after 13 months for targeting purposes and delete personal data after 24 months for insights and analytics purposes.
For online identifiers like Mobile IDs that remain active indefinitely for the use of the device, Adara dissociates the data after the same data retention periods stated above.
Please note that we may sometimes need to retain data for longer where necessary to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our agreements, in which case we will only process it for those restricted purposes.
What Are Your Rights? (for European Residents)
The GDPR lists various rights in connection with your personal data including:
The right to be informed
The right of access
The right of rectification
The right to erasure
The right to restrict processing
The right to data portability
The right to object to particular processing activities (e.g., marketing or profiling)
In particular, in relation to personal data relating to you that we process:
You may request access to the personal data we hold about you (including categories or scores allocated).
You may be entitled to request that we erase the personal data concerned (or at least have us restrict its processing), subject to any legal requirements that require us to keep it.
Where we are processing personal data relating to you on the basis of your prior consent to that processing, you may withdraw your consent at any time (although this will not affect the legality of any processing based on consent that was carried out before the consent was withdrawn). Normally you will do this through the Partner website, after which we will be notified, or you can contact us directly to withdraw your consent.
In order to process your request we may need to confirm that the identifier we hold matches the information you provide. This request can be made and carried out
HERE
. Alternatively, you can also email
privacy@adara.com
.
We will respond to each request within 30 days.
Please note that we may be required to ask you for further information in order to confirm your identity before we provide or make other changes relating to the personal data requested.
If you have a complaint about any processing of your personal data conducted by us, you can contact us at
privacy@adara.com
or
dpo@adara.com
and we will do our best to resolve the issue. If you believe we have not done so properly, you also have the right to lodge a formal compliant with the relevant Supervisory Authority in your country or to use the mechanisms referred to in the Section below entitled “
Contacting Us
”.
The Data Protection Commission (for European Residents)
As our EU operations are controlled from Ireland, the Data Protection Commission (which is the Supervisory Authority in Ireland) can provide further information about your rights and our obligations in relation to your personal data, as well as deal with any complaints that you have about our processing of your personal data. You can consult their website for more information:
https://www.dataprotection.ie
Our DPO (data protection officer) is registered with the DPC.
New US State Privacy laws
Consumers who are resident in US states such as California, Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, or Utah may have additional rights under state privacy legislation which defines personal information more broadly, ensures greater transparency and accountability and provides consumers with extended rights as to the collection and use of their personal information
.
Your rights under US State Privacy Laws:
If you are resident in one of the states where specific privacy legislation is in effect then, depending on the particular provisions of applicable local laws, you may have some or all of the following rights:
Right to correction: Consumers have the right to request a business that possesses inaccurate personal information about the consumer to correct such inaccurate personal information, taking into the account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.
Right to notice: Businesses must inform consumers at or before the point of collection what categories of personal information will be collected and the purposes for which these categories will be used.
Right to access: Consumers have the right to request that a business disclose the categories of personal information collected; the categories of sources from which personal information is collected; the business or commercial purpose; the categories of third parties with which the business shares personal information; and the specific pieces of personal information the business holds about a consumer. If a business sells personal information or discloses it for business purposes, consumers have the right to request the categories of information so sold or disclosed.
Right to opt out: Consumers have the right—at any time—to direct businesses that sell or share personal information about the consumer to third parties to stop such sales or sharing, known as the right to opt out. If a consumer is a minor, this becomes a right to opt in to the sale or sharing of data (exercised by the minor if the consumer is between 13 and 16 years of age, or by the minor’s parent or guardian if the consumer is under 13 years old). Businesses must wait at least 12 months before asking consumers to opt back in.
Right to request deletion: Consumers also have the right to request deletion of personal information, but only where that information was collected from the consumer. Like the right to erasure under the GDPR, this right is subject to exceptions. For instance, businesses need not delete personal information necessary for detecting security incidents, exercising free speech, protecting or defending against legal claims, or—in what is potentially a broad and likely contentious category—for internal uses reasonably aligned with the consumer’s expectations.
Right to limit use of sensitive information; Consumers have the right to restrict a business’s use of sensitive personal information e.g. to use that is necessary to provide goods or services requested, to certain business purposes, or other legally permitted purposes.
Right to equal services and prices: Businesses must not discriminate against consumers by denying goods or services, charging a different price or rate for goods or services, providing a different level or quality of goods or services, or suggesting that they will do any of these things based upon a consumer’s exercise of any of their legal rights relating to their personal information. Put differently, consumers have a right to equal services and prices.
Exercising your rights under US state laws:
If you want to make a request for exercise of any of the above rights, you (or your authorized agent) can write to
privacy@adara.co
m  and we will respond within 45 days as per the law.
If you make such a request, including through an authorized agent, we reserve the right to verify your identity and the agent’s authorization.
However, we may not be able to respond to your request if it is not permitted or foreseen under applicable law.
(Please note that we do transfer personal information collected through our network of partners to third parties and as such are considered as having disclosed or sold or shared data over the past twelve months. Please see Section 16 below for more information).
What Are Your Rights? (for Brazil Residents)
The Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) applies to any resident or any company (located in Brazil or abroad) collecting or/and processing data from Brazilian residents. A data protection authority will soon be established and will offer guidelines and guidance with regards to compliance. Adara collects data based on a valid legal basis such as consent (consentimento) or legitimate interests (interesse legítimo) as per article 7.1 of LGPD. Adara is in the process of appointing a Data Protection Officer (“Encarregado”).
Data subjects have the following rights under the LGPD
confirmation of processing
access
correction
anonymization or deletion
portability
elimination
information
revocation of consent
opposition
rectification
How to Change Interest-Based Advertising Preferences and Your Opt Out Choices
Adara provides several mechanisms for users to change their preferences in relation to Adara’s advertising and analytics services:
using Adara’s mechanism provided
here
on adara.com,
clicking on the relevant link on the advert itself, or
using browser based or mobile based cookie and privacy management settings
In all cases, all these choices will be recorded and/or honored by Adara.
Mobile Opt-Out
To change consents for the collection and use of data for interest-based advertising on your mobile device, you can modify the settings on your mobile device. To reset your mobile advertising ID or to prevent receipt of interest-based ads in mobile apps, please follow your mobile device maker’s most current published instructions, such as the examples linked below (current as of the date of this version of our Privacy Promise):
For Android Devices (version 8.0 and higher): Open the Settings app, Select Google, Select Ads, and enable the “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” setting.
For Apple Devices: Devices with iOS 6 and above use Apple’s Advertising Identifier. To learn more about limiting ad tracking using this identifier, visit the Settings menu on your device as follows: Go to Settings, Select Privacy, Select Advertising, and enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. For more information about different iOS versions, please see:
https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT202074
.
When you have changed these settings on a device, and when Adara receives this signal, Adara will not use in-app information collected from that device to infer your interests or serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests.
Note: The specific settings instructions for each device may differ slightly depending on which version of the operating software you are running.
In addition, as noted above, we participate in the DAA’s Ad Choices program. So, each of our mobile ads includes the AdChoices Icon, on which you can tap to go to a preferences page.
