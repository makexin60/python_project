To protect the PI PTC collects or transmits, PTC uses reasonable security measures, including physical, technical, and procedural safeguards.
Please note, however, that while PTC uses reasonable security measures, no method of transmitting or storing electronic information is ever completely secure, and thus we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that your information will never be accessed, used, or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (WHETHER CONSEQUENTIAL, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, A THIRD PARTY'S UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT, OR OTHER THEORIES OF LIABILITY, AND ALSO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE ARE GIVEN ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE THAT DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS.
We also use reasonable security measures when verifying a consumer privacy request and/or transmitting PI to a consumer in response to a consumer privacy request.
Personal Information Collection for Minors
Our products and website are not directed to minors under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect or sell the PI of consumers less than 16 years of age. If you believe that PTC has collected information of a consumer less than 16 years of age, please contact our Privacy Office at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com
.
Third-Party Sites
This Privacy Notice is applicable only to the website on which it is posted, and it does not apply to any third-party websites.
The website may contain links to, and media and other content from, third-party websites. These links are to external websites and third parties with which we may have no relationship. Because of the dynamic media capabilities of our website, it may not be clear to you which links are to our website and which are to external, third-party websites. If you click on an embedded third-party link, you will be redirected away from our website to the external third-party website. You can check the URL to confirm that you have left this website.
We cannot and do not (1) guarantee the adequacy of the privacy and security practices employed by or the content and media provided by any third parties or their websites, (2) control third parties’ independent collection or use or your PI, or (3) endorse any third-party information, products, services or websites that may be reached through embedded links on this website.

Cookies and Online Tracking Technologies
PTC and some of our third-party business partners (such as advertising services and analytics providers) use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other tracking technologies when you interact with our emails, visit any of our websites or use any of our Pilot Flying J mobile applications. These technologies help us to bring you a more cohesive and worthwhile experience, assist us with analytics information, and facilitate advertising and marketing efforts, among other things. The following sections explain the tools that we and our third-party business partners use.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file created by a web server that can be stored on your device for use either during a particular browsing session (a "session cookie") or a future session (a "persistent cookie"). Many browsers are designed to accept cookies by default; however, you can modify your browser settings either to notify you when you have received a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. Please note that certain areas of our websites and applications may not function properly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.
Some examples of why we use and allow our third-party business partners to use cookies:
To identify first time visitors and recognize returning guests
To learn about how you reach and interact with our websites
To detect general geographic location and provide location-based information
To detect and prevent fraud
To conduct analytics activities
To optimize and customize our websites and services
To facilitate Interest Based Advertising
Other Online Tracking Technologies
In many cases, the collection of your personal information using these online tracking technologies is controlled by PTC. However, in some cases the data collected through use of these tracking technologies is controlled by our vendors or other third parties.
Examples of other online tracking technologies we may use:
Beacons/Pixels
These are embedded images or objects that are used on web pages or emails. They help companies to unobtrusively understand how visitors navigate website pages and can verify when specific content has been accessed. We may use web beacons or pixels to:
Improve our websites and services
Detect and prevent fraud
Verify system and server integrity
Better understand how many people visit our webpages or view specific content
Embedded Scripts
We may use embedded scripts that collect information about your interactions with our websites, mobile apps, and advertisements. These scripts are temporarily loaded into your web browser and are active only while you are connected to our website, mobile app, or advertisement.
Location Technology
We may use global positioning or other location identifying technologies to locate your device. This helps PTC ensure we are compliant with geographically significant regulations, as well as other consumer services like finding the next PTC location or booking driver services like showers and parking.
In-app Tracking
Mobile application tracking may include a variety of technologies like software development kit (SDK), device identifiers such as mobile ad IDs (MAID), or identifiers for advertisers (IDFA) that associates your user activity on a given app and helps us track activity across multiple apps and/or devices.
Device and Activity Monitoring
We may use technologies that monitor and record your interactions with our websites and mobile apps, such as your keystrokes and click-related activity. These technologies may also collect and analyze information from your device, such your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts.
We may monitor devices and activity:
To enhance and customize your experience
To better respond to your inquiries and requests
To detect and prevent fraud
To detect cyber incidents and other malicious activity
To verify systems and server availability and integrity
To troubleshoot issues
To improve our websites, mobile apps, and services

Third-party Analytics
PTC may use analytics providers - like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or others - to obtain analytical information about our websites and applications. These providers may use cookies and other tracking technologies that help us analyze how our guests use or interact with our websites, services, advertisements, and mobile applications.
For more information about Google Analytics, please see: the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Analytics Privacy Policy.

You can also make choices about data collection for certain companies by visiting an industry consumer choice platform such as the NAI (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
) or DAA (
https://optout.aboutads.info/
). You may still receive ads after limiting processing of information for interest-based advertising, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.
Communications Opt-Out
If you no longer wish to receive general or promotional communications from us via email, you may opt-out by clicking the “unsubscribe” link available at the bottom of our email communications.
If you have opted into receiving SMS text communications, you can opt out-out by replying STOP to a received SMS message. You will receive a response confirming that you have been unsubscribed.
Do Not Track
We do not recognize the Do Not Track (DNT) signal. We do recognize the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal which gives users the ability to opt out of the use of tracking technologies and communicate those preferences to any website they visit.
Rights And Choices About How We Use And Disclose Your Information
PTC values you, our guests, and appreciates the opportunity to serve you. In addition to understanding how we secure and process your data, we also want you to understand rights and choices regarding the PI that you have shared with us. There are laws in Canada and numerous US states that provide the following rights (subject to certain exceptions). Pilot accepts the following qualified individual rights requests from all our guests, even if their state has no comprehensive privacy law:
Right to Access - the right to know the PI we have collected about you or the right to confirm whether we are processing your PI
Right to Delete - the right to delete the PI we have collected about you
Right to Rectify - the right to correct/amend PI we have collected about you
Right to Restrict -  the right to limit the use or disclosure of certain categories of PI Right to a Portable Copy - the right to request a copy of the PI we have collected about you
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing – the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising of PI we have collected about you (dependent on your location)
Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising (dependent on your location)
Right to Withdraw Consent (Canada only) – the right to withdraw your consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of your PI
We will respond to these requests consistent with applicable data privacy laws in your state or jurisdiction, many of which limit the scope of these rights.  If you are a resident of a state or jurisdiction without such laws, we will respond in a manner that is consistent with limitations or restrictions under data privacy laws in another state or jurisdiction.
In addition, there are rights offered under some state data privacy laws which we only provide to residents of those states, on or after the effective date of those laws:
Residents of Oregon and Minnesota may request that we identify the third parties to which we have disclosed personal information.
Residents of some states with data privacy laws may appeal denials of any data subject rights offered to them under their state’s data privacy law.
With reference to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, we allow California residents to opt out of the disclosure of personal information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To exercise that opt-out option,

.
NOTE: The information you submit in a privacy rights request form must match the information you used when you opened your account. If we are unable to match the information submitted to the information we have collected, we may not be able to fulfill your request.
If a request is submitted in a manner that is not one of the designated methods for submission, or if the request is deficient in some manner unrelated to our verification process, we will provide you with specific directions on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with the request, as applicable.
If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.
PTC will not discriminate against consumers for exercising any of the rights described herein. This includes denying goods or services, charging different prices, or providing a different level or quality of service. However, PTC can offer consumer’s different rates (or service) if that difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. See our Notice of Financial Incentive below for more information.
Identity Verification
PTC will process certain individual rights requests only after your identity can be verified. Please note that there may be instances where access to your PI may be restricted by law or by our policy to respond to requests made by residents of states without a data privacy law in a manner consistent with existing state data privacy laws. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may request additional information for the express purpose of validating your identity. If we do not fulfil your request for the disclosure of all or some of your PI, we will advise you of the specific reasons for restricting access, barring any legal or regulatory limitations.
After submitting the request form for requests other than opt-out requests, you will be asked to electronically verify your identity. If you complete verification successfully, your request becomes live in the Privacy Portal. If you are unsuccessful at the initial verification attempt, PTC may require you to submit additional information, such as first name, last name, date of birth, address, phone number, or email address. Once verified, the Privacy Office will begin to process your request.
Access Rights – Requests to Know
The Right to Access Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold

Specifically, we may disclose your IP address, browser information and other device information relating to your interaction with our Electronic Platform.

Authorized Agents
Authorized Agents may submit opt-out requests for consumers under several state data privacy laws; this is not an option that is available under the laws in Iowa, Texas, Utah, or Virginia.  Authorized Agents may submit all types of data subject requests on behalf of a California resident; they may not submit requests other than opt-out requests on behalf of residents of other states. To submit a request as an Authorized Agent on behalf of a consumer, please contact our Privacy Office at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com
.
If you are a California resident and you use an agent to request access to, deletion, or correction of your personal information, the agent will need to provide us with your signed permission indicating the agent has been authorized to submit the request on your behalf. We will also require that you verify your identity directly with us or confirm with us that you provided the agent with permission to submit the request. We may deny a request from an Authorized Agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the consumer to act on their behalf.
When We Do Not Act on a Request – Appeal Process
In some cases, we may not act on your verified requests (e.g., if we cannot do so under other laws that apply). When this is the case, we will explain our reasons for not providing you with the information or taking the action (e.g., correcting data) you requested.
Additionally, residents of some states with data privacy laws may have the right to appeal our decision by contacting us at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com
within 30 days after your receipt of our decision. Please provide us with the case ID number and the full name exactly as submitted on the original request.
Precise Geolocation Opt-Out
If you wish to opt-out of precise geolocation for the purpose of locating nearby travel centers and corresponding fuel pricing online or through the myRewards Plus mobile app, you must do so by disabling precise geolocation in your device settings.
Opt-out Preference Signals
An opt-out preference signal is sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism on behalf of consumers and communicates a consumer’s choice to opt out of the sale and sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising with all businesses that recognize the signal, without having to make individualized requests. The signal can be set on certain browsers or through opt-out plug-in tools.
We recognize the Global Privacy Control signal. We do this at the browser level, so it does not apply to personal information we may collect offline or that we may associate only with your name or email address. This means that if the signal is sent through a specific browser, we will recognize it for that browser only, and only with respect to the identifiers for that browser. If you would like more information about opt-out preference signals, including how to use them, the Global Privacy Control website has such information (
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
).

To protect the PI PTC collects or transmits, PTC uses reasonable security measures, including physical, technical, and procedural safeguards.
Please note, however, that while PTC uses reasonable security measures, no method of transmitting or storing electronic information is ever completely secure, and thus we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that your information will never be accessed, used, or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (WHETHER CONSEQUENTIAL, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, A THIRD PARTY'S UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT, OR OTHER THEORIES OF LIABILITY, AND ALSO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE ARE GIVEN ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE THAT DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS.
We also use reasonable security measures when verifying a consumer privacy request and/or transmitting PI to a consumer in response to a consumer privacy request.
Personal Information Collection for Minors
Our products and website are not directed to minors under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect or sell the PI of consumers less than 16 years of age. If you believe that PTC has collected information of a consumer less than 16 years of age, please contact our Privacy Office at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com

Third-Party Sites
This Privacy Notice is applicable only to the website on which it is posted, and it does not apply to any third-party websites.
The website may contain links to, and media and other content from, third-party websites. These links are to external websites and third parties with which we may have no relationship. Because of the dynamic media capabilities of our website, it may not be clear to you which links are to our website and which are to external, third-party websites. If you click on an embedded third-party link, you will be redirected away from our website to the external third-party website. You can check the URL to confirm that you have left this website.

Cookies and Online Tracking Technologies
PTC and some of our third-party business partners (such as advertising services and analytics providers) use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other tracking technologies when you interact with our emails, visit any of our websites or use any of our Pilot Flying J mobile applications. These technologies help us to bring you a more cohesive and worthwhile experience, assist us with analytics information, and facilitate advertising and marketing efforts, among other things. The following sections explain the tools that we and our third-party business partners use.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file created by a web server that can be stored on your device for use either during a particular browsing session (a "session cookie") or a future session (a "persistent cookie"). Many browsers are designed to accept cookies by default; however, you can modify your browser settings either to notify you when you have received a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. Please note that certain areas of our websites and applications may not function properly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.
Some examples of why we use and allow our third-party business partners to use cookies:
To identify first time visitors and recognize returning guests
To learn about how you reach and interact with our websites
To detect general geographic location and provide location-based information
To detect and prevent fraud
To conduct analytics activities
To optimize and customize our websites and services
To facilitate Interest Based Advertising
Other Online Tracking Technologies
In many cases, the collection of your personal information using these online tracking technologies is controlled by PTC. However, in some cases the data collected through use of these tracking technologies is controlled by our vendors or other third parties.
Examples of other online tracking technologies we may use:
Beacons/Pixels
These are embedded images or objects that are used on web pages or emails. They help companies to unobtrusively understand how visitors navigate website pages and can verify when specific content has been accessed. We may use web beacons or pixels to:
Improve our websites and services
Detect and prevent fraud
Verify system and server integrity
Better understand how many people visit our webpages or view specific content
Embedded Scripts
We may use embedded scripts that collect information about your interactions with our websites, mobile apps, and advertisements. These scripts are temporarily loaded into your web browser and are active only while you are connected to our website, mobile app, or advertisement.
Location Technology
We may use global positioning or other location identifying technologies to locate your device. This helps PTC ensure we are compliant with geographically significant regulations, as well as other consumer services like finding the next PTC location or booking driver services like showers and parking.
In-app Tracking
Mobile application tracking may include a variety of technologies like software development kit (SDK), device identifiers such as mobile ad IDs (MAID), or identifiers for advertisers (IDFA) that associates your user activity on a given app and helps us track activity across multiple apps and/or devices.
Device and Activity Monitoring
We may use technologies that monitor and record your interactions with our websites and mobile apps, such as your keystrokes and click-related activity. These technologies may also collect and analyze information from your device, such your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts.
We may monitor devices and activity:
To enhance and customize your experience
To better respond to your inquiries and requests
To detect and prevent fraud
To detect cyber incidents and other malicious activity
To verify systems and server availability and integrity
To troubleshoot issues
To improve our websites, mobile apps, and services

Third-party Analytics
PTC may use analytics providers - like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or others - to obtain analytical information about our websites and applications. These providers may use cookies and other tracking technologies that help us analyze how our guests use or interact with our websites, services, advertisements, and mobile applications.

You can also make choices about data collection for certain companies by visiting an industry consumer choice platform such as the NAI (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
) or DAA (
https://optout.aboutads.info/
). You may still receive ads after limiting processing of information for interest-based advertising, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.
Communications Opt-Out
If you no longer wish to receive general or promotional communications from us via email, you may opt-out by clicking the “unsubscribe” link available at the bottom of our email communications.
If you have opted into receiving SMS text communications, you can opt out-out by replying STOP to a received SMS message. You will receive a response confirming that you have been unsubscribed.
Do Not Track
We do not recognize the Do Not Track (DNT) signal. We do recognize the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal which gives users the ability to opt out of the use of tracking technologies and communicate those preferences to any website they visit.
Rights And Choices About How We Use And Disclose Your Information
PTC values you, our guests, and appreciates the opportunity to serve you. In addition to understanding how we secure and process your data, we also want you to understand rights and choices regarding the PI that you have shared with us. There are laws in Canada and numerous US states that provide the following rights (subject to certain exceptions). Pilot accepts the following qualified individual rights requests from all our guests, even if their state has no comprehensive privacy law:
Right to Access - the right to know the PI we have collected about you or the right to confirm whether we are processing your PI
Right to Delete - the right to delete the PI we have collected about you
Right to Rectify - the right to correct/amend PI we have collected about you
Right to Restrict -  the right to limit the use or disclosure of certain categories of PI Right to a Portable Copy - the right to request a copy of the PI we have collected about you
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing – the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising of PI we have collected about you (dependent on your location)
Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising (dependent on your location)
Right to Withdraw Consent (Canada only) – the right to withdraw your consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of your PI
We will respond to these requests consistent with applicable data privacy laws in your state or jurisdiction, many of which limit the scope of these rights.  If you are a resident of a state or jurisdiction without such laws, we will respond in a manner that is consistent with limitations or restrictions under data privacy laws in another state or jurisdiction.
In addition, there are rights offered under some state data privacy laws which we only provide to residents of those states, on or after the effective date of those laws:
Residents of Oregon and Minnesota may request that we identify the third parties to which we have disclosed personal information.
Residents of some states with data privacy laws may appeal denials of any data subject rights offered to them under their state’s data privacy law.
With reference to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, we allow California residents to opt out of the disclosure of personal information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To exercise that opt-out option,

.
NOTE: The information you submit in a privacy rights request form must match the information you used when you opened your account. If we are unable to match the information submitted to the information we have collected, we may not be able to fulfill your request.
If a request is submitted in a manner that is not one of the designated methods for submission, or if the request is deficient in some manner unrelated to our verification process, we will provide you with specific directions on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with the request, as applicable.
If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.
PTC will not discriminate against consumers for exercising any of the rights described herein. This includes denying goods or services, charging different prices, or providing a different level or quality of service. However, PTC can offer consumer’s different rates (or service) if that difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. See our Notice of Financial Incentive below for more information.
Identity Verification
PTC will process certain individual rights requests only after your identity can be verified. Please note that there may be instances where access to your PI may be restricted by law or by our policy to respond to requests made by residents of states without a data privacy law in a manner consistent with existing state data privacy laws. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may request additional information for the express purpose of validating your identity. If we do not fulfil your request for the disclosure of all or some of your PI, we will advise you of the specific reasons for restricting access, barring any legal or regulatory limitations.
After submitting the request form for requests other than opt-out requests, you will be asked to electronically verify your identity. If you complete verification successfully, your request becomes live in the Privacy Portal. If you are unsuccessful at the initial verification attempt, PTC may require you to submit additional information, such as first name, last name, date of birth, address, phone number, or email address. Once verified, the Privacy Office will begin to process your request.
Access Rights – Requests to Know
The Right to Access Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold
You have the right to request that PTC disclose the PI we collected about you. Upon the receipt of a verified request and in accordance with our data retention practice, we will provide the following:

We will not disclose Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, other government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, health insurance numbers, medical identification numbers, account passwords, and security questions and answers.

Authorized Agents
Authorized Agents may submit opt-out requests for consumers under several state data privacy laws; this is not an option that is available under the laws in Iowa, Texas, Utah, or Virginia.  Authorized Agents may submit all types of data subject requests on behalf of a California resident; they may not submit requests other than opt-out requests on behalf of residents of other states. To submit a request as an Authorized Agent on behalf of a consumer, please contact our Privacy Office at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com

When We Do Not Act on a Request – Appeal Process
In some cases, we may not act on your verified requests (e.g., if we cannot do so under other laws that apply). When this is the case, we will explain our reasons for not providing you with the information or taking the action (e.g., correcting data) you requested.
Additionally, residents of some states with data privacy laws may have the right to appeal our decision by contacting us at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com
within 30 days after your receipt of our decision. Please provide us with the case ID number and the full name exactly as submitted on the original request.

An opt-out preference signal is sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism on behalf of consumers and communicates a consumer’s choice to opt out of the sale and sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising with all businesses that recognize the signal, without having to make individualized requests. The signal can be set on certain browsers or through opt-out plug-in tools.
We recognize the Global Privacy Control signal. We do this at the browser level, so it does not apply to personal information we may collect offline or that we may associate only with your name or email address. This means that if the signal is sent through a specific browser, we will recognize it for that browser only, and only with respect to the identifiers for that browser. If you would like more information about opt-out preference signals, including how to use them, the Global Privacy Control website has such information (
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
).

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

To protect the PI PTC collects or transmits, PTC uses reasonable security measures, including physical, technical, and procedural safeguards.
Please note, however, that while PTC uses reasonable security measures, no method of transmitting or storing electronic information is ever completely secure, and thus we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that your information will never be accessed, used, or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (WHETHER CONSEQUENTIAL, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, A THIRD PARTY'S UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT, OR OTHER THEORIES OF LIABILITY, AND ALSO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE ARE GIVEN ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE THAT DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS.
We also use reasonable security measures when verifying a consumer privacy request and/or transmitting PI to a consumer in response to a consumer privacy request.
Personal Information Collection for Minors
Our products and website are not directed to minors under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect or sell the PI of consumers less than 16 years of age. If you believe that PTC has collected information of a consumer less than 16 years of age, please contact our Privacy Office at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com
.
Third-Party Sites
This Privacy Notice is applicable only to the website on which it is posted, and it does not apply to any third-party websites.
The website may contain links to, and media and other content from, third-party websites. These links are to external websites and third parties with which we may have no relationship. Because of the dynamic media capabilities of our website, it may not be clear to you which links are to our website and which are to external, third-party websites. If you click on an embedded third-party link, you will be redirected away from our website to the external third-party website. You can check the URL to confirm that you have left this website.

Cookies and Online Tracking Technologies
PTC and some of our third-party business partners (such as advertising services and analytics providers) use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other tracking technologies when you interact with our emails, visit any of our websites or use any of our Pilot Flying J mobile applications. These technologies help us to bring you a more cohesive and worthwhile experience, assist us with analytics information, and facilitate advertising and marketing efforts, among other things. The following sections explain the tools that we and our third-party business partners use.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file created by a web server that can be stored on your device for use either during a particular browsing session (a "session cookie") or a future session (a "persistent cookie"). Many browsers are designed to accept cookies by default; however, you can modify your browser settings either to notify you when you have received a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. Please note that certain areas of our websites and applications may not function properly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.
Some examples of why we use and allow our third-party business partners to use cookies:
To identify first time visitors and recognize returning guests
To learn about how you reach and interact with our websites
To detect general geographic location and provide location-based information
To detect and prevent fraud
To conduct analytics activities
To optimize and customize our websites and services
To facilitate Interest Based Advertising
Other Online Tracking Technologies
In many cases, the collection of your personal information using these online tracking technologies is controlled by PTC. However, in some cases the data collected through use of these tracking technologies is controlled by our vendors or other third parties.
Examples of other online tracking technologies we may use:
Beacons/Pixels
These are embedded images or objects that are used on web pages or emails. They help companies to unobtrusively understand how visitors navigate website pages and can verify when specific content has been accessed. We may use web beacons or pixels to:
Improve our websites and services
Detect and prevent fraud
Verify system and server integrity
Better understand how many people visit our webpages or view specific content
Embedded Scripts
We may use embedded scripts that collect information about your interactions with our websites, mobile apps, and advertisements. These scripts are temporarily loaded into your web browser and are active only while you are connected to our website, mobile app, or advertisement.
Location Technology
We may use global positioning or other location identifying technologies to locate your device. This helps PTC ensure we are compliant with geographically significant regulations, as well as other consumer services like finding the next PTC location or booking driver services like showers and parking.
In-app Tracking
Mobile application tracking may include a variety of technologies like software development kit (SDK), device identifiers such as mobile ad IDs (MAID), or identifiers for advertisers (IDFA) that associates your user activity on a given app and helps us track activity across multiple apps and/or devices.
Device and Activity Monitoring
We may use technologies that monitor and record your interactions with our websites and mobile apps, such as your keystrokes and click-related activity. These technologies may also collect and analyze information from your device, such your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts.
We may monitor devices and activity:
To enhance and customize your experience
To better respond to your inquiries and requests
To detect and prevent fraud
To detect cyber incidents and other malicious activity
To verify systems and server availability and integrity
To troubleshoot issues
To improve our websites, mobile apps, and services

Third-party Analytics
PTC may use analytics providers - like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or others - to obtain analytical information about our websites and applications. These providers may use cookies and other tracking technologies that help us analyze how our guests use or interact with our websites, services, advertisements, and mobile applications.

You can also make choices about data collection for certain companies by visiting an industry consumer choice platform such as the NAI (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
) or DAA (
https://optout.aboutads.info/
). You may still receive ads after limiting processing of information for interest-based advertising, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.
Communications Opt-Out
If you no longer wish to receive general or promotional communications from us via email, you may opt-out by clicking the “unsubscribe” link available at the bottom of our email communications.
If you have opted into receiving SMS text communications, you can opt out-out by replying STOP to a received SMS message. You will receive a response confirming that you have been unsubscribed.
Do Not Track
We do not recognize the Do Not Track (DNT) signal. We do recognize the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal which gives users the ability to opt out of the use of tracking technologies and communicate those preferences to any website they visit.
Rights And Choices About How We Use And Disclose Your Information
PTC values you, our guests, and appreciates the opportunity to serve you. In addition to understanding how we secure and process your data, we also want you to understand rights and choices regarding the PI that you have shared with us. There are laws in Canada and numerous US states that provide the following rights (subject to certain exceptions). Pilot accepts the following qualified individual rights requests from all our guests, even if their state has no comprehensive privacy law:
Right to Access - the right to know the PI we have collected about you or the right to confirm whether we are processing your PI
Right to Delete - the right to delete the PI we have collected about you
Right to Rectify - the right to correct/amend PI we have collected about you
Right to Restrict -  the right to limit the use or disclosure of certain categories of PI Right to a Portable Copy - the right to request a copy of the PI we have collected about you
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing – the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising of PI we have collected about you (dependent on your location)
Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising (dependent on your location)
Right to Withdraw Consent (Canada only) – the right to withdraw your consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of your PI
We will respond to these requests consistent with applicable data privacy laws in your state or jurisdiction, many of which limit the scope of these rights.  If you are a resident of a state or jurisdiction without such laws, we will respond in a manner that is consistent with limitations or restrictions under data privacy laws in another state or jurisdiction.
In addition, there are rights offered under some state data privacy laws which we only provide to residents of those states, on or after the effective date of those laws:
Residents of Oregon and Minnesota may request that we identify the third parties to which we have disclosed personal information.
Residents of some states with data privacy laws may appeal denials of any data subject rights offered to them under their state’s data privacy law.
With reference to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, we allow California residents to opt out of the disclosure of personal information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To exercise that opt-out option,

.
NOTE: The information you submit in a privacy rights request form must match the information you used when you opened your account. If we are unable to match the information submitted to the information we have collected, we may not be able to fulfill your request.
If a request is submitted in a manner that is not one of the designated methods for submission, or if the request is deficient in some manner unrelated to our verification process, we will provide you with specific directions on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with the request, as applicable.
If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.
PTC will not discriminate against consumers for exercising any of the rights described herein. This includes denying goods or services, charging different prices, or providing a different level or quality of service. However, PTC can offer consumer’s different rates (or service) if that difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. See our Notice of Financial Incentive below for more information.
Identity Verification
PTC will process certain individual rights requests only after your identity can be verified. Please note that there may be instances where access to your PI may be restricted by law or by our policy to respond to requests made by residents of states without a data privacy law in a manner consistent with existing state data privacy laws. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may request additional information for the express purpose of validating your identity. If we do not fulfil your request for the disclosure of all or some of your PI, we will advise you of the specific reasons for restricting access, barring any legal or regulatory limitations.
After submitting the request form for requests other than opt-out requests, you will be asked to electronically verify your identity. If you complete verification successfully, your request becomes live in the Privacy Portal. If you are unsuccessful at the initial verification attempt, PTC may require you to submit additional information, such as first name, last name, date of birth, address, phone number, or email address. Once verified, the Privacy Office will begin to process your request.
Access Rights – Requests to Know
The Right to Access Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold
You have the right to request that PTC disclose the PI we collected about you. Upon the receipt of a verified request and in accordance with our data retention practice, we will provide the following:

We will not disclose Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, other government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, health insurance numbers, medical identification numbers, account passwords, and security questions and answers.

Please note that the provision of certain benefits of the loyalty program results in the disclosure or “sale” of certain personal information to support rewards and other loyalty program operations.
Unless you expressly opt out of the use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms, we may disclose (sell/share) your personal information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral/targeted advertising. Specifically, we may disclose your IP address, browser information and other device information relating to your interaction with our Electronic Platform.

If you are not a Loyalty member and do not wish to become one, you can opt in by going to our website and enabling all options in your cookie selections.
Authorized Agents
Authorized Agents may submit opt-out requests for consumers under several state data privacy laws; this is not an option that is available under the laws in Iowa, Texas, Utah, or Virginia.  Authorized Agents may submit all types of data subject requests on behalf of a California resident; they may not submit requests other than opt-out requests on behalf of residents of other states. To submit a request as an Authorized Agent on behalf of a consumer, please contact our Privacy Office at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com
.
If you are a California resident and you use an agent to request access to, deletion, or correction of your personal information, the agent will need to provide us with your signed permission indicating the agent has been authorized to submit the request on your behalf. We will also require that you verify your identity directly with us or confirm with us that you provided the agent with permission to submit the request. We may deny a request from an Authorized Agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the consumer to act on their behalf.
When We Do Not Act on a Request – Appeal Process
In some cases, we may not act on your verified requests (e.g., if we cannot do so under other laws that apply). When this is the case, we will explain our reasons for not providing you with the information or taking the action (e.g., correcting data) you requested.
Additionally, residents of some states with data privacy laws may have the right to appeal our decision by contacting us at
privacy@pilotflyingj.com
within 30 days after your receipt of our decision. Please provide us with the case ID number and the full name exactly as submitted on the original request.
Precise Geolocation Opt-Out
If you wish to opt-out of precise geolocation for the purpose of locating nearby travel centers and corresponding fuel pricing online or through the myRewards Plus mobile app, you must do so by disabling precise geolocation in your device settings.
Opt-out Preference Signals
An opt-out preference signal is sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism on behalf of consumers and communicates a consumer’s choice to opt out of the sale and sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising with all businesses that recognize the signal, without having to make individualized requests. The signal can be set on certain browsers or through opt-out plug-in tools.
