SCRIPTURE APP PRIVACY POLICY
Grace Ministries produces and publishes Bible Study (Scripture) Apps in many languages of the world. The Scripture App Privacy Policy is to help you understand what, if any, data we collect as a result of you using the App and what we do with that data.
WHAT ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE DOES THE SCRIPTURE APP NEED?
Scripture Apps needs access to read/write to your deviceâ€™s storage (memory) space, including memory cards, e.g., SD card. This allows for a download of the audio reading of the Scriptures to be stored on the local device and played while the App is running. The user has the option to give permissions for this to happen or not.
WHAT INFORMATION MIGHT WE COLLECT?
Any Scripture App may or may not collect the following type of non-personally identifiable information:
- Type of device (e.g. Samsung S3).
- Version of operating system (e.g. Android 4.2).
- City/Country where connected to internet (e.g. Nairobi, Kenya).
- Book(s) read.
- If analytics for the app is enabled and the device is connected to the internet,
the app will connect from time to time to send usage information
to a Google Analytics account.
- If the app does not connect to the internet, the analytic data is not collected.
Scripture Apps do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). PII is any information regarding a natural person, a legal person, an institution or an association, which is, or can be, identified, even indirectly, by reference to any other information, including a personal identification number.
WHAT DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR?
Any information we collect from you may be used primarily to gauge how many people use the App and where they are using it. Secondarily, it may be used to improve our Application to better support our users, wherever in the world they are located.
HOW DO WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. This includes internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store data.
DO WE DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer data we collect to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties to assist us in operating our Scripture App store, conducting our work, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep all information confidential.
