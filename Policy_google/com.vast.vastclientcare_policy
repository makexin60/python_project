Product Owner at Global Trade Services Company
ISV ( India / Washington DC )
As a Program Manager on behalf of my company, I worked closely with VAST for nearly three years on various challenging projects. We chose to partner with VAST because of their extensive technical expertise and the ability to adapt to the rapidly changing technology landscape. The executive team at VAST exhibited strong technical mastery and competency, setting a high standard for the entire team. Unlike typical Indian IT companies that solely fulfil outsourcing requirements, VAST positioned itself as a technology partner and solution provider. This approach played a crucial role in the successful development of a sophisticated, stable, and highly scalable SAAS platform within a relatively short timeframe. It was a privilege to work with the talented and dedicated team at VAST.
