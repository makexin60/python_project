Opera Privacy Statement
Last updated: February 14, 2025
Introduction
This privacy statement describes how we use data in our browsers, websites, and services. Some of the data we use is considered “personal data” under applicable law. However, even when we use personal data, we generally have no way of actually identifying you as an individual, and our users are essentially anonymous to us.
The specific categories of data that we collect, use, or otherwise process can vary from product to product, from one purpose to another, and in some cases based on your location. This privacy statement sets out when, how, and why we process your data (including but not limited to personal data), as well as your rights under applicable law.
Definitions
First, let’s define some key terms. Many of these definitions are adapted (with changes) from the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”), the data privacy law which applies in the European Union as well as in Norway. We use the GDPR as a guidepost because it applies directly to our European companies and because we believe it sets the highest legal standard for user privacy. However, in some cases we have simplified definitions here for the purpose of clarity.
Personal data:
“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” as the GDPR says. This includes data such as your IP address, device IDs, advertising IDs, and location. Below where we describe how we process personal data, we also list the specific purpose for doing so, as well as our legal basis under the GDPR (as those terms are defined below).
Data controller:
The person or company that decides whether and how to process personal data.
Data processor:
Someone who processes personal data on behalf of a data controller.
Legal basis:
the specific legal grounds we use for processing personal data. The GDPR sets out six specific grounds for processing personal data. The ones most relevant to our Applications are as follows:
Consent:
When we process personal data based on your consent, that means you’ve expressly given us permission to do so.
Contractual grounds:
When we process personal data because it is necessary to perform a contract, for example to provide you with a service as described in our Terms of Service or some other agreement.
Legitimate interest:
When we process personal data based on legitimate interest, that means we have some use for the personal data (such as monetization, or ensuring that products work properly) which is in balance with your right to privacy.
Legal compliance:
In some instances it is necessary for us to process personal data in order to fulfill other obligations under the law, for example detecting fraud, making sure you are who you say you are, etc.
Applications:
the specific apps we offer, as mentioned below, including our desktop and mobile browsers.
Monetization:
making money. Nearly all of our Applications are free to download and use. Therefore we monetize our products in various ways, mostly by selling advertising within the Applications themselves. The money we make helps us keep the lights on, pay the salaries of our staff, and continue developing the most innovative, independent browsers on the market. However, when we monetize our Applications, we never sell our users’ personal data to anyone.
Purpose:
the specific reason or reasons we have for processing personal data.
Process or processing:
collecting or using personal data. As defined in the GDPR, the word “processing” can mean doing almost anything with personal data. Below we have used it in this general sense when we have a general meaning in mind, and used more specific terms (like “store” or “share”) where appropriate.
Retention / retain:
the time period for which we will continue to store data. In general, we do not process or store personal data longer than needed and therefore delete it after a certain period of time. Below we have included some more specific details on retention periods, which vary depending on the type of personal data at issue and the purpose for which it is processed.
Transfer:
Personal data is “transferred” when it is sent or made permanently available to someone or some company outside the European Economic Area (or EEA - that is the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
Opera Group:
Our affiliated group of companies, including Opera Norway AS (a Norwegian company) which develops and publishes the Opera browsers, as well as other subsidiaries and affiliated companies around the world. For more information, see below.
Applications
The kinds of data (including personal data) that we process vary a great deal depending on which applications you use. You can read more about how each of our products processes data below.
Desktop Browsers
The following sections describe how we process data (including, but not limited to personal data) in our desktop applications – Opera browser for Computers (on Windows, Mac, and Linux) and Opera GX desktop (on Windows and Mac).
Opera Account
None of our browsers require that you sign in before you can start using them. However, you have the option to create an
Opera account
to use certain services (like commenting on our Forum or blogs, VPN Pro, Loomi, Cashback, etc.). Again, you do not have to create an Opera account to use our browser applications for regular browsing activities, such as browsing the web.
If you choose to create an
Opera account
, we ask for a preferred username and an email address. The email address will be used to identify you as a user and for password recovery. Alternatively, you can use your Google, Facebook, Twitter, or VK account to sign in to an Opera account and access our services with the same profile. In this case we may collect information such as your name, profile picture, and email address from these social networks. If you use your Opera account in conjunction with a service like VPN Pro or Cashback, the data we process in connection with those services will be associated with your Opera account.
You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your
profile page
. We retain your data for seven days after you’ve decided to discontinue your Opera account in case you choose to change your mind. Your Opera account with a verified email address will be deleted automatically if you don’t sign in for two years. Accounts with unverified email addresses will be deleted after six months of inactivity.
Note also that Opera allows you to sync your browser data, such as Speed Dial entries and bookmarks, between devices that have another Opera browser installed on them. The synced data is retained until your Opera account is deleted.
Purpose:

Personalized Content
Our browsers may include personalized content features, such as a native newsfeed, or specialty content features such as Shopping Corner. When you interact with these features, we collect some information, such as the articles you read in the newsfeed, and your general location. We use this information to build a profile of your interests, which we use to select more relevant content for you. This information is linked to a randomly generated ID and may be stored on our servers for up to three months. We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to withdraw your consent, you can go to the settings menu and disable personalized content.

When you install an Opera application, a random installation ID is generated. We collect this identifier, as well as Machine ID, hardware specifications (model, release date, etc.), operating system, environment configuration, and feature usage data to improve our products and services. For example, we may use it to analyze how our users interact with our applications, or to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, or to detect and debug problems.

You can opt out of reporting extended statistics through the settings menu and choosing not to “Help Opera”.
Purpose:
Improving our products.
Legal Basis:
Legitimate interest (debugging and improving products and services).
Crash Reports and Logs
If an Opera application crashes, we collect a log that includes some information about your browser’s version, your operating system, platform and some memory data related to the crash. We collect this data with the sole purpose of improving our products and services. Crash logs are kept for up to five months. You can opt out of reporting this data to us through the settings menu of the browser.

Browser Assistant checks if any notifications are pending on a scheduled basis and may report occurrences of certain system events (such as low battery, low hard disk space, new Wi-Fi network connected, another browser installed). Browser Assistant collects this data, as well as a randomly generated Opera ID so that we can determine and evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the notifications that we display to users. We may retain this data for up to four years. You can opt out of this data collection via your browser settings by selecting not to help improve Opera.

We use a fraud prevention framework (including Google Safe Browsing) to check the URLs you visit against lists of known, malicious websites to protect you online. We do not process any personal data in this context.
Search Providers
Opera browsers allow you to customize the search engine used in the browser address bar. In most cases Google is the default provider, but other providers (such as Bing) might be set as default based on which version of the Application you are using. You can always change your default provider in the settings menu. Opera does not share personal data with search engine providers to enable search within Opera browsers.
Just like any other third-party website you might access, use of any search engine is subject to the terms of service and privacy policy offered by the specific search engine provider. Some of the web search services available in the Application may be provided by partners of CodeFuel Ltd. including, for example, bing.com. For information on the web search services data collection, please visit the search provider’s privacy policy.
Personalized Ads & Profiling
Based on data such as IP address, hashed user ID, and your general location, some of our Applications serve targeted ads. These ads are provided by our monetization partners. You can always adjust your personalized ad choices in the application’s “Settings” menu or through your operating system’s settings.
As noted in our End User License Agreements for
computers
,
mobiles
and
Terms of Service
, our applications are generally provided for free and as such are ad-supported. Collecting this information helps us offset the costs of our business and helps provide a more personalized experience for the user.
We may also combine this data with other elements – including categories of websites you search and visit, device information (model, release date, device IDs, hardware specifications, operating system, etc.), and categories of ads you have clicked on in our products - to build a better understanding of what our users are interested in. We do not log or store your entire browsing history for this purpose. Instead we simply make a record of whether you have visited certain categories of websites based on the domains of pages you visit and mix it with other data (which might depend on which application you use, and may include page loads, number of SpeedDial clicks, whether you have ad blocker enabled or not, etc.) to make an informed guess about whether you are interested in broad categories of interests (such as sports, gaming, news, etc.). We then add this basic profile to other data, such as your general location (country or city) in order to enable our advertising partners to target their ads to groups of users who might be interested in their products and services. We do not share your personal interests or browsing history with anyone. We retain this data for up to one year after which it is deleted automatically.
We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to view your options, or to withdraw your consent, please visit the settings menu of the application you are using.

Some Speed Dials are ads provided by our advertising partners. If you choose to use Opera’s default Speed Dials, you may be redirected through Opera’s partners or other third parties. These partners and third parties may collect data from you independently of Opera. This data may include third party cookies, device IDs, and session statistics. If you wish to opt out of such data collection, you can easily configure your browser’s Cookie Settings to reject third party cookies. You may also choose not to receive Speed Dial suggestions, or to adjust your Speed Dials by deleting preset options based on your own preference.
Promotion & Marketing
We process some data in order to promote and market our products and services. Some of this data comes directly from you when you submit it to us for some specific purpose. For example, if you decide to provide feedback to Opera, or participate in a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, organized by Opera or our partners on behalf of Opera, we may ask for information such as your name, age, phone number, email, or postal address. Depending on the nature of the campaign or contest, it may be necessary to share your data with third parties. When that applies, we will make it clear in the terms applicable to the campaign.
If you agree to receive marketing information from Opera via email, SMS, or push notifications, we may use third-party technology providers to deliver such messages to you. You can opt-out from marketing communication at any time in your Opera account profile settings or directly from a marketing email you received.
If you submit your phone number or email address on an application download page, we may send you a download link via SMS or email for your convenience.
In Opera for Windows computers, we may use the Browser Assistant component to promote the browser and its features to you. Browser Assistant comes as part of the Opera Browser for Windows, and may be manually removed from the system’s startup list, or via the browser settings. To learn more about Browser Assistant, please read our dedicated section on it in this statement.
In general when we process data in the context of a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, we process your personal data on the basis that doing so is necessary to enable you to participate in the campaign. In some cases we process data for marketing purposes based on your consent. In any case we will not retain your data any longer than necessary to fulfill the specific purpose for which it was collected to begin with. You can always control your preferences via the settings menu or through your account, and if you have other concerns you can reach out to us

When you choose to use the Cashback program and visit supported websites, we will collect merchant URLs, a list of your purchased items, transaction amounts, and IP address. This data is required for the Cashback service to function, and we also use it to provide more relevant partner deals, and to detect fraud and misuse of the service. To enable payouts, your
Opera account
will be linked with a payment service provider, which will share your customer ID, and relevant payment related data with Opera. Your payment data may be stored for up to five years due to regulatory requirements. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your
profile page
. Your Cashback data will be automatically deleted after two years of inactivity. You may choose to delete your Cashback account, which will erase your personal data from the system, through the Account Setting menus in Cashback account.
Purpose:
To provide and improve the service.
Legal Basis:
Contractual grounds, legal compliance.
Malicious-site Check
We use a fraud prevention framework and check the URLs you visit against lists of known, malicious websites to protect you online. We do not process any personal data in this context.
Search Providers
Opera browsers allow you to customize the search engine used in the browser address bar. In most cases Google is the default provider, but other providers (such as Bing) might be set as default based on which version of the Application you are using. You can always change your default provider in the settings menu. Opera does not share personal data with search engine providers to enable search within Opera browsers.
Just like any other third-party website you might access, use of any search engine is subject to the terms of service and privacy policy offered by the specific search engine provider. Some of the web search services available in the Application may be provided by partners of CodeFuel Ltd. including, for example, bing.com. For information on the web search services data collection, please visit the search provider’s privacy policy.
Usage Statistics
When you install an Opera application, a random installation ID is generated. We collect this identifier, as well as Device ID, hardware specifications (model, release date, etc.), operating system, environment configuration, and feature usage data to improve our products and services. For example, we may use it to analyze how our users interact with our applications, or to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, or to detect and debug problems. We have no practical way of using this information to identify you personally. We retain this usage data for up to three years. You can opt out of reporting extended statistics through the settings menu and choosing not to “Help Opera”.
Purpose:
Improving our products.
Legal Basis:
Legitimate interest (debugging and improving products and services).
Personalized Ads & Profiling
Based on data such as Advertising ID, News Client ID, general location, and device information, some of our Applications serve targeted ads. These ads are provided by our monetization partners. You can always adjust your personalized ad choices in the application’s “Settings” menu or through your operating system’s settings.
As noted in our End User License Agreements for
computers
and
mobiles
, and
Terms of Service
, our applications are generally provided for free and as such are ad-supported. Collecting this information helps us offset the costs of our business and helps provide a more personalized experience for the user.
We may also combine this data with other elements – including categories of websites you search and visit, device information (model, release date, device IDs, hardware specifications, operating system, etc.), and categories of ads you have clicked on in our products - to build a better understanding of what our users are interested in. We do not log or store your entire browsing history for this purpose. Instead we simply make a record of whether you have visited certain categories of websites based on the domains of pages you visit and mix it with other data (which might depend on which application you use, and may include page loads, number of SpeedDial clicks, whether you have ad blocker enabled or not, etc.) to make an informed guess about whether you are interested in broad categories of interests (such as sports, gaming, news, etc.). We then add this basic profile to other data, such as your general location (country or city) in order to enable our advertising partners to target their ads to groups of users who might be interested in their products and services. We do not share your personal interests or browsing history with anyone. We retain this data for up to one year after which it is deleted automatically.
We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to view your options, or to withdraw your consent, please visit the settings menu of the application you are using.

These partners and third parties may collect data from you independently of Opera. This data may include third party cookies, device IDs, and session statistics. If you wish to opt out of such data collection, you can easily configure your browser’s Cookie Settings to reject third party cookies. You may also choose not to receive Speed Dial suggestions, or to adjust your Speed Dials by deleting preset options based on your own preference.
Promotion & Marketing
We process some data in order to promote and market our products and services. Some of this data comes directly from you, when you submit it to us for some specific purpose. For example, if you decide to provide feedback to Opera or participate in a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, organized by Opera or our partners on behalf of Opera, we may ask for information such as your name, age, phone number, email, or postal address. Depending on the nature of the campaign or contest, it may be necessary to share your data with third parties. When that applies, we will make it clear in the terms applicable to the campaign.
If you agree to receive marketing information from Opera via email, SMS, or push notifications, we may use third-party technology providers to deliver such messages to you. You can opt-out from marketing communication at any time in your user profile settings or directly from a marketing email you receive.
If you submit your phone number or email address on an application download page, we may send you a download link via SMS or email for your convenience.
We may display in-app campaigns and promotions of Opera products, services or features through push-notifications. You may disable these notifications through your settings menu.

In some cases we may process data for marketing purposes based on your consent. In any case we will not retain your data any longer than necessary to fulfill the specific purpose for which it was processed to begin with.

NorwayOpera Privacy Statement
Last updated: February 14, 2025
Introduction
This privacy statement describes how we use data in our browsers, websites, and services. Some of the data we use is considered “personal data” under applicable law. However, even when we use personal data, we generally have no way of actually identifying you as an individual, and our users are essentially anonymous to us.
The specific categories of data that we collect, use, or otherwise process can vary from product to product, from one purpose to another, and in some cases based on your location. This privacy statement sets out when, how, and why we process your data (including but not limited to personal data), as well as your rights under applicable law.
Definitions
First, let’s define some key terms. Many of these definitions are adapted (with changes) from the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”), the data privacy law which applies in the European Union as well as in Norway. We use the GDPR as a guidepost because it applies directly to our European companies and because we believe it sets the highest legal standard for user privacy. However, in some cases we have simplified definitions here for the purpose of clarity.
Personal data:
“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” as the GDPR says. This includes data such as your IP address, device IDs, advertising IDs, and location. Below where we describe how we process personal data, we also list the specific purpose for doing so, as well as our legal basis under the GDPR (as those terms are defined below).
Data controller:
The person or company that decides whether and how to process personal data.
Data processor:
Someone who processes personal data on behalf of a data controller.
Legal basis:
the specific legal grounds we use for processing personal data. The GDPR sets out six specific grounds for processing personal data. The ones most relevant to our Applications are as follows:
Consent:
When we process personal data based on your consent, that means you’ve expressly given us permission to do so.
Contractual grounds:
When we process personal data because it is necessary to perform a contract, for example to provide you with a service as described in our Terms of Service or some other agreement.
Legitimate interest:
When we process personal data based on legitimate interest, that means we have some use for the personal data (such as monetization, or ensuring that products work properly) which is in balance with your right to privacy.
Legal compliance:
In some instances it is necessary for us to process personal data in order to fulfill other obligations under the law, for example detecting fraud, making sure you are who you say you are, etc.
Applications:
the specific apps we offer, as mentioned below, including our desktop and mobile browsers.
Monetization:
making money. Nearly all of our Applications are free to download and use. Therefore we monetize our products in various ways, mostly by selling advertising within the Applications themselves. The money we make helps us keep the lights on, pay the salaries of our staff, and continue developing the most innovative, independent browsers on the market. However, when we monetize our Applications, we never sell our users’ personal data to anyone.
Purpose:
the specific reason or reasons we have for processing personal data.
Process or processing:
collecting or using personal data. As defined in the GDPR, the word “processing” can mean doing almost anything with personal data. Below we have used it in this general sense when we have a general meaning in mind, and used more specific terms (like “store” or “share”) where appropriate.
Retention / retain:
the time period for which we will continue to store data. In general, we do not process or store personal data longer than needed and therefore delete it after a certain period of time. Below we have included some more specific details on retention periods, which vary depending on the type of personal data at issue and the purpose for which it is processed.
Transfer:
Personal data is “transferred” when it is sent or made permanently available to someone or some company outside the European Economic Area (or EEA - that is the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
Opera Group:
Our affiliated group of companies, including Opera Norway AS (a Norwegian company) which develops and publishes the Opera browsers, as well as other subsidiaries and affiliated companies around the world. For more information, see below.
Applications
The kinds of data (including personal data) that we process vary a great deal depending on which applications you use. You can read more about how each of our products processes data below.
Desktop Browsers
The following sections describe how we process data (including, but not limited to personal data) in our desktop applications – Opera browser for Computers (on Windows, Mac, and Linux) and Opera GX desktop (on Windows and Mac).
Opera Account

Opera account
to use certain services (like commenting on our Forum or blogs, VPN Pro, Loomi, Cashback, etc.). Again, you do not have to create an Opera account to use our browser applications for regular browsing activities, such as browsing the web.
If you choose to create an
Opera account

If you use your Opera account in conjunction with a service like VPN Pro or Cashback, the data we process in connection with those services will be associated with your Opera account.
You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your
profile page
. We retain your data for seven days after you’ve decided to discontinue your Opera account in case you choose to change your mind. Your Opera account with a verified email address will be deleted automatically if you don’t sign in for two years. Accounts with unverified email addresses will be deleted after six months of inactivity.

Our browsers may include personalized content features, such as a native newsfeed, or specialty content features such as Shopping Corner. When you interact with these features, we collect some information, such as the articles you read in the newsfeed, and your general location. We use this information to build a profile of your interests, which we use to select more relevant content for you. This information is linked to a randomly generated ID and may be stored on our servers for up to three months. We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to withdraw your consent, you can go to the settings menu and disable personalized content.
Purpose:

Please note that, as described in our Terms of Service, the sidebar messaging services (such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.) offered within Opera are provided by third parties. These services will not collect any data from you through the side-bar tool unless you specifically sign into them and use them. Opera does not collect any data when you use these services.
Free VPN
When you use our free, built-in browser VPN service, we do not log any personal data or other information related to your browsing activity or originating network address. As long as the browser VPN is active, all traffic in the browser is encrypted using strong industry standard encryption.
VPN Pro
Depending on where you live, you may be able to purchase a paid, premium VPN service called VPN Pro.
VPN Pro is provided by a third-party service provider which owns, operates, and maintains the infrastructure which provides the Service. Data communicated through VPN Pro will be encrypted and routed through one of thousands of servers around the world. However, we do not promise that the service is absolutely secure. Despite our best efforts and the best efforts of our provider, criminals or other bad actors may still be able to access your data.
VPN Pro is a no-log service. We do not collect or store records of web pages you visit or links you click on in the servers dedicated for this Service.
To use VPN Pro you need to create and sign in to an Opera account. We use your Opera account to identify you as a valid subscriber to the VPN Pro service. We will share only information required to identify you as a subscriber with our third-party service provider, including a random ID number. We do not share your email, name, or other data or personal data with our third-party service provider.
Purpose:
To provide the service.
Legal Basis:

Opera Privacy Statement
Last updated: February 14, 2025
Introduction
This privacy statement describes how we use data in our browsers, websites, and services. Some of the data we use is considered “personal data” under applicable law. However, even when we use personal data, we generally have no way of actually identifying you as an individual, and our users are essentially anonymous to us.
The specific categories of data that we collect, use, or otherwise process can vary from product to product, from one purpose to another, and in some cases based on your location. This privacy statement sets out when, how, and why we process your data (including but not limited to personal data), as well as your rights under applicable law.
Definitions
First, let’s define some key terms. Many of these definitions are adapted (with changes) from the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”), the data privacy law which applies in the European Union as well as in Norway. We use the GDPR as a guidepost because it applies directly to our European companies and because we believe it sets the highest legal standard for user privacy. However, in some cases we have simplified definitions here for the purpose of clarity.
Personal data:
“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” as the GDPR says. This includes data such as your IP address, device IDs, advertising IDs, and location. Below where we describe how we process personal data, we also list the specific purpose for doing so, as well as our legal basis under the GDPR (as those terms are defined below).
Data controller:
The person or company that decides whether and how to process personal data.
Data processor:
Someone who processes personal data on behalf of a data controller.
Legal basis:
the specific legal grounds we use for processing personal data. The GDPR sets out six specific grounds for processing personal data. The ones most relevant to our Applications are as follows:
Consent:
When we process personal data based on your consent, that means you’ve expressly given us permission to do so.
Contractual grounds:
When we process personal data because it is necessary to perform a contract, for example to provide you with a service as described in our Terms of Service or some other agreement.
Legitimate interest:
When we process personal data based on legitimate interest, that means we have some use for the personal data (such as monetization, or ensuring that products work properly) which is in balance with your right to privacy.
Legal compliance:
In some instances it is necessary for us to process personal data in order to fulfill other obligations under the law, for example detecting fraud, making sure you are who you say you are, etc.
Applications:
the specific apps we offer, as mentioned below, including our desktop and mobile browsers.
Monetization:
making money. Nearly all of our Applications are free to download and use. Therefore we monetize our products in various ways, mostly by selling advertising within the Applications themselves. The money we make helps us keep the lights on, pay the salaries of our staff, and continue developing the most innovative, independent browsers on the market. However, when we monetize our Applications, we never sell our users’ personal data to anyone.
Purpose:
the specific reason or reasons we have for processing personal data.
Process or processing:
collecting or using personal data. As defined in the GDPR, the word “processing” can mean doing almost anything with personal data. Below we have used it in this general sense when we have a general meaning in mind, and used more specific terms (like “store” or “share”) where appropriate.
Retention / retain:
the time period for which we will continue to store data. In general, we do not process or store personal data longer than needed and therefore delete it after a certain period of time. Below we have included some more specific details on retention periods, which vary depending on the type of personal data at issue and the purpose for which it is processed.
Transfer:
Personal data is “transferred” when it is sent or made permanently available to someone or some company outside the European Economic Area (or EEA - that is the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
Opera Group:
Our affiliated group of companies, including Opera Norway AS (a Norwegian company) which develops and publishes the Opera browsers, as well as other subsidiaries and affiliated companies around the world. For more information, see below.
Applications
The kinds of data (including personal data) that we process vary a great deal depending on which applications you use. You can read more about how each of our products processes data below.
Desktop Browsers
The following sections describe how we process data (including, but not limited to personal data) in our desktop applications – Opera browser for Computers (on Windows, Mac, and Linux) and Opera GX desktop (on Windows and Mac).

When you interact with these features, we collect some information, such as the articles you read in the newsfeed, and your general location. We use this information to build a profile of your interests, which we use to select more relevant content for you. This information is linked to a randomly generated ID and may be stored on our servers for up to three months. We process this data based on your consent.

Browser Assistant
Opera for computers on Windows includes a component called Browser Assistant that displays notifications promoting the browser’s features or the browser itself. Browser Assistant checks if any notifications are pending on a scheduled basis and may report occurrences of certain system events (such as low battery, low hard disk space, new Wi-Fi network connected, another browser installed). Browser Assistant collects this data, as well as a randomly generated Opera ID so that we can determine and evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the notifications that we display to users. We may retain this data for up to four years. You can opt out of this data collection via your browser settings by selecting not to help improve Opera.
Purpose:
Improving our products.
Legal Basis:
Legitimate interest (improving our products by understanding effectiveness of notifications of users).
Malicious-site Check
We use a fraud prevention framework (including Google Safe Browsing) to check the URLs you visit against lists of known, malicious websites to protect you online. We do not process any personal data in this context.
Search Providers
Opera browsers allow you to customize the search engine used in the browser address bar. In most cases Google is the default provider, but other providers (such as Bing) might be set as default based on which version of the Application you are using. You can always change your default provider in the settings menu. Opera does not share personal data with search engine providers to enable search within Opera browsers.
Just like any other third-party website you might access, use of any search engine is subject to the terms of service and privacy policy offered by the specific search engine provider. Some of the web search services available in the Application may be provided by partners of CodeFuel Ltd. including, for example, bing.com. For information on the web search services data collection, please visit the search provider’s privacy policy.
Personalized Ads & Profiling
Based on data such as IP address, hashed user ID, and your general location, some of our Applications serve targeted ads. These ads are provided by our monetization partners. You can always adjust your personalized ad choices in the application’s “Settings” menu or through your operating system’s settings.
As noted in our End User License Agreements for
computers
,
mobiles
and
Terms of Service
, our applications are generally provided for free and as such are ad-supported. Collecting this information helps us offset the costs of our business and helps provide a more personalized experience for the user.
We may also combine this data with other elements – including categories of websites you search and visit, device information (model, release date, device IDs, hardware specifications, operating system, etc.), and categories of ads you have clicked on in our products - to build a better understanding of what our users are interested in. We do not log or store your entire browsing history for this purpose. Instead we simply make a record of whether you have visited certain categories of websites based on the domains of pages you visit and mix it with other data (which might depend on which application you use, and may include page loads, number of SpeedDial clicks, whether you have ad blocker enabled or not, etc.) to make an informed guess about whether you are interested in broad categories of interests (such as sports, gaming, news, etc.). We then add this basic profile to other data, such as your general location (country or city) in order to enable our advertising partners to target their ads to groups of users who might be interested in their products and services. We do not share your personal interests or browsing history with anyone. We retain this data for up to one year after which it is deleted automatically.

These partners and third parties may collect data from you independently of Opera. This data may include third party cookies, device IDs, and session statistics. If you wish to opt out of such data collection, you can easily configure your browser’s Cookie Settings to reject third party cookies. You may also choose not to receive Speed Dial suggestions, or to adjust your Speed Dials by deleting preset options based on your own preference.
Promotion & Marketing
We process some data in order to promote and market our products and services. Some of this data comes directly from you when you submit it to us for some specific purpose. For example, if you decide to provide feedback to Opera, or participate in a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, organized by Opera or our partners on behalf of Opera, we may ask for information such as your name, age, phone number, email, or postal address. Depending on the nature of the campaign or contest, it may be necessary to share your data with third parties. When that applies, we will make it clear in the terms applicable to the campaign.
If you agree to receive marketing information from Opera via email, SMS, or push notifications, we may use third-party technology providers to deliver such messages to you. You can opt-out from marketing communication at any time in your Opera account profile settings or directly from a marketing email you received.
If you submit your phone number or email address on an application download page, we may send you a download link via SMS or email for your convenience.

Therefore we will share some data with them to facilitate your use of the service, such as if you choose to make a purchase or an account. To use GX.gear you do not need to create or sign in to a customer account. However, if you decide to do so, you will be asked for your email address and to set up a password.
When submitting your order, you will have to provide us with information necessary for delivery and potential complaints purposes, including such data as: your name, surname, postal address and phone number (optional). We will only share this information with our third-party fulfilment service provider (who may further share it with subcontractors e.g. couriers to deliver your order to you). If your residence is in the United States, this information will be collected by our Merchant of Record - OpenBorder, Inc., (who may further share it with subcontractors e.g. payment providers and couriers to deliver your order to you).
Your payment for the order will be processed by a payment service provider, who may collect and process additional data, including: card number, card expiration date and security code. The payment service provider will share your customer ID and relevant payment-related data with us or OpenBorder in the US. Your payment data may be stored for at least five years due to regulatory requirements. We will retain your data for as long as necessary for the purposes named herein, unless you request their deletion or close your customer account – then we will only keep the data that is necessary to fulfil our legal obligations.

Data Controller & Internal Processing
Opera browsers are developed and published by Opera Norway AS, a company registered under the laws of Norway. Therefore Opera Norway AS acts as the primary data controller for Opera browsers and services.
The Opera Group companies work together to develop our apps, and to market, distribute, and monetize them around the world. In general, the other companies of the Opera Group that may have access to personal data act as data processors for Opera Norway. As a matter of company policy, we apply the GDPR to our internal processing in general, even in contexts where it might not apply directly to our affiliated companies outside of Europe.
