Data retention
Monedata will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

Request transfer of your personal information (“data portability”):
This is where in some circumstances we will provide to you or a third party you have chosen your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Right to withdraw consent:
This is where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. Depending on the processing activity, if you withdraw your consent we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Automated decision making:
This is where decisions are made about you by automated means. We do not carry out automated decision making that results in legal or similarly significant effect.

Carrying out your data subject rights

However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

OUTLOGIC PRIVACY NOTICE
*Please click
HERE
to opt-out of selling your data.
OUTLOGIC LLC a Virginia company (“OUTLOGIC” “we,” “us,” and “our”), provides data services to other companies and organizations, as further described in this privacy notice (“Privacy Notice.”).
This Privacy Notice explains how we collects, uses, stores, and shares personal information about individuals in two different contexts (we refer to such individuals as “you,” “your,” and “yourself”): (1) visitors to our website located at
www.outlogic.io
or (2) when we collect personal information from third parties such as mobile applications (“Apps”). This Privacy Notice also explains certain choices you may have regarding how we use this information about you, as well as rights you may have to access or correct the information we hold and use.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and would like to review your rights under the GDPR, please go to
Section 8
of this Privacy Notice. If you are a resident of California or Virginia or certain other states that have enacted privacy-specific consumer laws, you may review your data privacy rights under those types of state laws at
Section 10
of this Privacy Notice.
Please note that we do not use any precise location data to create or build consumer profiles or targeted audiences in connection with sensitive health based locations, nor do we permit our customers to do so. In addition, to further comply with specific state laws, we use commercially available information to assist in filtering out precise location data for sensitive health based locations in those states.
Below, we explain certain terms that we will use in this Notice that may make it easier to understand:
Advertising ID
: A unique alphanumeric string randomly assigned by operating system manufacturers to a Device. Examples of this include iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs.
Data Aggregators
: Third party data companies that provide data to Outlogic, including personal data and information.
Devices
: Internet-connected mobile devices such as Apple iPhones that use iOS or Samsung Galaxy devices that use Google’s Android OS.
IP Address
: a numeric address in a format that follows the Internet Protocol data rules and that is used to identify a computer, mobile phone, or other device connected to the internet.
Personal Information
: This Policy refers to “Personal Information” and “Personal Data” interchangeably, to mean the types of information/data that applicable laws that use those terms refer to. It includes, for instance, device identifiers, precise location data, name/address, email address, and other unique identifiers that can be associated with them.
Publishers:
Providers of Apps used by Users on Devices.
SDK, or Software Development Kit
: An SDK is a block of computer code that Publishers can integrate with their Apps to collect data, often useful (as in OUTLOGIC’s case) to the mobile advertising and data industries.
Services
: OUTLOGIC’s Services refer to the products and insights we create/provide using location data,
and using and providing IP Addresses
and/or Advertising IDs assigned by Device manufacturers, to companies for marketing and research purposes, for example, to enable their research and personalized advertising. The Services also refer to products and insights we provide using location data and/or Installation IDs assigned to Devices by certain Apps, to companies for research purposes, excluding marketing and personalized advertising. The Services also include the SDK and other similar technologies we may use to collect information.
Site
: Our website that you may visit at
http://www.outlogic.io/
.
Visitors
: Individuals who
visit our website or
choose to provide information directly to us via the OUTLOGIC website “Contact Us” form.
Server to Server App / Server to Server Partner
: OUTLOGIC sometimes partners with certain Publishers or other Data Aggregators, who (in each case) do not use the SDK in favor of sending us information they collect from their Apps using their own SDKs. In other cases, we may obtain the same kinds of information using server-to-server transfers instead of collecting information through SDKs.
System Location Services
: Device technologies that allow Apps to access information about your location (such as GPS coordinates).
Installation ID
: A unique alphanumeric string randomly assigned by certain Apps to a Device but which is not used for advertising purposes.
App Tracking Transparency/Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads
: Features on iOS or Android Devices that allow Users to disable, or limit Apps’ ability to access, the Device Advertising ID. On iOS phones, users who do not give Apps permission to track zeroes out the Advertising ID. On Android phones running Android 12 or newer, users whom Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads zeroes out the Advertising ID.
A. Summary: Who is OUTLOGIC?
OUTLOGIC is a platform for collecting, aggregating, licensing and managing data. In particular, we focus on the curation and use of high-quality location data to help provide insights to organizations of various kinds regarding patterns of peoples’ movements. Our platform assists a variety of businesses and organizations in understanding movement patterns and trends for purposes including marketing and advertising, financial research, market research, traffic and urban planning, smart cities, or educational purposes. Certain government entities or public health organizations may also use our platform, including for purposes of public health research and planning, information security, physical security, to prevent crime, or for civic and traffic planning. (Our specific data licensing practices may vary depending on geographic region).
2. What Types of Information Do We Collect?
A. Information We Collect Through Our Services
We collect information using our SDK. This information may include Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, location information (described more fully below), and other information pertaining to the way Devices and their users engage with mobile advertising services. We also collect the same types of information using Server to Server transfers. We also collect information (including location information) from Publishers to assist them in meeting revenue goals for their Apps, allowing them to provide media, games, and other mobile apps, such as weather or traffic apps, without charging their users. We also may collect and use information from Apps owned by OUTLOGIC affiliated companies.
Publishers can use our SDK with their Apps in order to enhance advertisers’ ability to show ads in Publisher Apps (including to target more relevant ads and to measure ad performance). App Publishers may also work with us to monetize their App content in other ways we describe in this Privacy Policy. (If you would like to opt-out of our use of the Advertising ID on your Device for these purposes, please take the steps explained in
Section 6
below, entitled “User Choices and Opt-Out Tools”).
When you use an App or OUTLOGIC App on your Device that has integrated with our Services (including the SDK), we can collect certain information through or about your Device, if you have granted access to (and you have not later opted-out of our use of) location services and an Advertising ID or Installation ID. In particular (but not exclusively):
Precise Location Information
:
Specific geolocation of the Device, usually described by latitude-longitude coordinates compiled through GPS features of our SDK, WiFi connection information, cell tower triangulation and other methods.
Dwell time within or in proximity to points of interest (i.e. the length of time your device stayed at one place).
Relative Location Information
:
Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) sensors, or beacons,
Information obtained from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Near-field Communication (NFC)
Our SDK is capable of receiving signals from each of the above technologies that indicate the proximity of a Device. For example, certain brick-and-mortar stores use beacons that sense when a Bluetooth-enabled Device is in proximity to the beacon (i.e., when a Device user enters the store). Retail locations, sports arenas, restaurants, museums and other similar businesses may also use beacons.
Advertising IDs or Installation IDs
Timestamps
(that may include time and date)
Device Event Information
:
App or system crashes
System crashes
Device settings
Device Usage Information
Type of device (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S21)
Operating system (OS) information (e.g., iOS 14.5)
System settings (e.g., enabled/disabled status for Location Services)
Time zone
Mobile carrier
IP address
Names and/or identifiers for Apps on your Device integrated with SDK
Network Information
VPN status
Network protocols employed
Device connectivity information (e.g., how a device connects to a network) and signal strength
Network information such as mobile network code and mobile country code

3. How We Use The Information We Collect Through Our Services
When we collect information through the Services, OUTLOGIC
or its customers who receive the data
may use it for any of the following purposes:
To Make Inferences based on collected data, including movement patterns and research
:
Movement Patterns
: To make inferences regarding the location and movement patterns of individuals or devices. For example, we might record location data from Devices at certain points of interest over time, like shows, sporting events, restaurants, etc., and we may include this information in the Services.
Data Products
: To use these location-based observations with other data products. For example, we may add other information to the location data we collect such as the name of a venue, time spent at a point of interest, or other information to a set of Advertising IDs or Installation IDs to enhance user profiles or to enable decision-making based on that information, such as executing a stock trade.
Advertising and Research
: For advertising and research purposes, such as use by advertising technology platforms who use the information to provide similar capabilities. The information helps these platforms to make predictions and generate insights about trends in consumer or market behavior, or to conduct scientific research in connection with human movement patterns.
Smart Cities and Security
: Real estate developers, urban planners, government entities, or security or smart city businesses may use and augment the information to tailor it to their needs. We also license the information to assist businesses and governments with planning, physical security, information security, and preventing crime.
Interest-Based Audiences and Targeting Ads
:
Interest-Based-Audiences
: We use the information we collect to organize Device users into audience segments based on their inferred interests (for example, that a Device user is interested in attending sporting events, or certain kinds of retail stores). This enables our Clients to deliver advertising to those users when they are recognized on their own platforms.
Targeting Ads
: By using audience segments, advertisers increase their chances of sending an ad that is more likely to be relevant.
Ad Measurement
:
Ad Measurement Analysis
: We use information we collect (such as location information and Advertising IDs) to assist advertisers with analyzing ad campaign performance – for example, by measuring how (or whether) Devices that were served with a particular ad engaged with the advertiser’s products or services. This is sometimes called ad measurement or attribution analysis.
An example of ad measurement analysis would be if certain Devices were served with an advertisement for “OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop” on Wednesday, and location data then showed traffic at OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop on Thursday or Friday was higher than average, OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop might conclude that its ad campaign performed well.
Publisher Analysis
:
Analysis and Compliance
: We assist our Publisher partners with analyzing how Users engage with the Publishers’ Apps, and in activating that information for advertising, to generate revenue, and to enhance App functionality.
We may also use this information to provide Publishers with options for complying with certain laws, regulations, and other rules where applicable.
To learn more about how we collect, use and share information pertaining to our Site visitors, please refer to
Section 5
.
4. How Do We Use Information We Collect From Visitors?
We may use information we collect about Visitors for our corporate and internal purposes, including:
Analyzing what products and services Visitors may be interested in, the popularity of different pages of our Site, as well as how Visitors interact with our Site in other ways. If you give your personal contact information to us (e.g., your email address), we may combine that information with other information described in
Section 2
to understand how to better serve you.
To communicate with Visitors, including to offer customer or Visitor support for the Site or the Services. For example, we may use your personal information solely for purposes of replying to your questions when you use the “Contact Us” form on the Site.
Market research.
Direct and online targeted marketing in accordance with applicable law. For instance, we may “retarget” ads about our services to those who have visited our website.
To improve, maintain, operate, and personalize the Site.
For human resource purposes.
For any other legitimate purpose upon proper notice and/or consent.
5. With Whom Do We Share Information We Collect?
We share the information we collect for purposes of operating our platform (for example, with our service providers) and for purposes of supporting the business of our customers. We may share information we collect from your Device as follows:

. OUTLOGIC is not responsible for these Clients’ or any third parties’ privacy policies or opt-out programs or their compliance with NAI requirements.
With Our Service Providers
:
We have contracts with businesses that assist us with our own business operations (e.g., our Site, database hosting, fraud detection and prevention, verification and reporting, data hygiene, human resources, marketing and advertising, and email services), as well as billing or accounting functions, collections, technology, and other forms of operational support.
With Our Affiliates
:
In the event we establish a subsidiary or otherwise become affiliated with another company, we may share any information that we have collected with those entities.
In Relation to Legal Proceedings or Process
:
We may share information we have collected when we have a legal obligation to do so. This may include compliance with a binding court order, exercising, establishing or defending OUTLOGIC’s legal rights, or those of Clients or any other third party, or in good faith to comply with the requirements of any applicable law or legal process.
Similarly, we may disclose any information we have collected as required to respond in good faith to legal process, including subpoenas (whether civil or criminal), court orders or search warrants.
To Investigate Malfeasance and to Defend Ourselves or Third Parties
:
We may share information to assist us in enforcing our legal rights, our Terms of Service, or other policies as applicable, or to investigate any potential violation of the same. We may also share information to investigate any potential violations of the law, to defend or protect ourselves, our Clients, or any third party from any potential harm (whether tangible or intangible).
In Relation to a Corporate Transaction
:
If a third party seeks to acquire or actually acquires our business or assets in whole or in part, we may disclose information we have collected in connection to that transaction (including without limitation during due diligence that may be undertaken in advance of possible sales).
6. User Choices & Opt-Out Tools
You can manage the way that we use data collected passively from your Device in connection with the OUTLOGIC Site and the Services (e.g. Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, or cookies) as described below:

or the
DAA’s Consumer Choice Page
. Residents of the EEA, UK and Switzerland may refer to
www.youronlinechoices.com
. The opt-out tools provided on these industry pages are generally based on cookie technologies. As such, if you delete your cookies (or change or update your web browser) you will need to repeat the opt out process. While our Services are generally not based on cookie technology, we are providing this information because we may partner with businesses to tailor ads for our own Services that do (for example, to retarget Visitors of Sites with advertisements). Further, certain third-party platforms may use information we have collected to match identifiers across devices – such as to tie a mobile Advertising ID by common IP Address to a browser-based cookie ID.

7. Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect our physical infrastructure as well as in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks. These measures are intended to protect our systems (and the information contained therein) from loss, misappropriation, misuse, alteration or disclosure. No method of electronic transmission or storage is perfectly secure, however, so we cannot guarantee the security of information we collect with absolute certainty.
8.
The European Union and UK and Protections Under European Privacy Laws (GDPR and UK GDPR)
We (and those using our Services) are required to provide certain information about the processing of “Personal Data” of users in EEA and Switzerland under the GDPR of users in the UK under the UK GDPR. For purposes of this explanation, we will refer to both as “GDPR.” “Personal Data” generally refers to data that identifies or is capable of identifying a particular user or Device. Names and addresses, cookie IDs, Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, precise location information, and biometric data are examples of “Personal Data.”
If you have any questions about OUTLOGIC’s processing of Personal Data in the context of the GDPR, You may contact our Chief Privacy Officer by emailing your questions to
privacy@outlogic.io
, or contact our EU Representative at
eurep@outlogic.io
.
The representations and information we provide below, which are applicable only to individuals located in the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, are provided for purposes of compliance with the GDPR. Please do not rely on the information below if you are not located in one of those regions.
Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data:
Under the GDPR, we must disclose the legal bases we rely on to process Personal Data. Our legal bases for processing Personal Data for the purposes we describe in
Section 2
and
Section 3
above and
Section 5
as to our corporate data) include:
Consent
. We rely on your consent to provide our Services that use precise location information related to other Personal Data. We also rely on your consent to store and access information on your Device (e.g., Advertising IDs and Installation IDs). Our reliance on consent is in turn often in reliance on compliance steps required of and taken by our data suppliers and by Clients that use the Services. These steps are intended to confirm that your consent is collected in compliance with the GDPR and passed on to Clients and business partners such that we only facilitate the collection of data in compliance with the law. We may rely on your consent to process Personal Data in other circumstances as well. When we do so, we will follow applicable laws pertaining to providing and withdrawing consent. We also attempt to obtain consent for certain of our clients to process Personal Data. These Clients, in turn, may be independent data controllers as to data in their own possession and control.
Legitimate interest
. We may rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data in some cases. We may do so when we use Personal Data for purposes of maintaining the security of our services (including to detect and prevent fraud or to facilitate the detection and correction of bugs or other errors). We also rely on legitimate interest when we use our own Clients’ Personal Data (or our Site Visitors’ Personal Data) to communicate with them about their use of our Services, or to analyze user activity on our Site.
Contractual Agreements
. In some cases our basis for processing Personal Data is that the processing is necessary pursuant to a contractual relationship we have entered into (such as records and contact information related to our Clients).
You may obtain a copy of our SCCs document by contacting us at
privacy@outlogic.io
.
Legal Obligations
. We may process Personal Data when it is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
Transfers of Personal Data:
When we collect Personal Data in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, and then transfer it outside of those jurisdictions, we take measures to ensure that such Personal Data is protected by appropriate safeguards. In general, our transfers of Personal Data rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and Data Processing Agreements to safeguard that data where the GDPR or other European data protection laws require it. You may use the contact information below to request a copy of these SCCs.
How We Retain Personal Data
: We generally retain Personal Data we collect for as long as is necessary to either (1) provide our Services (absent a deletion or opt-out request); or (2) for other purposes including compliance with our legal obligations, dispute resolution, and to enforce our contracts. Our schedule for retaining Advertising IDs, Installation IDs,
and related location data
is as follows: Advertising IDs and Installation IDs we collect in order to provide our Services are rendered inactive by us within 12 months after the time we last obtained your consent; however, we may retain data beyond 13 months where we have de-identified it (i.e., altered it in such a way that it cannot be linked to Personal Data). We may retain this (and other) information insofar as we have a legal or operational need to do so, for example, for purposes of auditing, corporate record-keeping, legal compliance, accounting, security and bug-prevention purposes.
Rights of Data Subjects:
Data Subjects have certain rights in connection with the Personal Data that data controllers process about them pursuant to the GDPR. These include the right to access Personal Data, the right to request correction of inaccurate Personal Data, the right to request the restriction of processing of Personal Data, the right to request deletion of Personal Data, and the right to object to processing of Personal Data (including when we process Personal Data to build a profile for targeted digital advertising). We describe these rights more fully below.
Right to Access
: You may contact us at
privacy@outlogic.io
in order to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller. We will respond to your request by explaining the steps you must follow to access your Personal Data after we receive your request. Because we are required to verify the identity of the individual making a request before we provide access to Personal Data, we will evaluate requests to exercise certain rights to access Personal Data on a case-by-case basis. In conducting this evaluation, we may consider both (1) the effort involved in verifying whether Personal Data that we process actually pertains to the data subject making the request – and only to that data subject; and (2) any potentially negative consequences that may result from erroneously releasing Personal Data to an individual other than the data subject, in light of the sensitivity of the Personal Data at issue and the degree of certainty we can achieve through verification. We may also limit the amount or kind of Personal Data we will release in circumstances where we believe it is likely that the improper release of Personal Data would adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the data subject. We will only honor requests for access to Personal Data for which we act as a data controller, as explained more fully in sub-section (d) below. Where we act as a processor for Personal Data on behalf of another entity (for example, our Clients), you may contact that company instead of OUTLOGIC to make a data access request.
Right to Correct
: You may exercise your right to correct Personal Data by contacting us using the contact information provided below.
Right to Withdraw your Consent or Object to our Personal Data Processing
: You may use the opt-out methods described in
Section 6
of this Privacy Notice to withdraw your consent for our processing of your Personal Data (when we are relying on your consent). If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your Personal Data in connection with our Services within 30 days or fewer.
Right to Request Deletion
: You have the right to request that we delete Personal Data concerning you that we process as a controller. If you use the opt-out process described above, we will also delete your Personal Data. You may also contact us at
privacy@outlogic.io
to request that we delete your Personal Data. We will provide further instructions on how you can exercise your right to deletion after we receive your email request. In certain circumstances we may keep copies of Personal Data in back-up files (or otherwise in inactive form), for certain of our internal purposes that are important to our business, including legal, auditing, accounting and billing, bug-detection and correction. We may keep such backups for as long as is necessary to fulfill those purposes.
Right to Make Complaints
: You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our processing of Personal Data with a relevant data protection authority. If you have a complaint, please contact us first to allow us to assist you in resolving it.
OUTLOGIC may act as either a data controller or a data processor in connection with the Personal Data we process, depending on the circumstances. EU data protection law distinguishes between companies that process Personal Data for their own purposes (i.e. “data controllers”) and companies that process Personal Data on behalf of and at the direction of other organizations (i.e. “data processors”). When we act as a data processor for other organizations, such as for our Clients, we may direct your requests or inquiries to the relevant data controller that is responsible for the processing of your Personal Data.
9. Children’s Data
We do not intend for our Services to be used in connection with minors under the age of 18, and we do not intentionally collect data from them. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected of any such data, please use the contact information provided in
Section 12
below to let us know.
10. Additional Information for U.S. Residents Including Residents of California, Montana, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and other States with Applicable Privacy Rights

We may use Aggregate or De-Identified Information for any purpose, including, but not limited to, for research and marketing purposes. We may also share Aggregate or De-Identified Information with third parties, who may include advertisers or marketers, promotional partners, our sponsors, or otherwise at our discretion.
C. Rights and Choices of US States Residents
If you are a resident of any US state, you have the right to request that we delete personal information collected from you, including data that may reveal your mobile device’s precise geographic location, and also send requests to any recipients of your personal information that they delete such data from their commercial databases (your “deletion rights”). If you choose to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which we may nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as to prevent, detect, or investigate data security incidents, or to protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity directed at the company. The right to delete is separate from the right to opt-out of data sales as provided in Applicable States laws. We describe below how you may exercise your deletion rights.
In addition to data deletion, if you are a resident of an Applicable State, you may have
additional rights including
the right to request (1) that we disclose what personal information we collect from you; and (2) to opt out of our sale of your personal information. The states that provide these rights to their residents include but are not limited to California (under the CCPA), Colorado (under the CPA), Connecticut (under the CTDPA), Utah (under the UCPA), and Virginia (under the VCDPA),
as well as other Applicable States, as we have stated above.
These rights are subject to certain limitations, although you will not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. In certain circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee to process your request to the extent permitted by law.
Right to Opt-out of the Sale of Your Personal Information
:
Residents
of Applicable States
may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. “Sale” is defined broadly by
various state laws,
to include making personal information available in exchange for any monetary or other valuable consideration.
To “opt out” of our “sale” of your personal information you may use either of the methods below:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
By emailing your opt-out request to
privacy@outlogic.io
using a subject line that reads “Data Transfer Opt out.”
Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
:
If we have collected personal information from you, you may request that we delete such personal information. A request to delete is distinct from a request to “opt out” of our sale of your personal information. You may contact us by email at
privacy@outlogic.io
or call us toll-free at +1 (866) 346-9602 to exercise this right.
If you choose to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which we many nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as:
To defend against fraudulent activity directed towards our business, systems, or users.
To detect and fix technical issues that affect existing system functions (e.g., for de-bugging).
As necessary for the protection of the free speech or other rights of us (or others).
To assist with law enforcement requests made pursuant to lawful process.
For certain scientific or historical research purposes.
For our own internal purposes, provided they are reasonably related to your relationship with us.
To comply with our legal obligations.
Please note that we require certain information in order to provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete that information, it may prevent you from being able to access or use our Services.
Opt-Out/Access/Deletion Requests Metrics-2024
From January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, we maintained processes to facilitate requests pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act. We received the following requests, and responded as follows:a. As to requests to know:
We received 10
We complied with 2
We denied 8, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
b. As to requests to delete:
We received 141
We complied with 8
We denied 133, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
c. As to requests to opt out of sale:
We received 543
We complied with 94
We denied 449, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
d. We received an additional 24,800 requests by a purported third-party automated data deletion service. Such requests could not be processed, due to service’s failure to provide the necessary identifying information despite our repeated requests.
Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information
:
Applicable States may give their residents the right to request that we disclose both the categories and specific pieces of personal information that we collect, use, or sell. We will comply with data access requests if we can verify them to a legally sufficient degree. You may make such an access request by emailing us at
privacy@outlogic.io
with the subject line “Data Access Request” or by calling us toll-free at +1 (866) 346-9602.
We may be able to adequately verify access requests for certain information we have collected. However, in line with certain guidance provided by the California Attorney General, we do not provide location data in response to access requests due to the fact that we are not able to verify to a reasonably high degree of certainty that the location data we have collected pertains to the individual making such a request, or whether either an individual with custody of a device — or the person making the request — is the rightful owner of the device to which the information we hold pertains. For example, it is not uncommon for a person to be in possession of another person’s phone temporarily (for example, a partner, friend or work colleague’s mobile phone or tablet), whether or not such temporary possession is authorized. We take this approach in order to avoid a scenario where such a person in temporary possession of a phone might obtain potentially detailed and sensitive information pertaining to the phone’s owner through a request for access. We also believe California law compels us to avoid a scenario like this. In addition, a recent study found that roughly 50% of mobile phones were not password protected at all, making the possibility of such “spoofing” a tangible risk. Further, we do not have other, more conventional means to confirm the identity of a device’s true owner because for consumer privacy reasons we do not collect information such as name, address or email address that could be used to do so.
If you do not wish location data associated with your device to be used in the ways we describe above, we suggest that you make a request to opt out of sales of your information as detailed above. You can find complete information about how to exercise your right to opt out by visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
Our Collection of Sensitive Personal Information, and Your Rights to Limit Its Use
:
Certain Personal Information that we collect and sell, such as precise geolocation of a person, household, or device, is considered “Sensitive Personal Information” under the data privacy laws of California (CCPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), and Virginia (VCDPA)
and other Applicable States
. We obtain the right to use and share this information, through the consent methods described in our Privacy Policy. California residents have the right to require a business to limit the use of their Sensitive Personal Information to only certain internal business purposes specified in the CCPA.
To limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information, you may use either of the methods below:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
Use OUTLOGIC’s web-form available
here
.
By emailing your request to
privacy@outlogic.io
using a subject line that reads “California Limit SPI Use.”
How to Exercise Your Rights and Submit a Verifiable Consumer Request
:
To exercise
applicable privacy
rights or to learn more about how to do so, residents of those
Applicable
States may contact us using any of the following means:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
By emailing your request to
privacy@outlogic.io
.
With respect to access or deletion requests, by calling us toll-free at: +1 (866) 346-9602.
In certain circumstances, we may not disclose some personal information to you in response to an access request where doing so presents too great a risk to you or our business. We may also withhold such information where we cannot verify your identity in connection to such personal information.
To learn about how to opt out of Tailored Advertising, please review and consider whether to use the industry opt-out mechanisms provided on the
NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) page
. We believe that opting out using these industry tools may be more efficient, faster, and more uniform compared to using manual opt out processes.
In the event we are not able to comply with your requests fully for any of the reasons described above, we will still explain the reasons why we could not fulfill your request. Certain consumers have the right to appeal our decision not to fulfill a request, and may do so by emailing our Chief Privacy Officer at
A
ppeals@outlogic.io
with the subject line “Privacy Choices Appeal”.
Right to Non-Discrimination
:
If you elect to exercise your rights
under the Applicable State, as described in this
Section 10
, we will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services for that reason.
Information Regarding Individuals Younger than 16 Years Old
:
Unless we have obtained legally sufficient consent to do so, we do not knowingly sell personal information pertaining to minors younger than 16 years old. In the event we learn that we have collected or sold personal information regarding such residents, we will take reasonable steps to remove such information from our database (or we will obtain any legally required consents).
Authorized Agents
:
You may exercise your rights described above under the
laws of Applicable States
, by designating an agent to make requests on your behalf. If you choose to designate an agent, we will take steps to verify both (1) your identity; and (2) that your designated agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf by providing us
(depending on the legal requirement in your state)
with a written authorization signed by you or a copy of a valid power of attorney.
D. Retention of U.S. Personal Information
We retain personal information pertaining to the categories listed in
Section 10
.A. on the following schedule: device and other identifiers, precise location data, inferences, and internet or other electronic activity information may be retained for up to 5 years, with certain aggregated information related to locations of devices and internal reporting data retained for up to 3 years, to fulfill the business purposes listed in Section II.B. We may maintain personal information for longer periods if we have a significant operational or legal need to do so, such as for auditing, compliance, accounting, security, bug-prevention purposes, and when required by law. For example, we may retain Consent audit logs
for up to 10 years
.

Privacy Policy
Everything you need to know
1. Who we are
This Privacy Policy describes how Teragence Limited (“Teragence”, “we,” “us” or “our”), collects, uses, and shares data (personal data as well as non-personal data, as defined by the GDPR) when you allow us access to data on your device in connection with your use of a mobile application operated by one of our partners (“Partner”).
We request access to data from your handset to measure the availability, signal quality and overall network quality of mobile communication networks (“our Services”), as well as other services such as device and operator market share analysis.
Teragence is responsible for the control and processing of data that we collect from your device. If you have any questions or concerns about Teragence’s use of data, please contact us at info@teragence.com.
This Policy aims to inform you about our privacy practices and to ensure that you understand what data we collect and process and the purposes for which we collect it.
Our mission is to analyse and review the signal quality, availability, service coverage, performance and market share of mobile networks, operators and handsets all over the world. We obtain this data by collecting measurements from users of mobile devices.
2. How we collect and use data
We collect data from your mobile device both when you are using our Partner’s app and when it is closed.
From time to time we collect selected information from your device including location data (which include GPS coordinates or similar information regarding the location of your device), network type, network operator, cellular and WiFi signal strength and quality, and the identifiers of connected cell towers and WiFi routers (including both BSSID and SSID). We also runn small tests which download or upload data within our software. We do not monitor the content of your data or voice usage nor do we monitor where and how much data you consume or who you communicate with.
We do not collect any data on the apps installed on your device or the usage of these apps. The goal of collecting the above data is to measure the quality of the network your device is connected to, assess handset performance and analyse network operator and device market share.
We can also measure some internal device conditions – such as battery and screen state. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how instantaneous device conditions affect experience of mobile networks.
To better understand the impact of devices, we can collect data on your device hardware such as the model, manufacturer, and manufacturers and models of sub-components (such as the cellular radio) and the capabilities of these components (for example the number of cores on the CPU). Similarly, to understand differences caused by software, we can collect information on the mobile platform version used and whether custom ROMs or Android skins are installed. The goal of collecting this data is to understand how device characteristics impact the performance of mobile networks.
We do not collect or transmit any persistent individual identifiers from your device such as MAC-address, IMSI/EMEI code or advertising-ID. We assign your device with its own internally-generated ID, but this ID is stored separately from the measurements we collect. This prevents us or anyone else to use the data to identify any single individual.
3. Applications of the data
Measurements that we take from the mobile devices of individual network users enable us to create a detailed picture of the service availability, quality and performance of mobile communication networks across different locations, networks and moments in time. We publish some of the statistical data that we generate and we provide it to our customers (such as network operators , regulators and other ecosystem players) to help them gain better insight in various network and handset performance metrics and market shares.
We do not use the data for direct marketing targeting, movement analytics, behavioral profiling or segmentation.
4. Legal basis for processing data
We collect and process data based on your consent. If you give your consent for accessing your mobile data to take measurements, you can withdraw it through the personal settings on the Partner’s app.
5. How we share data
i. Joint Controllers. We share some of the raw measurements that we collect from users’ mobile devices with some of our customers under the terms of data licence and sharing agreements. While the data we share with our customers may contain location data, this will always be dissociated from individual, persistent user-ID’s, ensuring that no personal data is shared. Our customers are permitted to use the data for the purpose of analysing it and generating aggregated data relating to the performance of networks and equipment and to assess the market shares of devices and operators and to use aggregated data in their sales activities. Our customers cannot use data to communicate with you or to influence you or to profile or track individual users. Neither do we. Our customers are required to keep the data confidential and to use appropriate means to protect it. Our customers have access to data such as location data of users to enable them to analyse the data and create statistical information based on the aggregation of data from numerous users.
ii. Our Partner. We obtain access to data from your mobile device through software incorporated in our Partner’s mobile application which you download onto your device. We might share with our Partner any of the data we collect from your device. Our Partner is permitted to use the data for the purpose of analysing it and generating aggregated data relating to the performance of networks and equipment and to assess the market shares of devices and operators and to use aggregated data in their sales activities. The Partner can not use this data to communicate with you or to influence you or to profile or track individual users.
iii. Service Providers. We may share datasets containing your data with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf in connection with our Services, such as cloud service providers or third party analytical service providers. Where your information is shared with such third parties, we ensure that the third party service provider will deal with your information only on our behalf and on our written instructions and solely for Our benefit (and not for its own benefit).
iv. Business Change. If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganisation, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction, or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer databases containing data of users to successor party or parties in connection with such transaction or change in ownership or legal structure.
v. Necessary Disclosure. Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of our Services; (ii) comply with laws, subpoenas, warrants, court orders, legal processes or requests of government or law enforcement officials; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety or property, or that of our users or others; (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding known or suspected illegal activities; fraud; our rights, reputation, safety or property, or those of our users or others; violation of the Terms of Use, our policies or agreements; or as otherwise required by law.
6. How we protect data
We take certain measures to protect personal data collected through the Service against loss, theft, and unauthorised access, use, disclosure, destruction or modification. These include physical, technological and administrative measures.
7. How long we keep data
Data contained in the sets of measurements of mobile network signal performance is held for an unlimited period of time as it is required for the production of statistical data over different periods of time and to compare performance data between different time periods.
8. Where we process the data
We operate from the United Kingdom (UK) and our data processing activities take place predominantly in the UK. We store and otherwise process data through third party cloud service providers and other IT service providers which may be located or which may operate in other countries, including countries which do not guarantee the same level of protection to privacy as the UK. Some of our customers to which we license data (see section 5(a) above) also receive data from us for processing in countries outside the UK or the EU. When transferring data records from the UK to a country outside the EU which does not provide an adequate level of protection to privacy rights, we put in place appropriate safeguards including data transfer agreements on the terms approved by the EU Commission.
9. EU Data Privacy Rights
Users based in the European Union have the following legal rights in respect of their personal data:
a. The right to require Teragence to confirm whether or not any personal data is being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any information that has been disclosed, the period for which their information is to be stored and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in relation to their information;
b. The right to require Teragence to rectify inaccurate personal data without undue delay;
c. Where Teragence has relied on the ‘consent’ basis for processing any personal data, the right to withdraw their consent at any time. This right to withdraw consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
d. The right to request the erasure of their personal data. You can make a request for erasure where:
i. the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected;
ii. where the processing of the personal data is based on the user’s consent (and the other circumstances described in the ‘Legal Basis for Processing Your information’ and ‘How We May Share Your information’ sections above no longer apply), if the user withdraws his or her consent; or
iii. where the personal data is processed by Teraence solely on the basis of our ‘legitimate interest’ referred to in paragraph 8(a) (and the other legal basis set out in paragraph 8 do not apply), if the user objects to the processing of his or her personal data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing (such as, for example, where the processing of the data is required to meet statutory obligations or for the defence of legal claims). Where Teragence has disclosed the personal data of a European Union user to a third party and the user requests the erasure or rectification of the data, Teragence will take all reasonable steps to inform the third party of such request;
e. The right to require Teragence to restrict its processing of a user’s personal data in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that data is disputed or an objection has been raised.

f. Where data is processed based on user’s consent or to fulfil a contractual obligation, the user has the right to receive his or her personal data from Teragence in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
g. The right to object to the processing of personal data where: i. Teragence relies solely on the ‘legitimate interest’ basis for processing that data, in which case we will be legally required to stop processing the user’s personal data unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the user’s privacy rights and interests; or ii. the information is used for direct marketing purposes, in which case we will immediately stop processing the user’s personal information for such purposes;
h. Users have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority of the EU member state where the user resides. The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or would seriously impair their attainment.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:
Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like
Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.
Legal bases of processing
We process your information for the
purposes
described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
We process your data in order to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract.
We process your data for our legitimate interests and those of
third parties
while applying
appropriate safeguards
that protect your privacy.
We process your data when necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person.
We process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so.
We ask for your consent to process your data for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
How you use Google services and your privacy settings will determine what data is processed, the purposes for which this data is processed, and the legal bases for processing data. The table below explains these processing purposes, the kinds of data processed, and the legal grounds for processing this data, in more detail.
Why and how we process data
What data is processed
Legal grounds
To provide Google services, products, and features
Examples of processing activities:
We process the terms you search for in order to return results.
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video.
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account.
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, we use your shipping address or delivery instructions for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
We process your payment information when you buy extra storage for Google Drive.
We can use contact info (like names and email addresses) of people you interact with in Google products to make it easier to find who you’re looking for when you want to share and communicate with these people in other Google services like Gmail, Photos and Assistant.
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail.
Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
We can help you share your location using
Google Location Sharing
, so that others can find you on a map, or know your estimated time of arrival.
As described in the
Sharing your information

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.

If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more

and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.

Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.

Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.

the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
