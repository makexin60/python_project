Important: Please Read
Life.Church launched in 1996 launch in a two-car garage. Since then, we’ve become recognized for our use of technology to spread the Gospel. We began using video teaching in our services in 2001, were one of the first churches to offer online church in 2006, launched the Bible App in 2008, and more.
Our place at the forefront of digital ministry is driven by our passion to see technology leveraged to help people find hope, peace, and joy in Christ. The Life.Church app and our websites are tools we offer to serve our attenders by connecting them to one another and equipping them to become fully devoted followers of Christ.
Life.Church is also passionate about serving pastors and church leaders around the world to help build the “capital C” Church. Through Life.Church Open Network, leaders can download free resources, and trainings to reach more people.
Every digital product and service we provide is created to help more people pursue a deeper relationship with God safely and securely. We develop these tools as an act of ministry to serve you, and you have choices in your experience. You choose what you access, what you share, and with whom. Your data is yours. Life.Church does not sell your information, nor will we share it with others without your consent.
Every aspect of Life.Church’s digital tools are free, with no strings attached and no advertising. Our intent is to remove every possible barrier so you can know God more.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it discusses how we will collect, use, share, and process your personal information. By using Life.Church sites and services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and its terms.

To make this document easier to read, we’re going to use some shorthand. For example, when we say “our sites” or “Life.Church sites”—whether we reference them individually or collectively—we’re talking about the websites and applications offered by Life.Church, including, but not limited to:

You have choices about how your personal information is accessed, collected, shared, and stored by Life.Church. We take the privacy of the information you provide and that we collect seriously, and we implement security safeguards designed to protect your data.
In general, the information we collect depends on the services you request. In addition to personal information that you provide (such as your name, email address, financial information, and other personally identifiable information), we collect Internet and other network activity information with cookies and other automated technologies as discussed below. We use the data we collect and that you provide as well as inferences we make from that information to:
Provide, support, and personalize our sites and services
Create, maintain, customize, and secure a Life.Church profile or account
Process your requests and respond to your inquiries
Provide information on our products or services

Carry out our obligations and enforce our rights as described in this Privacy Policy in a manner we may describe when you provide the information for another purpose, with your consent.
Below is an overview of the personal information collected on Life.Church sites and the purpose for our collection. Please note: The processing of your information depends on the information you choose to provide and the functionality of our services you choose to use. A more detailed description of our processing of your information is available below.
Your Profile and Information You Provide to Us
We collect personal data when you provide it to us both offline and online. You do not need to provide personal information to use Life.Church sites. You can create a profile, which allows us to tailor our sites and services to be a more personalized experience. To create a profile, we require your first and last name, an email address, and a password to authenticate you when access your profile. Beyond the personal information needed to create a profile, you have choices about what additional information you provide to us, which may include your zip code, the names of family members, gender, social security number, and your marital status, all of which will be stored in association with your profile. Certain information may be required based on your specific request, such as your social security number for employment inquiries and volunteer requests; we will notify you of this at the time of such a request.
We also collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage in communications with us, including when you submit personal information or requests by emailing
help@life.church
. We retain those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our sites and our services.
When you interact with us, the information you provide us is generally stored internally in our third-party relationship management system, or “CRM system.” We will use this information to authenticate you and allow you to access your specific profile, when available. We create user profiles for offline purposes as well, which include volunteerism and inquiries concerning employment. We may combine the information you provide us for your profile and interactions with our sites with information you provide us through other Life.Church sites, services, and products and inferences we make from the same for our internal development to improve the overall quality of our sites, services, and products. We may also make recommendations to you for other Life.Church services based on the information you provide and we infer.
Your Posts
Our Life.Church sites have a wide array of functionality, including streaming video, creating prayer requests, and identifying and communicating with your Life.Church groups and teams. Some Life.Church sites may also allow you to publish, distribute, and display content to specific individuals or the public. We will refer to how you provide content and information as “posted” and the content and information posted as “user contributions.” User contributions may be made on public areas of websites and social media accounts you access through our sites or may otherwise be transmitted to third parties. Your user contributions are processed by us to facilitate your ability to create, use, store, and distribute user contributions as you choose. We will associate your user contributions with your account if you opt not to delete them.
If you disclose personal information, whether through collaborative postings, social media, message boards, or otherwise, this information may be collected and used by others. User contributions are posted and transmitted at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users or third parties with whom you choose to share your user contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that unauthorized persons will not view your user contributions, nor do we accept any liability associated with your user contributions.
Giving
If you choose to provide a donation through one of the Life.Church sites, then and only then will you be prompted and required to provide credit card, bank account, and other financial information necessary to process the transaction. We will collect the designation for your donation if you provide one, and personal information such as your name, address, phone number, and/or email address to ensure that your donation is used for the purpose you request and to provide you with an annual giving statement that itemizes your donation(s). We will also contact you periodically to inquire if you would like to give to another program, location, or cause. We may contact you through push notification, email, mail, or in-app messages to share these opportunities.
This information, excluding your financial information, is stored in our CRM system. As of the date of this Policy, we use Stripe and PayPal to process your online donation payments. For information on how third parties process your information, please refer to their privacy policies found here:
https://stripe.com/privacy
;
https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full
For donations you provide to us in person or by mail, we store your financial information in our databases in an encrypted form for as long as necessary to process your donation and as required by applicable law and GAAP accounting principles.
Life.Church Merchandise
For Life.Church sites where you are able to purchase Life.Church-branded clothing and other items, including
shop.life.church
, your personal and financial information is provided and shared with our third-party contractors that we use to process your order. The third parties are identified at the time of your purchase. For information on how those companies use, store, maintain, and disclose your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies or contact them directly.
Volunteers and Employment Inquiries
You may apply to be a volunteer for miscellaneous activities and events in person at a Life.Church location, over the phone, and through one or more of our sites. You may also apply for employment in person and through our sites.
The information we require for volunteer and employment applications are your first and last name, telephone number, address, social security number, date of birth, and, in the case of a job inquiry, your employment history. We will store and use this information to process your application and associate it with your profile if one exists. We will use your social security number and date of birth solely for a background check in connection with your application to be a volunteer and/or employee. We will not share either with any third party except for third-party service providers that enable us to perform background checks and are obligated not to share your information or use it for any other purpose. If you become an employee of Life.Church, your personal information is also used in connection with your employment.
As a ministry volunteer, you may have access to third-party software which allows you to schedule and check in to your volunteer activity, as well as manage other volunteer activity. This location-based information is stored in association with your profile to enable you to see your past volunteerism, and we also use it for our own internal analysis.

You can delete your Life.Church account credentials at any time using the settings function in the Life.Church application. To request deletion of all account data, you must follow the deletion request instructions above; however, when you delete your account, we will delete the information associated with your account, such as user contributions you have created, received, or shared. If you do not want to delete your account or this information but want to temporarily stop using a Life.Church site, you may cease use, and we will maintain your account and the information associated with your account until you resume use or delete your account, whichever comes first.

Otherwise, if you request that we delete your account, we will delete your account and all the information we have that is associated with your account, except for aggregated statistics based on de-identified information and inferences we have made (for example, the fact that you downloaded our application, without identifying you or maintaining personal information associated with that account).
Our deletion of your information and account will generally take up to 45 days from your request; however, cached information may take up to 30 days to delete. Please note that we have no control of the information you have shared with others through our sites and applications after you close your account, ask to delete information, or attempt to delete your account yourself. Your information and content you have shared may continue to be displayed in the services of others, including search engine results, until their cache refreshes.

For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users.

This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.

As part of the fraud prevention, detection, security monitoring, and compliance efforts for Stripe and its Business Users, we collect information from publicly available sources, third parties (such as credit bureaus), and via the Services we offer. In some instances, we may also collect information about you directly from you, or from our Business Users, Financial Partners, and other third parties for the same purposes. Furthermore, to protect our Services, we may receive details such as IP addresses and other identifying data about potential security threats from third parties.

Additionally, we might use technology to evaluate the potential risk of fraud associated with individuals seeking to procure our Business Services or arising from attempted transactions by an End Customer or End User with our Business Users or Financial Partners.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
. We use Personal Data to meet our contractual and legal obligations related to anti-money laundering, Know-Your-Customer ("KYC") laws, anti-terrorism activities, safeguarding vulnerable customers, export control, and prohibition of doing business with restricted persons or in certain business fields, among other legal obligations. For example, we may monitor transaction patterns and other online signals and use those insights to identify fraud, money laundering, and other harmful activity that could affect Stripe, our Financial Partners, End Users, Business Users and others.

c. Sharing of Personal Data.
Besides the sharing of Personal Data described above, we share Personal Data in the ways listed below:
Stripe Affiliates

We authorize these service providers to use or disclose the Personal Data we make available to them to perform services on our behalf and to comply with relevant legal obligations.

The majority of our service providers are based in the European Union, the United States of America, and India.

In these instances, we will disclose the identity of the third party and the information to be shared with them, and seek your consent to share the information.
Corporate Transactions
. If we enter or intend to enter a transaction that modifies the structure of our business, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, change of control, or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets, or stock, we may share Personal Data with third parties in connection with such transaction. Any other entity that buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your Personal Data, subject to the terms of this Policy.
Compliance and Harm Prevention
. We share Personal Data when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable law; to abide by rules imposed by Financial Partners in connection with the use of their payment method; to enforce our contractual rights; to secure and protect the Services, rights, privacy, safety, and property of Stripe, you, and others, including against malicious or fraudulent activity; and to respond to valid legal requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include authorities outside your country of residence.

The “data controller” or “business” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that has the control over the purposes and means by which the data processing is performed.  The “data processor” or “service provider” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that processes the Personal Information for the data controller, for the data controller’s specific purposes, and as otherwise permitted under applicable data protection laws.
Non-Account Holders and Fastlane Profile Users
Our Services may be accessed by individuals without a PayPal or Xoom account. We will collect Personal Information from you even if you are a non-account holder when you use our Services, such as when you use our Pay Without a PayPal account, use Unbranded Payment Services (e.g., Braintree and Zettle), use a Fastlane profile, or when a non-accountholder receives a payment through the Visa+ service from a PayPal account holder (“Recipient”). If you Pay Without a PayPal account, we may link your transaction information with your PayPal account, if you have one at the time you use the Service without logging in, or if you create a PayPal account later.
With a Fastlane profile, individuals can store their payment methods and other Personal Information with PayPal so that they can complete the checkout process faster,  create a store or loyalty account, or facilitate other transactions at participating Partners and Merchants with payment card, contact information, shipping data or other data they save in their Fastlane profile as relevant to the specific interaction, participating Partner or Merchant, all without having to manually input payment method details and other Personal Information each time they checkout ("Fastlane").
When you create a Fastlane profile, you are agreeing to let PayPal store your Personal Information, including your name, email, phone number, address information, billing information and payment method details, and other data that may be relevant to specific Partner or Merchant interactions, and pre-populate that information in the checkout flows or other interactive features of participating Partners and Merchants so that you can  enjoy a faster Partner and Merchant experience by not having to manually input  your payment or other information. We will also collect transaction and other Partner or Merchant data related to your purchases and other Partner or Merchant interactions when you use Fastlane. If you have a Fastlane profile, we may recognize you as a Fastlane user when you shop on the participating Partners’ and Merchants’ sites, and we may prompt you to engage in participating Partner or Merchant interactions, such as registering for a store or loyalty account using your Fastlane profile information. If you choose to interact with participating Partners or Merchants through Fastlane, you agree to let PayPal disclose your Fastlane profile information to the Participating Partners and Merchants and their service providers, and to facilitate your transaction and shopping experience on the participating Partners and Merchants sites.
The Visa+ Service enables eligible customers with a PayPal account to send and receive money to and from Venmo and third-party Visa+-enabled digital wallets (“Visa+”).
When you shop on Partner and Merchant sites, the Partner or Merchant may disclose Personal Information with PayPal that we will use in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the relevant PayPal user agreement.

If you are a California resident, learn more about how we handle your
Privacy Rights

Understanding your choices
You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.
Choose how we collect Personal Information
You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function.
For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.
Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information
If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.
You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.
Choose what we disclose with other Users
Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.

If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.

To the extent the Personal Information is not subject to these federal and state financial privacy laws and to the extent it is collected in California about California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may apply. The following section pertains only to Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA (“CCPA personal information”) and makes statements that reference unique definitions and requirements of law.
This CCPA California Notice at Collection describes: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “CCPA personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose CCPA personal information for a business purpose, and/or (b) “share” CCPA personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or (c) “sell” such CCPA personal information, as applicable.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the sharing or disclosure of CCPA personal information by a business to a third party, for the targeting of advertising to a consumer, based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s CCPA activity across businesses, websites, applications, or services, other than those with which a consumer uses or directs a business to internally disclose CCPA personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties. “Selling” is defined as the disclosure of CCPA personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, but does not apply to such disclosures when a consumer uses or directs a business to intentionally disclose CCPA personal information or interact with one or more third parties.
We do not sell or share your CCPA personal information, including any Sensitive CCPA personal information, outside the exceptions.
We also do not sell or share, and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any CCPA personal information of anyone under 16 years of age.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose CCPA personal information, please see the “Categories of Personal Information We Collect”, “How is Personal Information used,” and “Do We Disclose Personal Information” sections.
