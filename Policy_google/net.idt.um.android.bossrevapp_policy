6.    Cookies and Other Tracking Technology
Our Services may use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies (collectively “Cookies”) to automatically collect users’ information (including personal information).  Cookies are small data files that are transferred to users’ web browsers and/or stored on their devices as they are browsing.  We may use Cookies to improve our Services and make your user experience online more customized and efficient.  Among other uses, Cookies help us recognize repeat users, facilitate users’ access to and use of BR Websites, and track users’ behavior on websites they visit.  We may compile aggregate data for statistical purposes to improve the content of our sites or to better administer the web pages available on the sites.
Web beacons are used to tell us how and when pages in our sites are visited, by how many people, their point of origin and operating system and to monitor performance with our Services. Web beacons do not collect personal information.
The information collected with these technologies may include (a) your internet protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, location, browser type, and internet service provider information; (b) information about when and how you access and use BR Websites or Services, such as the domains you visit, what features you used and for how long, the website that referred you to us, and date/time stamps associated with your usage; (c) information about the device you use to access the BR Websites or the Services, such as device type, device ID, and device/browser settings; and (d) location of the device used to access the BR Websites or Services derived from GPS or WiFi use.

Cookies can be “Persistent” or “Session” Cookies. Persistent Cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while Session Cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.  We differentiate between Cookies that are essential for the technical features of our sites and optional analytics and advertising Cookies, as follows:
Cookie Type
Description
Essential Cookies
These are cookies that the BR Websites need to function, and that enable you to move around and use the BR Websites and features.  You do not need to enable cookies to visit the BR Websites; however, some aspects of the BR Websites may be difficult or impossible to use if cookies are disabled.  Examples of where these cookies are used include: to determine when you are signed in, to determine when your account has been inactive, and for other troubleshooting and security purposes.
Analytics Cookies
These cookies allow us to understand more about how many visitors we have to the BR Websites, how many times they visit us and how many times a user viewed specific pages within the BR Websites.  Although analytics cookies allow us to gather specific information about the sites that you visit and whether you have visited the BR Websites multiple times, we cannot use them to find out details such as your name or address.
We use certain Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Remarketing and Demographics and Interest Reporting.  Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google that allows us to collect data about the traffic on the BR Websites through Google cookies and other identifiers, which enables us, among other things, to create user segments based on demographic or interest data and to deliver relevant advertising.  Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of our websites and to prepare reports on the activities and share them with other Google services.  Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.  You may be able to opt out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features through your browser ads settings or by visiting Google’s Ads Settings page.  For more information regarding how Google collects, uses and shares your information, please refer to “How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps that Use Our Services,” which can be found at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time.

Cookies.
Web browser applications (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Apple Safari) typically have features that prevent cookies from being sent or notify you when they are sent.  You will need to update your browser’s cookie settings in accordance with your preferences.  Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.  If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to update each browser’s settings separately.  Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked.  IDT does not respond to DNT signals or other similar mechanisms.  If you are using a mobile device, you can reset your device settings to limit the use of information collected about you, including your location data.  This is typically done by disabling your location settings/permissions.  Please contact Apple Support or Google for Android (as applicable) for more information on how to do this on your device.  You can stop all collection of information via our mobile application by uninstalling the application from your device.
I.
Analytics.
Google provides users choices on how their data is collected by Google Analytics by developing an Opt-out Browser Add-on which can be located at: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. By installing this Add-on, no information is being sent to Google Analytics.

Many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations.  For example, you may be located in a jurisdiction that does not give you the right to make these requests.  In such a case, your request may not be fulfilled.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, unduly burdensome, risk the privacy of others, or would be very impractical to honor.  If we are not able to provide the requested information or make the change you requested, you will be provided with the reasons for such decisions.
To exercise these rights, your request must:  (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.  We may need additional information to confirm your identity or your authorized agent’s identity (such as your name, email address and date of birth) or to obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf.  If our verification process is successful, we will respond to your request within the time and in the manner required by applicable law.  If we cannot validate the identity of you and/or your authorized agent or obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf, we will attempt to contact you to inform you.
If you designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf.  You must provide us with a copy of the signed permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us.  If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual, you must attach a copy of a completed Authorized Agent Designation Form (or equivalent form) indicating that you have authorization to act on the individual’s behalf.
