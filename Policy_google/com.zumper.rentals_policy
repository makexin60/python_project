2. How We Collect, Use, and Share Information
To provide you with Zumper’s Services, we must collect and process your information, including your Personal Information.

Some of this information is collected directly by us through the Services, while other information is obtained by us indirectly from third parties.
Collection of Personal Information Overview

identifiers; employment, criminal, financial, and rental histories; criminal histories (except where such collection is prohibited by law); financial information (including your credit score through our consumer-reporting providers); and your rental preferences. You may also provide us with any information you choose to submit to Landlords via our messaging service. We primarily use this information to: connect you to Landlords that you may be interested in renting from; to verify your background information for Landlords; to process your rental applications; and to improve and customize Website functionality.
We share some of the information that you provide with Landlords, Service Providers (as defined below), and other third parties when you express interest in their properties or services. We may also share certain Personal Information to marketing partners and advertisers, as specified below, with your consent or where we are legally authorized to do so.

We share some information that you provide with Tenants, Service Providers, and third party syndicators. We may also sell certain Personal Information to marketing partners and advertisers, as specified below.
As a Landlord, consistent with your agreement to our
Terms and Conditions
and/or
Terms of Service
, information we may provide to you regarding a Tenant may only be used for the purpose of renting to the Tenant.

We may also obtain Personal Information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations, with your consent or where permitted by law.
For example, if you access our Services through a third-party application, such as an app store, a third-party login service, or a social networking site, we may collect Personal Information about you from that third-party application that you have made available via your privacy settings.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about

3. What Are My Rights Regarding My Personal Information?
The CCPA gives California residents certain rights with respect to their Personal Information.
Zumper believes that all users should have the rights provided by the CCPA, and is extending CCPA rights to all of its users.
Summary of User Rights
Users have the right to:
Request information about our collection, use, and disclosure of their information (a “Request to Know”), including:
the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about the user;
the categories of sources from which we have collected the user’s Personal Information;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the user’s Personal Information;
the categories of Personal Information we have sold about the user; and
the categories of Third Parties with whom we have shared, disclosed for a business purpose, or sold the user’s Personal Information, and which categories of Personal Information we have sold to which categories of Third Parties.
Opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information (a “Request to Opt-Out”).
Opt-in of the sale of their Personal Information (a “Request to Opt-In”).
Request that we delete their Personal Information (a “Request to Delete”).
We will not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
In accordance with the CCPA, Landlords who provide Zumper with their Personal Information in their capacity as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, nonprofit, or government agency
do not have the right to submit a Request to Know or Request to Delete.
“Request to Know” Rights
Users may submit a Request to Know by completing the form provided at
http://www.zumper.com/ccpa/request
or by emailing Zumper at
ccpa@zumper.com.
Users may submit two types of Requests to Know: (1) A request for the specific pieces of Personal Information that Zumper has collected about you in the past twelve months; or (2) a request for the categories of Personal Information that Zumper has collected about you in the past twelve months, and how Zumper has used and disclosed your information.
When you submit a Request to Know, we may ask you to provide certain pieces of information in order to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. If you submit a Request to Know for the specific pieces of information that Zumper has collected about you, we may also require you to submit a signed declaration under the penalty of perjury stating that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the Request to Know.
If Zumper is able to verify your identity, we will respond to your Request to Know by: (a) providing the requested information; or (b) explaining why the CCPA does not require us to provide the requested information. If Zumper is unable to verify your identity, Zumper will respond by explaining why it cannot verify your identity. We will confirm receipt of your Request to Know within 10 days and will respond to your Request to Know within 45 days. If a response requires additional time, we will notify you of the basis for the delay and may extend our response period up to an additional 45 days.
If the CCPA requires us to provide the information requested, we will provide the information free of charge and in a readily useable portable format. We have no obligation to provide Personal Information to you more than twice in a 12-month period. If a Request to Know or series of Requests to Know are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the Request(s) to Know, or may refuse to process the Request(s) to Know.
“Request to Opt-Out” Rights
Users may opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information by completing the form provided at
http://www.zumper.com/ccpa/request
or by emailing Zumper at
ccpa@zumper.com.
You may be required to provide certain information to verify your identity and so that we can process your request. We will only use that information for purposes of processing the Request to Opt-Out.
Within 15 days of receiving a Request to Opt-Out, we will:
Not sell your Personal Information unless and until you subsequently provide express authorization for the sale of your Personal Information.
Notify all Third Parties to whom we have sold your Personal Information within 90 days prior to our receipt of your Request to Opt-Out that you have exercised your Right to Opt-Out, and instruct them not to further sell your Personal Information.
Not ask for permission to sell your Personal Information for 12 months after receiving the Request to Opt-Out.
“Request to Opt-In” Rights
Users who have opted out of the sale of their Personal Information may opt back into the sale of their Personal Information by completing the form provided at
http://www.zumper.com/ccpa/request.
“Request to Delete” Rights
Users may submit a Request to Delete by completing the form provided at
http://www.zumper.com/ccpa/request
or by emailing Zumper at
ccpa@zumper.com.
When you submit a Request to Delete, we may ask you to provide certain pieces of information in order to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. If Zumper is able to verify your identity, we will respond to your Request to Delete by (a) deleting your Personal Information and, if applicable, directing any of our Service Providers to delete your Personal Information; or (b) explaining why the CCPA does not require us to delete your Personal Information. Zumper may choose to delete Personal Information by de-identifying, aggregating, or completely erasing the Personal Information. We will specify the manner in which we delete your Personal Information.

3. What Are My Rights Regarding My Personal Information?
The CCPA gives California residents certain rights with respect to their Personal Information. PadMapper believes that all users should have the rights provided by the CCPA, and is extending CCPA rights to all of its users.
Summary of User Rights
Users have the right to:
Request information about our collection, use, and disclosure of their information (a “Request to Know”), including:
the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about the user;
the categories of sources from which we have collected the user’s Personal Information;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the user’s Personal Information;
the categories of Personal Information we have sold about the user; and
the categories of Third Parties with whom we have shared, disclosed for a business purpose, or sold the user’s Personal Information, and which categories of Personal Information we have sold to which categories of Third Parties.
Opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information (a “Request to Opt-Out”).
Opt-in of the sale of their Personal Information (a “Request to Opt-In”).
Request that we delete their Personal Information (a “Request to Delete”).
We will not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
In accordance with the CCPA, Landlords who provide PadMapper with their Personal Information in their capacity as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, nonprofit, or government agency do not have the right to submit a Request to Know or Request to Delete.
“Request to Know” Rights
Users may submit a Request to Know by completing the form provided at
https://www.padmapper.com/ccpa/request
or by emailing PadMapper at
ccpa@padmapper.com.
Users may submit two types of Requests to Know: (1) A request for the specific pieces of Personal Information that PadMapper has collected about you in the past twelve months; or (2) a request for the categories of Personal Information that PadMapper has collected about you in the past twelve months, and how PadMapper has used and disclosed your information.
When you submit a Request to Know, we may ask you to provide certain pieces of information in order to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. If you submit a Request to Know for the specific pieces of information that PadMapper has collected about you, we may also require you to submit a signed declaration under the penalty of perjury stating that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the Request to Know.
If PadMapper is able to verify your identity, we will respond to your Request to Know by: (a) providing the requested information; or (b) explaining why the CCPA does not require us to provide the requested information. If PadMapper is unable to verify your identity, PadMapper will respond by explaining why it cannot verify your identity. We will confirm receipt of your Request to Know within 10 days and will respond to your Request to Know within 45 days. If a response requires additional time, we will notify you of the basis for the delay and may extend our response period up to an additional 45 days.
If the CCPA requires us to provide the information requested, we will provide the information free of charge and in a readily useable portable format. We have no obligation to provide Personal Information to you more than twice in a 12-month period. If a Request to Know or series of Requests to Know are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the Request(s) to Know, or may refuse to process the Request(s) to Know.
“Request to Opt-Out” Rights
Users may opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information by completing the form provided at
https://www.padmapper.com/ccpa/request
or by emailing PadMapper at
ccpa@padmapper.com.
You may be required to provide certain information to verify your identity and so that we can process your request. We will only use that information for purposes of processing the Request to Opt-Out.
Within 15 days of receiving a Request to Opt-Out, we will:
Not sell your Personal Information unless and until you subsequently provide express authorization for the sale of your Personal Information.
Notify all Third Parties to whom we have sold your Personal Information within 90 days prior to our receipt of your Request to Opt-Out that you have exercised your Right to Opt-Out, and instruct them not to further sell your Personal Information.
Not ask for permission to sell your Personal Information for 12 months after receiving the Request to Opt-Out.

PadMapper may choose to delete Personal Information by de-identifying, aggregating, or completely erasing the Personal Information. We will specify the manner in which we delete your Personal Information.
If a Request to Delete or series of Requests to Delete are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the Request(s) to Delete, or may refuse to process the Request(s) to Delete.
Authorized Agents
Users may submit Requests to Know, Requests to Opt-Out, and Requests to Delete through an Authorized Agent.
