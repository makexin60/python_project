We may use information (including your personal information) in countries other than where your device is located in connection with providing you with our Mobizen Screen Recorder service and any other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The data protection laws in many of these countries may not offer the same level of protection as those in the country where you are located.

After the expiration of such period, the relevant information will be deleted or anonymized. Where we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no other legal basis to continue with that processing, if you subsequently withdraw your consent, then we will delete your personal information.
