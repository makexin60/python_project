6) Privacy for Kids
We don’t knowingly collect information from kids under 13. If you believe your child has shared data with us, please contact us and we’ll take care of it.
7) Permissions We Use and Their Purpose
Our app requests the following permissions to function effectively:
> SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW:
This permission allows the app to display notifications, alerts, or animations over other apps. It is used for
displaying charging animations or battery alerts that need immediate attention from the user.
> INTERNET:
The app requires internet access to fetch online data, download additional themes or animations, and display ads. This
permission also supports server communication for app updates and online functionalities.
> RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED:
This permission allows the app to automatically start background services after the device has booted. It
ensures that battery
monitoring and alarm functionalities continue to work without the need for manual relaunching after a restart.
> POST_NOTIFICATIONS:
This permission is necessary for sending notifications to users, such as battery status updates, alarms for low or
full battery, and
other important alerts.
> REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS
: This permission allows the app to request an exception from battery optimization settings.
It is
critical for ensuring that background services (such as battery monitoring and alarms) run continuously without being restricted by
power-
saving measures.
> READ_MEDIA_IMAGES
(Android 13+) /
READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
(Android 12 and
below):
Allows users
to customize charging animations or alerts using their photos or media files, enhancing personalization.
> PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS:
This permission is used to access app usage statistics, allowing the app to monitor battery usage by other
applications
and provide performance monitoring features.
> MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS:
This permission enables the app to modify the global audio settings on the device, such as controlling volume
levels for battery alarms or switching between different audio profiles (e.g., ringer, silent, or vibration mode).
> VIBRATE:
The app uses this permission to control the device's vibration motor, providing haptic feedback or vibration alerts for battery
alarms.
> BLUETOOTH:
This permission allows the app to connect to Bluetooth devices, especially if there are any Bluetooth-related features, such
as
checking battery
status of connected devices.
> ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:
This permission allows the app to check the current network status (Wi-Fi or mobile data). It is essential for
determining when the device has internet access for downloading additional content or syncing data.
> FOREGROUND_SERVICE:
This permission allows the app to run as a foreground service, which is necessary for long-running tasks such as
monitoring battery status or running alarms while keeping the user informed with notifications.
> FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE:
This permission allows the app to run essential services in the foreground, ensuring continuous
battery monitoring, charging alerts, and visible notifications, even when the app is closed.
8) Keeping Your Data Safe
We use various security measures to protect your data. While we strive to keep everything safe, no system is completely immune to breaches.
