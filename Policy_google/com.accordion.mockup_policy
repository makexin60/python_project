We
prioritize the privacy of our users and this Privacy Policy (the
“
Policy
”
) outlines
how we collect, use, protect, and share information when you use the App. It
also explains the options available to you for managing your information
preferences. It is important to carefully review the following information to
fully understand our practices regarding the use of your information. By using
the application, you indicate your acceptance and agreement with this Privacy
Policy. If you do not agree with any of the terms outlined in this policy,
please refrain from using our services.
Information We Collect
Usage
Information
The
App may collect information such as your activities, downloads, shares,
encountered issues, photo or video edits, and any other data you provide while
using our services. This data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of
the App.
Images
or videos you select when using the App
To
safeguard the security of your photos and videos, the App exclusively processes
only the ones you have chosen to edit. We do not gather complete photo or video
albums, even with authorized access. Each edited photo or video is encrypted
with a unique key that is stored on your device, ensuring that only your device
can retrieve it. It should be noted that while metadata is not mandatory, it
may be automatically linked to your photos or videos.
Location
In
order to offer personalized content tailored to your preferences, we collect
approximate location information, including data derived from your SIM card
and/or IP address to determine your location.
Device
and log information
We
gather device and log information to improve the user experience and provide
relevant advertisements when you use our Services through the App, ensuring a
smooth and secure experience. This information encompasses unique device
identifiers, MAC address, GUID, device model, system language, country,
advertising identifier, operating system, system version number, IP address,
software version number, access network, network quality data, and service log
information.
How We Collect Information
In
order to enhance your experience with the App and ensure its stability, we
gather location and device log information directly from your usage.
Additionally, we utilize tracking tools such as Google Firebase Analytics,
Google Admob, and Meta to passively collect data on how you use our App.
How We Use Information
We
continuously enhance our Services by using the information, ensuring that the
App remains user-friendly and meets the needs of our users. The information
helps us understand how the App is being used and allows us to make necessary
improvements for a better user experience.
Service
Providers.
At
times, we may establish partnerships with reputable businesses that have
verified their commitment to privacy protection similar to ours ("Service
Providers"). These businesses may be engaged to provide specific services,
such as customer support, analytics, and data storage and management. We only
share the necessary information with Service Providers to enable them to
deliver these services on our behalf. Service Providers are required to adhere
to reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized
access, use, or disclosure, depending on the nature of the information. They
are prohibited from using your information for purposes other than those
specified by us.
Advertising
partners.
We
use third-party cookies and tracking tools to enable our advertising partners
to gather data from your device. This data may be used to deliver advertisements
within the App.
Other
Transfers.
We
may share your information with affiliated businesses, including those under
common ownership or control. In the event of a merger, acquisition, sale of our
company, or transfer of assets, your information may be disclosed or
transferred as part of the transaction. If the new entity intends to handle
your information in a manner different from what is outlined in this Privacy
Policy, you may be given the option to opt-out of the transfer at our
discretion.
Storage and Retention of Your Information
Storage
of Your Information
Your
information may be transferred and stored at locations within or outside your
country for the specific purposes outlined in the Policy. By providing us with
your information, you consent to this transfer, storage, or processing. We are
committed to ensuring that your information is safeguarded and handled in
compliance with the Policy and relevant laws to the best of our ability.
Retention
of Your Information
Typically,
we will retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary to
provide the Services, fulfill the initial purposes for which it was collected,
or for other business needs, including compliance with legal obligations,
resolution of disputes, and enforcement of our agreements. Legal requirements,
such as the statute of limitations, may dictate the retention of specific types
of data for a defined period. If your personal information is no longer
required for legal or business purposes, we will either delete it or anonymize
it.
Security
Safeguarding
the confidentiality of your information is a top priority for us, and we have
implemented measures to prevent unauthorized access to your data. However, it
is challenging to ensure with absolute certainty the security of data
transmission over the internet or other networks. While we make every effort to
protect all information transmitted on or through the application, we cannot
guarantee the security of any information transmitted through the application.
You are responsible for any risks associated with such transmissions.
Children's Privacy
We
are not intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of
13. By using our Services, you affirm that you are at least 13 years old. If we
unintentionally receive Personal Information from a child under 13, we will
promptly remove it from our records. Additionally, we advise that children aged
13 and older should obtain parental permission before sharing any personal
information with anyone online.
