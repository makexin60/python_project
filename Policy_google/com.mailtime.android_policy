If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at
privacy@mailtime.com
.
Information that’s been de-identified
For the purpose of this subsection on “Information that’s been de-identified”, we use Commercial Messages from your Connected Email Account for the de-identification and/or aggregation purposes as explained below, but we do not use any Non-Commercial Messages in doing so. We only access and process Non-Commercial Messages in your Connected Email Accounts as authorized by you to convert such email messages to text messages, to enable you to enjoy the functionalities and services provided by our MailTime App, and to provide the MailTime App Services to you.
We use information from Commercial Messages collected through your Connected Email Accounts, such as date , merchant, price, or other commercial or transactional information, to create de-identified or aggregated data so that you are not identified as an individual (the “De-identified or Aggregated Data”). We use the De-identified or Aggregated Data to develop alternative data products and for our business purposes, and provide such De-identified or Aggregated Data to subscribers of MAI Product (as further explained below).
MAI Products
: We use the De-identified or Aggregated Data to create consumer insights, and to develop analytics and reports for market trends, industry development, marketing optimization, and other business intelligence. For example, we scan and identify purchase receipts from Commercial Messages collected from your Connected Email Accounts, aggregate such de-identified information with other de-identified information from our other users of MailTime App to create De-identified or Aggregated Data, which will become part of the database or data feeds we provide to subscribers of the MAI Products. We share the De-identified or Aggregated Data with users of the MAI Products and our other partners for their research, development, or other commercial purposes.
We may also allow partners to collect aggregated or de-identified information from you, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, Google Analytics services may collect aggregated information about our users’ demographics. Again, Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt-out of Google’s use of Cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at www.google.com/privacy_ads.html or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/
.
In all cases where we provide De-identified or Aggregated Data to third party partners, we adopt the following protections:
We will not disclose De-identified or Aggregated Data in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.
All your Personal Data will be removed or obfuscated prior to any such sharing. If we do combine de-identified information with your Personal Data, the combined information will be treated as Personal Data for as long as it remains combined
We prohibit all subscribers of MAI Products to whom we share the De-identified or Aggregated Data from attempting to re-identify you as an individual person.
We endeavor to only include Commercial Messages when creating the De-identified or Aggregated Data that will be shared with any third party partners.
We are not interested in personal correspondence. The data we use to create Data Reports or Aggregated and Anonymized Data is only that identified as commercial/transactional emails.
OPT OUT
: You may opt out of sharing information from your Commercial Messages for our use to create De-identified or Aggregated Data at any time by (i) going to
https://mailtime.com/optout/optout.html
, or (ii) changing the settings in the MailTime App (under “Legal & Privacy). You can continue to use the MailTime App services with no degradation to your experience.
About Gmail Users:
The way we can use the information we receive from your connected email accounts is also subject to the policies imposed by your email service providers and your account settings with them. As you may know, Google recently implemented an updated Google API Services: User Data Policy (
https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy
, the “Google API Policy”), which restricts the use of data obtained from certain restricted Gmail APIs, as well as data aggregated, anonymized, or derived from them. In order to comply with the Google Policy, we decide not to include any data that we obtained from those restricted Gmail APIs in our big data products (including MAI). In order to comply with the Google Policy, we will only use the data that we obtained from the restricted Gmail APIs for the specific “Limited Uses” as permitted by the Google Policy. Our use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. These restrictions do not apply if you have used the 2-step verification process to create an App password for the Services using your Google account. If you have any questions, or would like to learn more about this, please feel free to reach out at

Future of Privacy Forum
launched this website in 2013 to provide information on how web browsers can express a user’s preference for tracking using Do Not Track (DNT).
DNT is a technical specification designed to help users express their preferences about online tracking. It is a set of rules that help your web browser tell websites if you don’t want your online activities to be tracked, including a simple way for users to set this preference and for websites to communicate back about whether they will respect your choice. The
specific rules
were developed in the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
, an organization dedicated to creating a universal standard that streamlines web protocols and practices. However, the efforts led by the W3C did not result in a W3C Recommendation. As a result of the lack of consensus on how companies should operationalize the DNT preference, most sites do not respond to DNT as a consumer’s choice not to be tracked.
Legislative developments in California and other states have replaced aspects of DNT, leading to the development of the
Global Privacy Control (GPC)
, an opt-out signal to websites, informing them that the user does not want their personal information sold as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Similarly, the California Data Deletion Act (
SB362
) allows California residents to have their personal information deleted by all registered data brokers in the state. Meanwhile, California’s Do Not Track Law (
AB370
) still requires most commercial websites to disclose whether and how they respect Do Not Track signals.
