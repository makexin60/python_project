Privacy Policy
RajArya, the developer of the Walley App, is committed to protecting user privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information when using our Walley App, including information related to in-app purchases and Firebase integration.
By choosing to use our Walley App, you consent to the collection and utilization of information as described in this policy. The Personal Information we collect is solely used for improving and delivering the Walley App, managing in-app purchases, and delivering Firebase integration services. We assure you that we will not share or utilize your information for any purposes other than those explicitly stated in this Privacy Policy.
The terminology used in this Privacy Policy holds the same definitions as outlined in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the Walley App unless explicitly specified otherwise.
**Information Collection and Use**
To enhance your experience with our Walley App and facilitate in-app purchases and Firebase services, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. This information may include but is not limited to your name, email address, payment information, and device-specific details. We collect and store this information securely for the purpose of processing payments, providing premium memberships, and delivering subscription services.
**In-App Purchases**
Our Walley App offers in-app purchases, including the purchase of collections, premium memberships, and one-year subscriptions for premium content. These purchases are processed securely through authorized app stores (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store) and are subject to the respective app store's terms and policies. We do not have access to your payment information, as it is handled directly by the app store's payment processing system.
**Firebase**
We have integrated Firebase services into our Walley App to enhance its functionality and user experience. Firebase may collect and process certain data, including but not limited to user analytics, crash reports, and in-app interactions. This data helps us improve our app's performance and user satisfaction. Firebase may also use cookies and similar technologies for these purposes.
**Log Data**
Whenever you use our Walley App, in the event of an app error or to improve our services, we may collect data and information, including Log Data, through third-party products on your device. This Log Data may include your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the app's configuration during use, timestamps of your interactions with the Walley App, and other statistical data.
**Cookies**
Our Walley App may incorporate third-party code and libraries that employ cookies to gather information and enhance their respective services, including Firebase services. You have the option to accept or decline these cookies, and your device can notify you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose to decline our cookies, certain portions of the Walley App may be inaccessible.
**Service Providers**
In order to deliver and improve our Walley App, we may engage the services of third-party companies and individuals for various reasons, including facilitating the App, providing the App on our behalf, performing App-related tasks, or assisting us in analyzing the usage of our Walley App.
It is important to note that these third parties may have access to your Personal Information for the sole purpose of fulfilling their assigned tasks on our behalf. However, they are strictly obligated not to disclose or utilize your information for any other purposes.
**Security**
At RajArya, we highly value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information. As such, we employ commercially acceptable measures to protect it. However, it is important to acknowledge that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure and reliable. Therefore, while we strive to use the most secure means possible, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.
**Links to Other Sites**
Our Walley App may contain links to external websites. Please be aware that these sites are operated independently and are beyond our control. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policies of these websites, as we assume no responsibility for their content, privacy policies, or practices.
**Childrenâ€™s Privacy Policies**
Our Walley App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the event that we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take the necessary actions.
**Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically, and it is advisable to review this page regularly for any changes. We will notify you of any revisions by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page.
