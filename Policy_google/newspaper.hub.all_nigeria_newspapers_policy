Accordingly, we're providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Any information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time that information is collected. Stello Declares, It Doesn't Receive Information & Why: Stello has no plan to receive Personal Customer Information for the business purposes of providing software as a service (collectively referred to herein as "Services") to its customers. 
We may modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Suppose we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy. In that case, we'll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or take other actions as required by applicable law, and we'll indicate when those changes will become effective. Also, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.
Information Related to Your Use of the Services
Device Data:
The third parties we work with and we may automatically collect specific data about the device you use to access our Services. This data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, mobile advertising identifiers (Google Advertising ID or Apple Advertising ID), other unique identifiers, cookie identifiers, model name, operating system, country code, app version, and other user settings and preferences.
Location Data:
You may, by your own choice, provide us with your location data, such as your postal code, city, and state information, or GPS location for us to display the weather, the local news, and the local advertisements to you. In addition, we may also infer your location based on your IP address and use various other technologies to determine your approximate location, such as sensor data from your device that provides information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
Third-Party Partners:
We may receive your information from our partners, such as publishers, advertisers, and third-party data providers. Our partners may provide demographic data and information about your activities and interests in our services, including your device, device identifiers, your precise or approximate location, websites and advertisements you interact with, your browsing patterns, and information about how you use our partner's services.
General. You may have the right to opt out of specific uses of your information.
Mobile Devices:
We may send you to push notifications through our App. You may opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device. We may also collect precise location information via our App if you enable such collection. You may opt out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device.
Personalized Advertising:
If you would like to opt-out of the advertising and other similar technologies (e.g., cookies) we employ on the Services, you may do so by blocking, disabling, or deleting them as your browser or device permits, including by following the steps set forth below. Please note that you can opt-out of personalized advertising, but you will continue to see non-personalized online advertising on the Services and other digital properties.
To opt-out of the personalized advertising by certain third parties: please opt-out of the personalized advertisement using your account settings on each applicable service or contact us. If you do not have an account on a specific service, you likely will not see any personalized advertisements from that service.
Aggregated Information:
Feedly may use aggregated or de-identified information (not containing personal information) ("Aggregated Information") to analyze trends and improve its Services.
If you want to exercise any of these rights, visit our mobile application's "Settings" menu. Once you are in the Settings menu, click "Help Center." Once you are in the Help Center, the Help Center has a form for receiving inquiries. Please fill out the form with your inquiry or request. Please specify the nature of your request in the email you send. There is also a function in the Help Center to delete your personal information that is used to provide account features and news feeds (see here for details). If you have any questions, please get in touch with us as set forth below. Please note that technical limitations may prevent us from fulfilling specific requests. We may make deletion requests by de-identifying or anonymizing information, so it is no longer personal information.
We will process such requests following applicable laws. To protect your privacy, Stello News will take steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. To verify your request, we use an identifier unique to your device that our App has assigned. If you submit a request following the above instructions, we will automatically receive the identifier. If we do not receive this identifier when you make a request, we will not be able to verify your identity and will deny your request. We have established uniform rules and manuals for handling user data, which clarify the policies and specific handling methods that must be observed according to the lifecycle of app data. These are shared among our group companies involved in developing our App, and regular training and audits by a specialized department are conducted.
Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.
