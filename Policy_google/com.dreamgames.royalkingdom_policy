Personal Data Collected from Third Parties
Most of the personal data that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our games or interact with our Services. However, we may also collect personal data from third parties in the following circumstances:
Social Media
: When you interact with our Services through various social media networks, such as when you "Like" our official page on Facebook or follow us, or share our official page’s content on Google, Facebook, X, or other social networks, we may receive some information about you. The data we receive depends on your privacy settings with the social network and may include name, profile picture and friends list. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites, social media networks, and services before making your personal data publicly available and/or linking or connecting your account on one service to other services.
App Marketplaces:
When you download our mobile applications or make in-app payments through the Apple App Store, Google Play or other app marketplaces, we receive personal data about your device, account and payments. We do not receive access to your credit card or bank account data when you make in-app payments through these app marketplaces. The personal data we receive from these third-party companies will depend on your privacy settings with them.
Information we receive from authentication services you connect to our Service
: Some parts of our Services may allow you to log in through a third-party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook, Google and Apple. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us, which could include your name, email address and user ID associated with the third party, profile picture, and, in the case of Facebook, the names and avatars of your Facebook friends who are already playing our games. The data we receive is dependent on that third party's policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. Where available, you will also be able to see which of your friends are playing the same game and their progress through the games (and they will be able to see you and your progress) or access other functionality we make available in our games and other Services, such as inviting friends to play. You can choose not to allow us to access your email address in the Facebook dialog box you see the first time you associate your Facebook account with your Dream Games profile.
Logging in with Facebook will not allow us to post anything to your page without your permission, and we will not receive any information about your Facebook friends who do not play our games. If you do not wish your Facebook friends to be able to see your progress in our games, you can prevent this by disconnecting your Facebook account from our games and updating your app permissions from within your Facebook settings. If you choose not to connect your Dream Games profile to your Facebook, Google or Apple account, the personal data that we collect when you play our games will be linked to a randomly generated user ID rather than information that could identify you directly, but we will collect device-level identifiers and other information associated with those identifiers described above. We recommend that you read

However, we may still process any personal data we collected from you before you deleted our games from your mobile device. You can also reset your mobile advertising identifier using your phone, in which case you will appear to us and our advertising partners as a new user that is not associated with any prior activity or data.
Deactivate Your Account:
Should you wish to deactivate your account completely, you can disassociate your Facebook account from our mobile games and delete our games from your mobile devices. Please note that if you completely deactivate your account, all your progress in our games and any unspent virtual items will be lost, and we may not be able to restore them in the future. We may still process personal data we collected from you before you deactivated your account.
Change our Services’ Access to Your Device Information:
You may control our Services' access to your device information through your "Settings" app on your device. For instance, you can withdraw permission for our Services to access your network devices and location data and to integrate with your other applications.
Deactivate Push Notifications:

You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by changing the relevant settings on your mobile device.
Targeted Advertising
:
If you reside in the EEA, UK, Switzerland, Türkiye or South Korea, we request your consent to engage in the targeted advertising activities described in Section 5 (Targeted Advertising) when you first launch our games. If you consent, you may subsequently withdraw your consent at any time by going to Settings > Terms & Privacy.
If you reside in the U.S., you can opt out of the targeted advertising activities described in Section 5 (Targeted Advertising) by going to Settings > Terms & Privacy. If you opt out of targeted advertising, you may still see ads for our products and Services, but that advertising will not be targeted using your personal data.
You can also choose to prevent your device's ad identifier from being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier by changing your device's settings. Settings vary from device to device, but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.
To update your advertising preferences with Facebook, you will need to log in to your account on Facebook and update your settings there.

If you are above the age of 12 but under the age of 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if this is higher than 18), you must ask your parent or legal guardian to read this Privacy Policy because you are not allowed to use our Services without the permission of your parent or legal guardian. Parents can enable or disable chat, in-app payments, and certain other features through the parental control setting under “Settings” menu. Once parental controls are activated, these features cannot be changed without a pre-set password.

9. SECURITY
We maintain physical, technical, electronic and procedural measures intended to protect personal data from unauthorized processing, including firewalls, data encryption technologies, internal data security protocols and data protection and processing agreements with organizations that receive your personal data from us. However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data you transmit to us or through our Services.
10. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
Our Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications.

Once the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected it, we will delete it.

When we process your information as necessary for a task carried out in the public interest, you have the right to object to, and seek restriction of, our processing. To exercise your rights, visit the

In assessing an objection, we will consider several factors, including: our users' reasonable user expectations; the benefits and risks to you, us, other users or third parties; and other available means to achieve the same purpose that may be less invasive and do not require disproportionate effort.
Your objection will be upheld, and we will cease processing your information, unless we find that we have compelling legitimate grounds for this processing which are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms or the processing is needed for legal reasons.

Why and how we process your information
Information categories we use (see '
What Information do we collect?
' for more detail on each information category)
        
The actual information we use depends on your factual circumstances, but could include any of the following:
Protecting the vital interests of you and/or those of another person: We apply automated processing techniques, conduct manual (human) review and share information, including with law enforcement and others, in circumstances where someone’s vital interests require protection, such as in the case of emergencies. These vital interests include protection of your life, physical or mental health, wellbeing or integrity or that of others, and detecting, removing, and reporting illegal content. In protecting such vital interests we aim to combat harmful conduct and promote safety, integrity and security, including, for example, when we are investigating reports of harmful conduct or taking appropriate action, such as sharing information with relevant authorities, when someone needs help.
