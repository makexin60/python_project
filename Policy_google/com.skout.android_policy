1.  INTRODUCTION
These Terms of Service (“TOS”) are a legal agreement between you and The Meet Group, Inc. (“TMG,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and govern your access and/or use of the Skout mobile application and website (“Skout”) made available to you by us (the “Services”).  If you have any questions or comments about these TOS, please contact us at
support@themeetgroup.com
.
By accepting these TOS, accessing or using Skout, or otherwise manifesting your assent to these TOS, you agree to be bound by (i) these TOS, (ii) our
Community Guidelines
, and (iii) any additional or special terms for any additional features as may be posted from time to time (collectively, the “Agreement”). If you do not agree (or cannot comply) with all of the terms of these TOS or any other terms of the Agreement, you may not access or use Skout. All information about how we process your personal information can be found in our
Privacy Policy
.
THE SECTION BELOW TITLED “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER” CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER THAT AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
We reserve the right to change these TOS at any time. You are responsible to keep yourself apprised of any such changes. If we make any material change to the TOS, we will notify you of such change when you open Skout. If you object to any Terms of Service of the TOS or any subsequent changes or you become dissatisfied with Skout in any way, your only option is to stop using Skout. Your continued use of Skout after we post revised TOS means that you agree to the revisions.
We use the term “Users” in these TOS to include all end users of Skout, including end users who are streaming or broadcasting through Skout (“Streamers”). Skout operates within a network of other applications owned or operated by TMG and/or Live Partners (“Live Network”). To find out which Live Partners are in the Live Network, please click

2.  ACCOUNT ELIGIBLITY AND USE OF SKOUT
You must be at least 18 years old to register for Skout. If you are under the age of 18, you may not access or use Skout. By accessing the Services and/or completing the registration process for Skout, you represent that you are 18 years of age or older and can and will be legally bound by this Agreement.
Skout is for your personal use only and you may not use it for any other purpose. You may not use Skout in connection with any commercial activity without our express written approval. Companies and other organizations may not become Users of Skout nor use Skout without our express written approval. We reserve the right to investigate any suspected unauthorized uses of Skout and we may take action in our sole discretion, including without limitation seeking legal, civil, criminal, or injunctive relief.
You may not use Skout where prohibited by law, and you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content.
3.  REGISTRATION
To access and use Skout you will need to register. To do this, you will need to choose an available registration option, such as email, SMS, Sign in with Apple, Sign in with Google or Facebook, and provide login credentials, such as email address and a password of your choice. You are responsible for keeping your password and account credentials confidential. Furthermore, you are responsible for any and all culpably caused activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security once you receive knowledge of it.
You can delete your account by going to Settings and selecting the option to delete your account.
We may delete your account if you are inactive for more than two years. To prevent this you have to log in at least once every two years.
4.  SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IN-APP CURRENCY
4.1.  SUBSCRIPTIONS
You may purchase a subscription product in various packages, such as one-month, three-month, or six-month subscriptions. A purchase of a subscription concluded, billed, charged, renewed and can be cancelled or terminated as described in these TOSs. If you purchase through the Apple App Store or Google Play, your purchase is subject to the technical standards and principles established by Apple or Google, over which we have no control. Your subscription will renew automatically for the same amount of time as your original subscription unless you switch off the auto-renew feature at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription. This is because your account may be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of your current subscription period. You can manage your subscription and switch off auto-renewal by accessing your Apple or Google account settings. You can also follow the instructions how to cancel a subscription provided by Apple (https://getsupport.apple.com/) or Google (https://support.google.com/googleplay/).  You may not cancel your current subscription during the subscription period, although you may cancel automatic renewal at any time.
If you subscribed through the Apple App Store, refunds are handled by Apple, not us. You can request a refund from Apple as described above. All other users may request a refund by contacting us at support@themeetgroup.com, or by mailing or delivering a signed and dated notice that states that you are cancelling this agreement, or words of similar effect. Please also include your name and the email address, phone number, or other unique identifier you used to sign up for your account. This notice shall be sent to: The Meet Group, Attn: Cancellations, 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA.
Both Apple and Google facilitate “free trials” of subscription products for first-time users and we may take advantage of that ability. For example, from time to time we may offer a free initial week to first-time subscribers. Eligibility for any such trial is limited to users who have not previously subscribed, through either a current or prior Skout account. If you are a previous subscriber and try to claim a free trial, you should be aware that Apple or Google may recognize your ineligibility. If so, you may not receive a free trial, but instead may be charged immediately for your first subscription month. This is a feature controlled by the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, depending on which platform you use for Skout.
Generally, purchases of subscriptions are non-refundable (unless special terms for refunds apply in your region) and non-transferable, even if they expire or are discontinued. We may change the purchase price for subscriptions at any time, as well as the features included in subscriptions. We reserve the right to stop issuing subscriptions at any time and to set expiration dates for subscriptions. Subscriptions may not be redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value. If you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason, you will lose all unused subscription time without refund or other compensation.
4.2.  RIGHT TO TERMINATE SUBSCRIPTION
You have the right to terminate (or withdraw from) your subscription within fourteen (14) days of acceptance, for any reason. For residents of the European Economic Area, please refer to section 22 for further information on this right.  In addition, where required by law, your estate is entitled to claim a refund of the unused portion of your subscription if you die during the term of the subscription.
In order to exercise either of these rights, you (or, if applicable, your estate) must notify us by registered mail at The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, Attention: Member Services, or by email at support@themeetgroup.com with a clear declaration of your decision to terminate your subscription.
In order to meet the termination deadline, you should send us notification of your exercise of the right of termination prior to the expiration of the fourteen-day termination period.
If you terminate (or withdraw) from your subscription, we will refund the payments we have received from you, minus any amount of Points that you have consumed. If you wish to terminate (or withdraw from) your purchase of Points, we will refund the payments we have received from you, minus any amount of Points that you have consumed. If you are an Android user, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction. If you are an iOS, personal computer, or mobile web user, we will refund you by paper check or PayPal if you provide the proper contact information to process these payments. In no case will you be charged for this refund.
4.3.  POINTS AND VIRTUAL GIFTS
You can purchase or otherwise obtain “Points” from us. Points give you a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to activate in-app features like virtual gifts on Skout. Virtual gifts are live animations which are provided by Skout. You may trigger a virtual gift in the stream of a Streamer within the Live Network.
If you purchase through the Apple App Store or Google Play, your purchase is subject to the technical standards and principles established by Apple or Google, over which we have no control.
If you trigger a virtual gift, this does not create a contractual relationship between you and the Streamer in whose stream the gift is triggered. Whether and to what extent a Streamer receives diamonds is entirely at our discretion. Points are non-refundable even if they expire, are revoked or are discontinued. The price for each virtual gift will be displayed at the point of purchase. All sales of Points are final, and we do not offer credit or refund for any purchased Points. When you receive virtual gifts from other Users, you do not own them. Instead, you receive a specified corresponding number of Diamonds which may be used as set forth below. We are not responsible for repairing or replacing virtual gifts or providing you or any third party with any credit or refund in the event that we modify, suspend, or terminate the virtual gift program, or for loss or damage due to any service error, or any other reason. Points may be used only within the Live Network and have no application or value (cash or otherwise) outside of the Live Network.  Points may not be converted into, or redeemed for, fiat currency or Diamonds within the Live Network.  Points are also not redeemable for real-world goods, services, discounts or purchases and are intended solely for use within the Live Network.
We may at any time change the purchase price for Points or the number of Credit that you may redeem for a particular virtual gift at any time, as well as the ways you can use Points and virtual gifts. We reserve the right to revoke or stop the sale of Points and redemption of virtual gifts at any time without notice, refund, or compensation, and to set expiration dates for Points and virtual gifts. Points and virtual gifts may not be redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value. If you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason, or your account is banned due to violations of our Content and Conduct Policy or any other reason, you will lose all accumulated Points without notice, refund or other compensation. You agree that we will have no liability to you, any other user, Content Provider or other third-party based on our exercise of our rights with respect to Points and virtual gifts.
Points and virtual gifts purchased or received by any user do not constitute property or money and are not transferable. All Points in your account are forfeited if you delete your account or your account is blocked or deleted for any reason.
4.4.  DIAMONDS
Streamers may receive a certain amount of virtual diamonds (“Diamonds”) for virtual gifts that are triggered by other Users during their Livestream (“Diamond Reward”), as determined by us. In addition, Streamers may receive Diamonds through other means, in our sole discretion. Streamers may be able to redeem Diamonds for fiat currency or convert the Diamonds into Points at rates and at times specified by us in our sole discretion. In order to cash out Diamonds, a Streamer  must (1) fill out any forms that may be requested, including tax or other government forms (e.g., an IRS form W-9 for U.S. taxpayers and an IRS form W-8 for non-U.S. taxpayers), (2) cash out at least the minimum amount as required by us from time to time worth of Diamonds for each request, (3) meet the eligibility requirements of any third-party vendor, and (4) successfully complete our identity verification and eligibility requirements. We reserve the right to clawback or recover Diamonds or decline or cancel any cash out for any reason, including if any documentation you provide appears to be inaccurate in our sole discretion, if we suspect you have engaged in Credit farming (where a User or a group of Users create or use accounts to collect free Points in a systematic manner, or obtaining free Points by means of manipulation, deception or exploitation of programming errors), self-gifting (when a Streamer gives themselves virtual gifts, directly or indirectly, with their own account or a different second user account, whether be it their own profile or the profile of a third party controlled by the Streamer), group-gifting (when several Users cooperate and give each other virtual gifts with the main purpose of increasing their Diamond reward), or any other conduct similar in nature to the aforementioned conduct, fraud or other illegal activity, if we cannot verify your identity, or for any regulatory or legal reasons in our sole discretion.  You may cash out only once per day. We may change the minimum increments for redemption of Diamonds and frequency from time to time, and we reserve the right to do so at any time without notice. We will also determine the rate of redemption in our sole discretion and we may change the rate from time to time without notice.  The rate will be displayed at the point of redemption. You agree that we have the absolute right to manage, modify, and/or eliminate such redemption rights in our sole discretion. The cost of the virtual gifts that you give to another User may not correlate to the amount of Diamonds or the amount of cash reward such User is entitled to receive from us. You agree that we will have no liability to you, any other User, including without limitation a Streamer or any third-party based on our exercise of our rights with respect to the Diamonds and any redemption for cash reward.
We use one or more third-party vendors for cash redemption, and Streamers wishing to redeem Diamonds for cash must (1) have a valid account with the third-party vendor (if required), (2) must agree to the vendor’s Terms of Service, privacy policy and all other policies and procedures (“Third-Party Policies”), and (3) be responsible for any charges that the third-party vendor may impose.  You are responsible for all transaction fees in connection with the redemption. You understand that information submitted during the cash redemption process will be collected, used, and stored by the third-party vendor in accordance with the Third-Party Policies, and will not be under our control. You understand that we have no control over our third-party vendor’s practices, and you release TMG from any and all liability associated with information submitted to the third-party vendor, including, without limitation, liability related to the unauthorized release or use of your information or any other user information.
We reserve the right to verify your identity and eligibility to receive cash redemptions prior to payment.
Diamonds do not constitute property or money and are not transferable. All Diamonds in your account are forfeited if you delete your account or your account is blocked or deleted for any reason.
All Users who redeem Diamonds for cash rewards are solely responsible for the reporting and payment of any taxes due on the amounts redeemed.  You acknowledge and agree that we and our payment vendors may report any cash rewards you receive to the IRS or other applicable tax administrator.  To the extent we are required to withhold amounts under applicable law, you agree that we may do so.
You acknowledge and agree that we are not a money service business, money transmitter, depository institution or bank.
We agree to comply with applicable law, including U.S. trade control laws and U.S. sanctions laws and regulations. By agreeing to these terms, you represent and warrant that you (1) are not located or domiciled; do not have a place of business; and/or are not conducting business (any of which would make you a “ Resident”) in a jurisdiction in which access to or use of  Skout is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act, (2) are not a Resident of, or located in a jurisdiction that is subject to U.S. or other sovereign country sanctions or embargoes, and/or (3) are not an individual, or an individual employed by or associated with an entity, identified on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the U.S. Department of State’s Debarred Parties List. You agree that if your country of residence or other circumstances change such that the above representations are no longer accurate, you will immediately cease using Skout and we may refuse to deliver payments to you.
You acknowledge and agree that you are not an agent, employee or representative of TMG and the Agreement does not create nor may be construed as any employment relationship, joint venture or partnership with you and TMG.

10.  PHOTOSENTIVTIY WARNING: READ BEFORE PLAY
You may view livestreams of video game play or other visual content on Skout that may expose you to flashing lights or light patterns. A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures when exposed to certain flashing lights or lights patterns that may appear in video games or other visual content. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a computer screen, or while viewing livestreams of video game play or other visual content, may induce an epileptic seizure in these individuals. Certain conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms even in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy. If you, or anyone in your family, have an epileptic condition, consult your physician prior to viewing livestreams of video game play or content on Skout. If you experience any of the following symptoms while viewing livestreams of video game play or other content on Skout — dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement, or convulsions — IMMEDIATELY discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming your viewing.
11.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
YOU USE SKOUT AT YOUR SOLE RISK. WE PROVIDE SKOUT ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM OR THROUGH US SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TOS.
WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT SKOUT WILL ALWAYS BE SAFE, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT SKOUT WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DISRUPTIONS, DELAYS OR IMPERFECTIONS. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT (1)  SKOUT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (2)  SKOUT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (3) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM YOUR USE OF  SKOUT WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, (4) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH  SKOUT WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS, AND (5) ANY ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED.

YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLES (EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), AND INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION RESULTING FROM: (1) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE  SKOUT; (2) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM  SKOUT; (3) UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE, ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (4) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY USER OR THIRD PARTY ON  SKOUT; OR (5) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO  SKOUT.

15.  GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE
Unless prohibited by local law, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement of this Agreement (below) shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Any action to compel arbitration, or challenging the enforceability or applicability of the arbitration provisions herein, must be filed in the federal or state courts of Delaware. Any action filed in any other court shall be transferred to, or dismissed without prejudice for refiling only in, the federal or state courts of Delaware, after removal to the appropriate federal court, if applicable, for determination by the Delaware federal or state court as to whether the action should be stayed pending, or otherwise referred to, arbitration. Any claims that are not referred to arbitration must be adjudicated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Delaware. For such claims, the federal and state courts of Delaware shall have exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue over you and us, and you and we waive any objection based on inconvenient forum. If either party files suit in any court other than the federal or state courts of Delaware, in deciding whether to transfer or dismiss the action, or otherwise give effect to this provision, the court shall apply the standard set forth in Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas , 571 U.S. 49 (2013). The parties also agree that transfer or dismissal cannot be denied based on inconvenience to the parties, piecemeal adjudication of the claims, a risk of inconsistent findings of law or fact, the presence of other parties who are not party to these terms, or any other private or public consideration.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit a party’s right to seek equitable relief at any time. If the Arbitration Agreement (as set forth below) is held to be unenforceable, you and we agree that any claims or disputes that you or we have against each other must be resolved in the federal or state courts located in Delaware to the extent permissible by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims appropriately brought in small claims court may be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction. For the sake of clarity, the choice of Delaware law shall not exclude, limit or supersede a consumer’s rights or remedies under mandatory consumer protection laws in the jurisdiction where the consumer resides.
Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of Skout or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
16.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER
Purpose:
This section of the Agreement (henceforth referred to as “Arbitration Agreement”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any Disputes that may arise between you and The Meet Group, Inc. Arbitration is a form of private Dispute (as defined below) resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their Disputes and potential Disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such Dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.
Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and The Meet Group, Inc. shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your and our right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).
For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, “Skout” means the Meet Group, Inc. and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Skout regarding any aspect of your relationship with Skout, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver in this Arbitration Agreement). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.
YOU AND SKOUT EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution:
For all Disputes, you and we must first give each other an opportunity to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration. You must commence any Dispute you have with us by mailing written notification to The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) your phone number, (4) your email address used to create your MeeMe account, (5) a written description of the Dispute, (6) a description of the specific relief you seek, and (7) your personal signature. If Skout does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. We must commence any Dispute we have with you by sending you a written notification to the email address used to create your Skout account that includes a written description of the Dispute and a description of the specific relief we seek. If the Dispute is not resolved to our satisfaction within 45 days after you receive our written notification, we may pursue our Dispute in arbitration. Either party may communicate directly with the other in an effort to satisfy or resolve any Dispute, including by communicating any offers or demands. Arbitration Procedures: If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or Skout may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration. However, this shall not preclude the application of the Mass Filing section below. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement. For arbitration before the AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000 USD, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 USD or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. This Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. However, this shall not preclude the application of the Mass Filing section below.
In the event of a mass filing (defined in the section titled Mass Filing below), the procedures, fees, and costs described in the Mass Filing section will govern notwithstanding any applicable rule of the arbitration provider to the contrary.
Because your contract with Skout, the Agreement, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
Arbitration Award:
The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement. Location of Arbitration: The arbitration may be heard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as otherwise required by the arbitration provider’s rules, or in another location mutually agreed to by the parties. The parties may appear via teleconference as though they were appearing in person unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator.
Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs:
The initiating party must pay all filing fees that the arbitration provider requires to be paid by the initiating party. Your and our responsibility to pay other administrative and arbitrator fees and costs will also be as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is responsible for reimbursing the respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, filing, and/or other fees incurred as a result of the frivolous claim. The arbitration provider may also impose such obligation on the claimant’s attorneys. Fees, costs, and sanctions may also be awarded in the arbitration against a party of a party’s attorney as provided pursuant to applicable law. You may qualify for a waiver of certain arbitration costs under the arbitration provider’s rules or other applicable law. If you meet the standard for proceeding in forma pauperis in federal court, Delaware state court, or the courts of your state of residence, cannot obtain a waiver from the arbitration provider of any filing fees you are required to pay, and the arbitration provider refuses to administer the arbitration without your payment of said fees, Skout will pay the filing fees for you.
Class Action Waiver:
The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action), except as set forth in the Mass Filing section below, unless both you and Skout specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other member or user of the Skout services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding, except as set forth in the Mass Filing section below.
Limitation of Procedural Rights:
You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and Skout are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Skout might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). You and we give up those rights. Other rights that you or we would have if you or we went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.
Severability:
If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above and Mass Filing clause below) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver or Mass Filing clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.
Continuation:
This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with Skout and your use of the Skout services.
Mass Filing:
If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against us or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, or if we assert 25 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against similarly situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity (“Mass Filing”), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply:
Acknowledgment of Mass Filing Protocols.
If you or we, or you or your counsel, files a demand for arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you and we agree that the demand for arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection. If the parties disagree as to whether a series of filings fits within the definition of Mass Filing above, the arbitration provider shall resolve the disagreement. You and we also acknowledge that the adjudication of the dispute may be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time of filing of the demand for arbitration, and pending resolution of the bellwether proceedings.
Bellwether Arbitrations.
Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. The parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side), designated the “Initial Test Cases,” to proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be held in abeyance. This means that the filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other demands for arbitration in a Mass Filing, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other demands) will be in abeyance, and neither you nor Skout will be required to pay any such filing fees. You and Skout also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of this Arbitration Agreement for failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or other remedies, damages, or sanctions of any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this subsection, a party files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre- hearing conference.
Global Mediation.
Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims comprising the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test Cases until the Initial Test Cases and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test Cases, the mediator and the parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to resolve the outstanding cases. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Global Mediation, the remaining claims shall proceed in court unless the parties agree to an alternative procedure. You and we also acknowledge that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled pending resolution of the global mediation process.
Arbitration Provider’s Authority to Apply Mass Filing Rules.
Notwithstanding this Mass Filing section, if a series of arbitration demands is determined by the arbitration provider not to constitute a Mass Filing pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement, but such demands constitute a mass filing pursuant to the arbitration provider’s mass filing rules, the arbitration provider may apply its mass filing rules, procedures, and fees.
Enforcement of Subsection.
A Court of competent jurisdiction located in federal or state court in Delaware shall have the power to enforce this Mass Filing section.
Unavailability:
If for some reason AAA is not available to administer the arbitration and you live in California, the arbitration will be administered by ADR Services, Inc. pursuant to its then in-effect arbitration rules and procedures, available at https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration- rules/. If for some reason AAA is not available to administer the arbitration and you live outside of California, the arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation pursuant to its most current Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms, or under its most current Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitrations, as applicable, available at https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2021/12/SupplementalRules12.22.21.pdf. If none of these arbitration providers is available, including because it is not able to administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this arbitration agreement, including those regarding mass filings, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, with comparable fees and procedures for mass filings, if applicable. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5 that is able to administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this arbitration agreement, including those regarding mass filings, if applicable. If no such arbitration provider is available, the dispute shall be resolved in state or federal court in Delaware.

Participant Terms of Use
These Streamer Subscription Participant Terms of Use (“Streamer Subscription Participant Terms”) govern your (“you”, “your” or “Streamer Participant”) participation in the Streamer Subscription feature (the “Streamer Subscription”) within Skout (the “Platform”) provided by The Meet Group, Inc. (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By choosing to participate in the Streamer Subscription, you agree to these Streamer Subscription Participant Terms. These Streamer Subscription Participant Terms supplement our TOS and Community Guidelines  applicable, and any other terms that may be applicable from time to time, the provisions of which are incorporated by reference into these Streamer Subscription Participant Terms (together: “Terms”). In the event of any conflict between these Streamer Subscription Participant Terms and our Terms of Service, the Cash Redemption Terms or any other terms that may be applicable, the Streamer Subscription Participant Terms shall prevail, solely with respect to your participation in the Streamer Subscription and solely to the extent of the conflict.

Streamer Participant features may be subject to changes and remain in our sole discretion.
1.2.  Contractual relationship
By subscribing, the Subscriber forms a contractual relationship with us, not with you.  The contractual relationship and all rights and obligations between the Subscriber and us are exclusively governed by the contractual relationship existing between the Subscriber and us. You are not granted any rights against a Subscriber. In particular, it is not within the Subscriber’s discretion whether and to what extent you receive Diamonds.
Nothing in these Streamer Subscription Participant Terms will be deemed to create or be construed as creating any partnership, joint venture or employment relationship between you and us.
1.3.  Diamond Rewards

Residents of certain jurisdictions have additional rights under applicable privacy laws, as described in this section.
A.   GDPR
If you are a resident of the European Union, you have the following rights under GDPR provided that the legal requirements therein are met:
Right of access
– You may request information about the processing of your personal data and a copy of the personal data undergoing processing insofar as such copy does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others and no other exception applies.
Right to rectification
– You may request correction of your personal data that is inaccurate and/or completion of such data which is incomplete.
Right to erasure
– You may request deletion of your personal data, in particular where
the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed,
you have withdrawn your consent on which the processing was based and there is no other legal basis for the processing,
you objected to the processing which is based on the legal basis “legitimate interests” and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or you objected to the processing for direct marketing purposes,
your personal data has been unlawfully processed or
your personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.
The right to erasure, however, does not apply in particular where the processing of your personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Right to restriction of processing
– You may request restriction of processing
for the period in which we verify the accuracy of your personal data if you contested the accuracy of the personal data,
where the processing is unlawful and you request restriction of processing instead of erasure of the data,
where we no longer need the personal data, but you require the data for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, or
if you objected to processing which is based on the legal basis “legitimate interests” until it has been verified whether our legitimate grounds override your interests, rights, and freedoms.
Right to data portability
– You may request to receive your personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format and transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from us, where the processing is based on consent or the performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means; in these cases, you may also request to have the personal data transmitted directly to another controller where this is technically feasible.
Furthermore, you have the following rights:
Right to withdraw consent –
You may withdraw your consent at any time for the future where processing is based on your consent, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Right to object –
You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal data which is based on our or a third party’s legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). We then will no longer process your personal data for the purpose to which you have objected, unless we are able to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
Further, you have the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. Where you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will process your personal data no longer for such purposes.
Right to lodge a complaint –
You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of an alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR.

– You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal data. This right always applies but there are some exemptions to its application, which means you may not always receive all the information you have requested. When you request your personal data, this is known as making a data subject access request (DSAR). We may need to ask you for identification documentation in order to verify your identity on receipt of a DSAR from you.
Your right to rectification
– You have the right to ask us to rectify personal data you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.
Your right to erasure

To exercise the right of freedom of expression and information.
To comply with a legal obligation.
To perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority.
For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research, historical research or statistical purposes.
For the exercise or defence of legal claims.
Your right to restriction of processing
– You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. In such case, we will still hold the data but will not process it any further. This right is an alternative to the right to erasure. If one of the following conditions applies, you may exercise the right to restrict processing:
The accuracy of the personal data is contested.
Processing of the personal data is unlawful.
We no longer need the personal data for processing, but the personal data is required for part of a legal process.
The right to object has been exercised and processing is restricted pending a decision on the status of the processing.
Your right to object to processing – You have the right to object to processing in certain circumstances, including direct marketing. You can also object if the processing is on the basis of our legitimate interests (or those of a third party).
We then will no longer process your personal data for the purpose to which you have objected, unless we are able to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
Your right to data portability
– This right is the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format but only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or for the performance of a contract and the processing is automated.
Right to withdraw consent –
You may withdraw your consent at any time for the future where processing is based on your consent, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
