PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated May 01, 2024
Digitalchemy, LLC (“
Company
“, “
we
”, “
our
” or “
us
”) understands the importance of protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected when you download, install, register with, access, or use this mobile application (the “
App
”), and how such information will be used and shared. It also explains choices you have to control the collection, correction and/or deletion of such information.
This policy applies only to information we collect in our App and in e-mail, text and other electronic communications sent through or in connection with our App. This policy DOES NOT apply to information collected in other apps or websites (including third party websites you may access through the App), or information collected by any third party. These third parties may have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to read before providing information on or through them.
Should you not wish to have your information gathered or used as described in this policy, you may uninstall the App from the device(s) on which you have downloaded it.
MEMBERSHIP IN SELF-REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS
We are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (
http://www.aboutads.info/
), European Digital Advertising Alliance (
http://www.edaa.eu/
) and Japan Interactive Advertising Association (JIAA) (
http://www.jiaa.org/
). Therefore, we adhere to the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, the IAB Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioral Advertising, and JIAA Behavioral Targeting Advertising Guidelines.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE USE IT, AND THE LIMITED WAYS WE SHARE IT
User Data
When you use the App, you have the option of providing us with any of the following information, which we refer to as your “
User Data
”:
Your first name or preferred means of address;
Your email address;
Personal recordings, which could, depending on what was recorded, contain information which could on its own or together with other information, be used to personally identify you (“
Personally Identifiable Information
” or “
PII
”).
By default, your User Data will only be stored locally on the device from which you access the App. We cannot access your User Data if it is only stored on your device. If you so choose, you may elect to have up back-up your User Data, in which case we will upload it to Google Drive. Sound Recorder use and transfer to any app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the
Google API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
Your User Data is encrypted when stored in the cloud, and a limited number of our employees are the only individuals who may access it. If you elect to store your User Data in the cloud, we will ask you to provide a password to prevent unauthorized access to your User Data, and your email address so that you may reset your password if you forget it. If you choose to provide one. Other than these limited uses, we do not use the User Data you provide, and it is only provided to facilitate your own use of the App.
Voluntary Application Feedback
You may provide us with feedback regarding the App, either via reviews and rating in the app store, or via email. App Store reviews and ratings are posted in a public forum on app stores, we and the public can see them.  We take your feedback seriously, and often implement or incorporate user feedback. Email feedback is managed by our support staff, and neither your email nor your feedback is shared with third parties.
Analytics Data
Anonymous data, which we refer to as “
Analytics Data
,” regarding your use of our App is tracked and transmitted to us by our Apps themselves. Analytics Data consists of:
A device identifier enabling other issues on the same device to be located;
Crash logs, enabling application failures to be investigated; and
App interaction signals and event data, typically indicating when an application feature has been used in a certain way.
We use Analytics Data to fix and improve the App and evaluate features, including if and when users use different features, and how quickly new features are found. Analytics Data is anonymized, meaning it cannot be traced back to you. We process Analytics Data using Google Analytics, Firebase, and Microsoft App Center, but do not otherwise share it.
Service Provider Data
The application integrates with a third-party service to enhance functionality by allowing users to convert voice recordings into text. When you use the Voice to text feature, the voice recording you provide may be transferred to OpenAI for processing. We ensure that the data transferred is limited to what’s necessary for transcribing and does not include personally identifiable information.
We implement stringent measures to safeguard the transmission of your data to these third-party services. However, we cannot guarantee the security of data while it is in transit or when processed by third parties. We recommend using the service over secure network connections and avoiding sharing sensitive information in the recording you submit.
Our app does not store any data processed by OpenAI on its servers. However, the third-party service may store the data temporarily to provide the transcription service. We recommend that you review their respective privacy policies to understand their data storage, transmission, and security practices:
https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/
.
Advertising Data
Like many apps, our App is in part supported by advertising. Unless you opt-out, discussed more below, we may serve ads to you by transmitting to our select advertising partners a standard advertising identifier (an “
Advertiser ID
”) that we collect from your device. Advertising IDs are standard across the mobile advertising industry and are used to identify a particular device for advertising purposes. Advertising IDs are random identifiers that are generated by and tied to your mobile device. An example from a Google Android device looks like this: cdda802e-fb9c-46af-9846-0233d394c712.
Advertising IDs are typically generated once per device, so your device would always be associated with the same Advertising ID. Advertising IDs don’t contain any Personal Information in and of themselves. However, because they are typically static, a device will maintain the same Advertising ID over time, it is possible for third parties to use an Advertising ID in conjunction with location data they could collect from your device or from other apps you use, and other apps known to be associated with your device’s Advertising ID, to create inferences about you. Both Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android operating system provide a mechanism for users to reset or disable their device’s Advertising ID. If you elect to disable your Advertising ID, we respect that choice and will not send your device’s Advertising ID to our advertising partners.
Our Period Calendar applications transmit a device’s Advertising ID without adding any other Personal Information or other additional information. We believe this results in an excellent user experience with relevant and helpful advertising, while also protecting your privacy and safety.
Purchase Data
When you purchase a subscription or other in-app item from the Apple App Store or Google Play store, that transaction is processed by the relevant app store, and not by our Company. We have no access to your payment instruments and can see only the very limited view of the transaction shared with us by the app store. The limited data we receive consists of an order ID generated by the app store, price information, the date and time of the purchase, and may in some cases contain your ZIP code of the purchaser. This limited purchase data is only used by our support staff to request refunds for you when appropriate, and is not shared with any third party.
The uses above enumerate the limited ways in which we use the information provided by or collected from you and your mobile device when you use our App. If we are required to, we may also use your Personal Information to respond to a valid and enforceable court order, law, or legal process.
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, restructuring, or other sale or transfer of all or any portion of our assets or business, that could involve your Personal Information and User Data being transferred to the buyer or surviving entity. We value your privacy, and we will, if allowed, use reasonable efforts to notify you when your Personal Information is transferred, by posting such notice on our website or the App, and/or by contacting you if you have provided us with an email address. In the event of a transfer of Personal Information, we will instruct the buyer, surviving entity, or other third party recipient that absent your permission to do otherwise it may only use your Personal Information covered by this Privacy Policy in accordance with this Privacy Policy, even after the transfer. However, following such transfer we cannot guarantee or enforce that any such third-party will abide by our instruction. Any new information you provide after any such transfer will likely be subject to a new policy, and you should review that policy.
THIRD PARTY INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE FOR ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING
When you use the App on an Apple or Android mobile device, certain third parties may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about you or your device. These third parties may include advertisers, ad networks, ad servers, and analytics companies.
The Company provides the advertising ID generated by the Apple or Android mobile device (which is a non-persistent identifier of your device that you can reset at any time) and may also provide real-time location data, usage data, or other information related to your use of the App and other services via your mobile device (but will not provide your name, or your email address,) to these third-party ad servers or ad networks (“Advertisers”). Advertisers may also use tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the App. Advertisers may collect information about online activities over time and across different websites, apps and other online services websites under a specific advertising ID. Advertisers may use this information (including the information we provide to them) to provide interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content to your mobile device.
The App includes the use of the following services:

We do not control all of the Advertisers’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should consult the respective privacy policies of the Advertisers. This Company privacy policy does not apply to the Advertisers further mentioned. For information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising, see “Choices About Your Information” below.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
The Company uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your data. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through our App. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.
CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us. This section describes mechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of your information.
Advertising IDs.
An advertising ID is a non-persistent, resettable identifier of your device that is used for purposes of online behavioral advertising. The advertising ID associated with your device is created and managed by Apple or Google, depending on whether you have an iOS or Android device. You may object to the transfer of the aforementioned information at any given time with immediate, future effect by adjusting the settings on your mobile device to disable the Apple-Ad-Tracking via IFDA or to opt out of interest-based ads via the Google advertising ID. The mechanism for opting of out of interest-based ads is different for each device, so please consult the user manual for your device’s operating system for specific instructions. Additionally or alternatively, you can reset your advertising ID at any time (and as frequently as you would like), which causes Google’s or Apple’s system to build your device’s profile for advertising purposes anew, so that advertisers cannot link your activities taking place prior to the reset to your device.
Other Tracking Technologies.
Depending on your device, you may be able to adjust the settings of your device to disable or refuse app cookies and/or other tracking technologies. If you disable or refuse cookies or block the use of other tracking technologies, some parts of the App may then be inaccessible or not function properly. Please note that we do not access your device’s do-not-track settings, and we therefore do not respond to such settings. Third party advertisers, ad networks, and ad servers that display ads in our App may, however, access and respond to your device’s and browsers’ do-not-track signals; if you would like to know how a third party advertiser responds to do-not-track signals sent by your device or browser, please consult their privacy policy.
Targeted Advertising by Third Parties.
We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. In general, to find out more about how to opt out of receiving targeted ads from a particular advertiser click on the AdChoices icon  or link (or similar icon or link) appearing in or near the ad. You can also opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of certain ad networks as follows:
If the Advertiser is a member of or advertises through:

You can stop all collection of information by the App by uninstalling the App. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the App’s marketplace or network.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
As noted above, we do not sell or share any User Data. We may, however, provide Advertising IDs from your device to Advertisers. Under certain laws, including California law, the provision of Advertising IDs may constitute a sale of Person Information. As discussed above, you may at any given time with immediate, future effect by adjusting the settings on your mobile device to, depending on your operating system, disable the Apple-Ad-Tracking via IFDA or to opt out of interest-based ads via the Google advertising ID. Please see the
Choices About Your Information
section above for more information.
In addition, if you are a California resident, you have the right to request information from us regarding the ‎manner in which we share certain categories of your Personal Information with third parties. ‎Specifically, California law provides you the right to submit a request to us at the designated address in the
Contact Us
section below, or via the Contact page on
https://www.digitalchemy.us/contact
or by email at soundrecorderplus@digitalchemy.us, to ‎request that we:‎
Disclose to you the following information covering the 12-month period prior to your request:
The categories of Personal Information we collected about you and the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting Personal Information about you;
The categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Information about you, and the categories of Personal Information disclosed;
The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;
Delete the Personal Information we collected from you; and
Correct Personal Information we collected from you.
You are entitled to receive a copy of this information in a standardized format and the ‎information will not be specific to you individually. In addition, you have the right to be free from discrimination by a business for exercising these rights.
Under California law, you also have a right to know that, as described in
The Information We Collect, How We Use It, And The Limited Ways In Which We Share It
section above:
In the last 12-month we have collected the following categories of Personal Information:
Personal unique identifiers, when you provide us with a name or other preferred means of address;
Personal information, when you provide us with an email address, if we receive a zip code from an app store, or if you upload personal health information such as information about your cycle or sexual activity; and
Biometric information, when you provide us with information about medicines taken, temperatures, or measurements;
In the last 12 months we have shared Personal Information for a business purpose when:
users elect to have their User Data stored in the cloud and we send such data to Google Cloud; and
we provide anonymized Analytics Data to Google Analytics; and
In the last 12 months, unless you have opted-out, as described above, we have provided your device’s Advertising ID to our Advertisers, which may be considered a “sale” or Personal Information.
DATA SUBJECTS IN THE EU
If you are located in the EU when using our services, the following information is relevant for you: To contact our Data Protection Officer, you may send an email to soundrecorderplus@digitalchemy.us with the subject ATTN: DPO. Through the use of SDKs, we allow our advertising partners in the US to collect non-PII data, which they store and use for targeting. The data recipients are regularly self-certified under the EU/US Privacy Shield (if located in the US) or may have agreed with us to apply the EU Model Clauses Controller to Controller or Controller to Processor. All three measures have been accepted by the European Commission under an Adequacy Decision as ensuring a sufficient level of data protection. The legal basis of the processing of the information is Art. 6 para 1 lit a) GDPR, your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any given time with future effect by following the withdrawal mechanisms described in the Privacy Policies of our partners, the Opt-Out procedures provided by the DAA, EIDAA and Google Adds described above, modifying the Settings in the app(s) you use or by uninstalling the app. You are not obliged to provide your information to us, neither by operation of law nor contract. If you do not provide consent to us, we will not be able to personalize your ads or measure your use of our services. You have the right to request access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and restriction of processing as well as a right to data portability and you may always lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy in our sole discretion. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will make the updated privacy policy available from within the App. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

We use and deploy digital identifiers to automatically collect certain information. Some of this information may identify a particular computer or device and may be considered Personal Information.
We obtain such information by using digital identifiers. You can find more information on our digital identifiers below:
Beacons, Pixels and Tags: Beacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, on websites by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page.
A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.
Mobile SDK: A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a beacon or tag (see Beacons and Tags above). The SDK is a piece of computer code that publishers include in their apps to enable ads to be shown and to enable related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, including by collecting and analyzing data which is available through the device on which the mobile SDK is installed.
Cookie: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.
Non-Cookie Technology: Today’s online world is becoming increasingly complex, with a proliferation of new devices, software platforms, online services and other technology. As such, cookies are not always available. Therefore, companies are using alternative methods to distinguish devices. For example, some platforms, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising. Most mobile devices are assigned unique identifiers that also may be used to distinguish devices. Additionally, it is possible to use mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses about recognizing devices.

We are already seeing
incredible lift and increases in revenue
across our top titles, which allows us to invest more in user acquisition.
Dmitry Shelengovskiy
CEO, Playgendary
“
AppLovin made it easy to migrate to MAX and we saw immediate improvements by switching, including a 30% ARPDAU lift on iOS. We were surprised to achieve this much of an improvement without additional optimizations. And even after, the AppLovin team continued to help us with additional tools, integrations, and testing, which drove our total revenue even higher.
