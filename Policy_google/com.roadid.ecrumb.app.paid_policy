ROAD ID'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY (written by the Owners)
Legally, we're required to issue and adhere to a fancy legalistic privacy policy. Our philosophy on privacy, however, is far simpler than all the legal mumbo jumbo that our attorneys so kindly drafted (below). We, the owners of Road ID, place a great value on our own personal privacy and security. We believe that your personal information is just as important as our own. So, we absolutely refuse to share your personal information with any unauthorized business, organization, or individual. We promise.

Privacy Policy
ROAD iD'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY (WRITTEN BY THE OWNERS)
According to our over-dressed and uncomfortably-uptight legal counsel, we're required to issue a fancy and legal-jargon-infused privacy policy. Our stance on privacy, however, is far simpler than the legalese that our attorneys drafted (below). It’s simply this:
The entire ROAD iD team and I place a great value on our own personal privacy and security. We believe that your personal information is just as important as our own. As such, it is our duty to protect it. So, we absolutely refuse to share your personal information with any unauthorized business, organization, or individual. Seriously. Promise.

We may collect and process the following categories of PII about you:
Communication Data

This includes data stored in persistent cookies when you login to the Website and analytics data that is collected when you use the Website. We collect and process this data to operate the Website, to provide products or services to you, to authenticate you as a user of the Website, to ensure that timely and relevant content is provided to you, to secure the Website, to ensure that the Website operates in a fast and efficient manner, and to maintain backups of the Website.

ROAD iD does not collect any other personally sensitive data.
ROAD iD will only use your PII for the purpose for which it was collected. In the event that ROAD iD needs to use your PII for an unrelated new purpose, ROAD iD will provide you with notice of this new use and will explain the lawful ground for such processing. ROAD iD may process your PII without your knowledge or consent where required or permitted by law.
ROAD iD does not use your PII to automatically make any decisions or to create an automated profile about you.
2.
Collection of Data From Third Parties
.
ROAD iD may collect data about you through cookies and other technologies. This helps ROAD iD understand how you use the Website and to understand any patterns that may be associated with your use of the Website. This aids ROAD iD in developing or improving its Website in response to your needs or wants.
ROAD iD may use session or persistent cookies.

Persistent cookies are stored as a file on your computer or mobile device that remains on your computer or mobile device even after you close your web browser. Persistent cookies can be read by the website that created the cookie when you revisit it again.

3.
Protected Health Information
.
ROAD iD may allow you to submit certain confidential healthcare information, known as Protected Health Information (“PHI”), to ROAD iD when you use the Website for the purposes of placing that PHI on the products that ROAD iD sells. Though ROAD iD is not a “covered entity” or “business associate” under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, ROAD iD desires to disclose to you how it secures, stores, and discloses your PHI. Your PHI may be stored electronically and is subject to electronic disclosure.
ROAD iD may use your PHI solely for the purposes of providing you with the products it sells. ROAD iD will not disclose your PHI to any third party except in the following situations:
ROAD iD may disclose your PHI when required by law, such as upon receipt of a duly authorized request from an administrative agency, subpoena, or court order;
ROAD iD may disclose your PHI to law enforcement officials in limited situations, such as when it is required to respond to a warrant or upon a proper exigent circumstances request; and
ROAD iD may disclose your PHI to law enforcement officials as necessary to avert a serious threat to the health and safety of you or any other person.
ROAD iD does not sell your PHI. Your PHI is received and stored in a highly-secured and encrypted format and with 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. ROAD iD takes the security of your PHI very seriously and is fully committed to protecting it. However, no security measures can guarantee perfect security and you submit your PHI at your own risk.
4.
Marketing Communications
.
As stated above, ROAD iD’ lawful ground for sending you marketing communications is either consent or its legitimate business interests, such as to grow its business by advertising products to you. ROAD iD may send you marketing communications if you have asked for information concerning its goods or services or if you have agreed to, and have not opted out from, receiving marketing communications. You may ask ROAD iD to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out link in any marketing message sent to you. If you opt out of receiving marketing communications, your opt-out does not extend to PII provided for other purposes.
ROAD iD may provide you with the ability to receive marketing text messages from ROAD iD. ROAD iD provides you with the opportunity to opt-in and opt-out from text messages, including by responding to the initial text message that you received from ROAD iD when you opted in to receive text messages. By replying YES to this message, you understand that you confirm your subscription to ROAD iD text messages.
The frequency of text messages from ROAD iD may vary. ROAD iD does not charge for providing its text message services, but your mobile telephone carrier may charge message and data rates. By consenting to receive text messages from ROAD iD, you approve of any charges applied by your mobile telephone carrier. ROAD iD reserves the right to terminate text message services at any time and within its sole and absolute discretion.
To stop receiving text messages, you may text STOP in response to any text message received from ROAD iD. To obtain help regarding text messages sent by ROAD iD, you may email
ErinE@roadid.com
.
5.
Disclosure of Personal Information
.
ROAD iD may share your PII with the following parties:
Service providers that provide ROAD iD with information technology or other administrative services;
ROAD iD’s accountants, auditors, insurers, or attorneys;
Law enforcement agencies upon the receipt of a subpoena or court order or where necessary to protect ROAD iD’s personnel or property; and
Government bodies that require ROAD iD to report its processing activities.
ROAD iD may also transfer PII to third parties when it sells, transfers, or merges any part of its business or assets.
ROAD iD requires all third parties that receive a transfer of PII from ROAD iD to maintain the same level of respect for the protection of PII as ROAD iD and ROAD iD only allows third parties to process your personal data for the specific purposes listed in this Privacy Policy.
6.
Data Security
.
ROAD iD has put into place data security measures to protect your PII. ROAD iD allows access to your PII only by employees and service providers who have a need to know or on ROAD iD’ instructions. However, no security measures are impenetrable and there are always security risks. ROAD iD will notify you and any regulatory body of any breach of your PII or ROAD iD’s security measures, if it is legally required to do so.
7.
Retention of Data
.
ROAD iD will only retain your PII for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected under this Privacy Policy or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We will also retain and use your PII to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
8.
Right to Access, Rectification, Correction, Erasure, Transfer, and Withdrawal
.
Under the law, you may have a right to request access to your PII for rectification, correction, erasure, transfer, or restriction, or to object to its processing or withdraw your consent. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact ROAD iD’s Privacy Compliance Officer as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
You do not need to pay a fee to access your PII or to exercise your rights. However, ROAD iD may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unreasonable or excessive.
To confirm your request, ROAD iD may need to request specific information from you as a security measure to ensure that PII is not disclosed to an unauthorized third party. ROAD iD will attempt to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty (30) days.
9.
California Privacy Rights
.
The following rules apply solely to visitors, users, and others who are residents of the State of California. California residents have the right to be notified which categories of PII are being collected and the purposes for which the PII is being used. In particular, we collected the following categories of PII (A, B, D, and F) as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act within the last twelve months. Our uses of this PII are detailed above in this Privacy Policy:
Category
Examples
Collected
A. Identifiers
Real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, or other similar identifiers.
YES
B. Personal information categories listed in the California Consumer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))
Name, signature, address, telephone number, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, along with health information voluntarily provided to ROAD iD.
YES
D. Commercial
Records of products purchased.
YES
F. Internet or other similar network activity
Browsing history, search history, information on a consumer’s interaction with a website, application, or advertisement.
YES
We obtain these categories of PII directly from California residents when they complete forms through our website or provide it to us as a part of a transaction or inquiry concerning our products. We also obtain these categories of PII indirectly from California residents while observing their actions on our Website and from third parties or service providers that they have authorized to receive and share PII.
California residents have a right to request that we disclose what PII we collect from you and whether, and how, we disclose or sell that PII. California residents may also request that we delete any personal information collected or maintained by us from you.
ROAD iD does not sell your PII. Despite this, California law requires us to disclose to you that California residents have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information by contacting us or, where available, by clicking a link or icon associated with an advertisement. Specifically, this link or icon may state “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” or “Do Not Sell My Info.” By selecting this link or icon, you “Opt Out,” which means that you have opted out of the sale of your personal information as set forth in the California Consumer Privacy Act. However, even though you may have opted out, you may still see interest-based advertisements. To learn more about interest-based advertising across websites and additional opt-out choices, you can visit
http://optout.aboutads.info
. If you opt-out of the sale of your personal information but do not opt out of interest-based advertising more generally, you may still receive ads tailored to your interests based on PII that was not sold by us, personal information that was sold to downstream participants at least 90 days before you opted out, or personal information that was sold by other sources from which you have not opted out.
To submit a request for a list of the categories of personal information collected from you or to request that ROAD iD delete your personal information, please email us at
ErinE@roadid.com
or send a letter to us at the following address:
ROAD iD

Covington, KY 41011
To verify your request, we may request certain information from you to confirm that you are a ROAD iD user, such as your phone number, username, email address, city, state, or geographic location. You may also designate an authorized agent to make a request to ROAD iD to disclose or delete your personal information. To do so, you must provide ROAD iD with proof that the individual or business has been appointed as your agent, such by providing a signed power of attorney form, and provide accurate responses to any information requested by ROAD iD that may be necessary to confirm that you are a ROAD iD user, such as your phone number, username, email address, city, state, or geographic location. California residents have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by ROAD iD for their exercise of these rights conferred under California law.
10.
Third Party Links
.
ROAD iD’s website may include links to third party websites and applications. By clicking on third party links, you may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. ROAD iD does not control these third-party links and you are advised to review their respective privacy policies.
11.
Responding to Do Not Track Signals
.
You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. Our website is not currently set up to respond to browser do-not-track signals because there is no consensus within the advertising industry as to what “do not track” means in this context, but you can configure your browser settings to reject all cookies or prompt you before a cookie is set.
12.
Nevada Residents
.
If you are a resident of Nevada, you may provide notice to us to limit the sale of your PII to third parties for resale or licensing purposes. However, we do not sell your PII for such use. To notify us that you wish to limit the sale of your PII to third parties for resale or licensing purposes, you may send us an email to
ErinE@roadid.com
with the subject line, “Nevada Do Not Sell Request,” along with your name, address, and user account information.
13.
Children’s Privacy
.
We do not direct the Website to anyone under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of an individual under the age of 13 and believe that we may have collected PII from your child, please contact us at
ErinE@roadid.com
.
14.
Notification of Changes
.
Whenever ROAD iD changes its Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website and other places that we deem appropriate. Your use of the ROAD iD Website following these changes indicates your consent to the practices described in the revised Privacy Policy.
