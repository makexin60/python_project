Our Privacy Policy applies to and governs all websites, games,
              online services, and software made available at all websites owned
              and operated by World of Neopia, Inc. (collectively, the “Sites”
              and, individually, “Site”), on mobile devices, tablets, personal
              computers and other devices. By accessing any of the Sites, you
              are consenting to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy
              describes what information the Sites collect from users, including
              children, when they visit the Sites; how such information is used
              and stored; when such information may be disclosed to third
              parties; how users, parents, and guardians can control the use and
              disclosure of collected information; and how information is
              protected.
Our users’ privacy is important to us, and
              we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protection for
              children on the Sites permitting such users. Our privacy practices
              are guided by California Consumer Privacy Act, and as amended and
              the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of
              1998, as well as all applicable data privacy laws in the United
              States. In all cases, younger users should always check with their
              parents or guardians before entering information on any website or
              mobile application and we encourage families to discuss their
              household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal
              information. In order for a child to fully participate on any of
              the Sites, no personally identifiable information is collected
              from a child until such time as verifiable parental or guardian
              consent is received from the child’s parent or guardian. In order
              to register on our site as a user, the child’s parent or guardian
              must activate their account. Users may choose to play as Guests
              without the collection of information, recording of game play,
              prizes or gems when users return.

What We Share:
Depending upon the circumstances and to the extent as
                      permitted by the applicable laws of California, we may
                      share collected information with:
Law enforcement or others as needed to protect or defend
                        our rights and the rights of others;
Third parties we hire to handle certain activities;
Advertisers or third parties with whom we may partner to
                        provide you additional content, products or services;
Business partners who sponsor a sweepstakes or contest
                        or who jointly offer a service or feature on the Sites;
Within the World of Neopia family of companies;
In the event of a corporate transaction; and
Otherwise with your consent.
We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use
                      your personal information for any other purpose, and that
                      they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security
                      and integrity of the personal information they obtain from
                      us.
Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of
                      third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we
                      cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy
                      and security procedures as World of Neopia.
Our sites may also have message boards and/or chat areas,
                      where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one
                      another. When posting to a message board or chat area,
                      please be aware that the information is being made
                      publicly available online and the user does so at his or
                      her own risk.
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
: We do not “sell” your personal information that
                      directly identifies you. However, the CCPA’s broad
                      definitions of “sale” and “personal information” may deem
                      the common flow of information in the digital analytics
                      and advertising ecosystem to be a sale. We use online
                      analytics to measure the ways users engage with our
                      websites and apps. These analytics, in turn, inform how we
                      perform online advertising. In order to provide these
                      analytics and facilitate online advertising, we use
                      third-parties that collect device identifiers and place
                      tags, cookies, beacons, and similar tracking mechanisms on
                      our Sites.
To the extent that we sell your personal information, you
                      may have the right to direct us to stop selling your
                      personal information if we do so. Please contact us if you
                      wish to exercise this right.

                      sharing practices, please go

Who Else Is Collecting
                    Information:
We may use a number of advertising networks, analytics
                      service providers and other such companies to, for
                      example, serve advertisements or analyze the performance
                      of the Sites. These companies may use their own unique
                      identifiers, and their use of these technologies is within
                      their control and not ours. These companies may use the
                      information they collect from you consistent with their
                      own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
For more information about these third parties and how you
                      might be able to control how they use your information,

How You Can Control Your Own
                    Information:

                        information about enhancements, new products, promotions

                        send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within
                        them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.
You may have choices about the use of your information
                        by third parties wishing to deliver certain targeted

I. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.
We may request or collect certain information when you visit the
              Sites. However, users are required to share only the information
              that is reasonably necessary to participate in the particular
              activity.
A. Registration Information:
The information required to register varies by Site, but may
              include: (a) birth date; (b) gender; (c) country; (d) state; (e)
              zip code; (f) user name and password; (g) wireless telephone
              number; (h) email address; and (i) other profile information such
              as avatar preferences, communications preferences, and interests.
              Children under the age of thirteen (13) may be asked to provide
              his or her parent's or guardian's email address. Users or their
              parents/guardians will receive an activation email and must follow
              the procedures or otherwise agree to the terms within the
              activation email within a certain time period to activate the
              account. Accounts not activated within that time period will be
              deleted. Included in the activation email is a verifiable parental
              or guardian consent form that may be completed by a child’s parent
              or guardian permitting the collection of certain personally
              identifiable information or allowing the child to enter certain
              free entry text on the Sites.
Registration information is used to enable users to take advantage
              of site offerings; respond to user’s requests for products,
              services, and information; manage games; serve appropriate
              material; customize the content you see when you visit the Sites;
              and offer users special offers and promotions from the Sites and
              World of Neopia' companies and its subsidiaries and affiliates as
              well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products,
              programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.
B. Computer Information Collected by
                Us:
When users come to a Site, we may automatically collect certain
              information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the
              type of computer operating system, the user's IP address, the web
              browser, UDID (for certain mobile devices), information about the
              websites visited before and after visiting the Site, the web pages
              and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Sites,
              interactions with e-mail messages sent by a Site or World of
              Neopia' companies (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages
              were opened or forwarded), information collected through the use
              of unique identifiers such as cookies (see below), information
              regarding the internet service provider, and other standard server
              log information ("Computer Information").
We may use cookies, web beacons, tokens or similar technologies
              (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) on the
              Sites. "Cookies" are text files that help store user preferences
              and activity. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web
              bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data,
              such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising
              responses. “Tokens” are unique persistent identifiers that are
              generated and sent from a server to a user’s device to identify an
              interaction session, such as the authentication for a user’s cable
              provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie.
              The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to
              collect Computer Information automatically as you browse the Site
              and the web.
We may use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow
              users to move between certain Sites without logging into each
              Site, enable the internal functioning of the Sites, understand
              Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content,
              offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your
              experience on the Site (for example, to recognize you by name when
              you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email
              messages originating from the Sites or World of Neopia' companies
              (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened
              or forwarded), save your password, save your online game or video
              player settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer
              you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you,
              deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Sites.
              These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and
              additional other information regarding your visits to the Sites
              (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features,
              purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other
              information across multiple sessions on the Sites and other
              websites offered by World of Neopia' companies and may also
              collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the
              device you use to access the Site (“Identifier”). An Identifier
              may be automatically assigned to any device you use to access the
              Sites.
By visiting a Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you
              acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us
              your consent to set and access Cookies on your device and track
              your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking
              Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use in the emails we
              send to you.
While none of our Sites track our users for behavioral advertising
              purposes we feel it is important for our users to be aware of
              their choices when it comes to their online privacy. Click
here
for more information about online behavioral advertising.
              World of Neopia does not use any behaviorally target advertising
              on our sites.
Our Third Party Advertising Service Providers (as defined in
              Section C) do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the
              Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the
              Site. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as
              advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking
              Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking
              Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if
              you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access
              to other information about you.
You have a number of options with respect to the Tracking
              Technologies set by the Sites.  You may be able to have
              the device you use to access the Sites warn you each time a cookie
              or other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash
              cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings. This is
              done through your browser on the device you use to access the
              Sites. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings
              may be available through your browser’s support feature.
Please be aware that certain areas and features of the Sites can
              only be accessed in conjunction with Tracking Technologies, and
              that disabling Tracking Technologies might prevent you from
              accessing such content.
C. Computer Information Collected By
                Others:
The Sites may use the services of
              third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information,
              IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of
              users who visit the Sites.
The Sites use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data
              exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing
              analytics service providers, and other third-party service
              providers (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service
              Providers”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Sites,
              facilitate targeting of advertisements, or measure and analyze
              advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Sites (“Targeting
              Services”) in an aggregate and anonymous form.
These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access
              to Tracking Technologies set by the Sites except to the extent
              necessary to provide services to the Sites. The Third Party
              Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may
              themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your
              device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your
              browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them)
              and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about
              you. In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may
              collect aggregate log data separately and independently from what
              the Sites collect.
You should be aware that different rules might apply to the
              collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties
              in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other
              websites you encounter on the internet. The use of such technology
              by these third parties is within their control and not the Sites.
              Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not
              control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your
              information and those sites may use the information they collect
              from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we
              encourage you to review. We are not responsible for any action or
              omission by the third parties in relation to the collection, use
              or disclosure of cookie information, IP addresses, identifiers or
              other personal information collected by the third party. We
              encourage you to research and direct any of your questions in this
              regard to these third parties.
Some of these Providers and Advertisers may participate in the
              Network
Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool
and/or the
Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising
. Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about
              your choices.
Please note the following with respect to opting out of Tracking
              Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and
              advertisers:
The opt-out tools discussed above are “cookie based.”
This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your
                choices with respect to the use of your information by the
                parties that offer you those choices. If you opt-out but then
                use the controls in your browser to delete all Tracking
                Technologies, you may have to opt-out again, a second time, in
                order to re-establish your opt-out preferences.
Opt-outs are browser-specific.
This means,
                for example, that if you opt out while using a particular
                internet browser, this choice will not affect the collection of
                information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use
                another internet browser on the same device. It also means that
                opting out on one device will not affect the collection of
                information by Tracking Technologies on other devices you may
                use to access the Sites.
Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off
                Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies
                does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.
                Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off
                Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies
                only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your
                specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to
                see ads on the Sites.
Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may
              transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the
              browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers
              incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear
              whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or
              whether they even are aware of them. There currently is
              disagreement, including among participants in the leading internet
              standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything,
              websites should do when they receive such signals.
We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but,
              if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may
              reassess how to respond to these signals.
D. Contests and Sweepstakes:
The Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes. To enter
              these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide
              your first name and email address and/or additional information
              required for the management of the contest or sweepstakes. For
              children under the age of 13, we may collect the child’s e-mail
              address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store
              such child’s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes,
              and use it for notification if he or she is the
              winner following the child’s parent or guardian’s consent.
              For contests or sweepstakes on such sites, we may ask for the
              email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the
              parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent
              or guardian the option to have the child's entry deleted.
E. Electronic Postcards and Messages:
The Sites may provide users the
              opportunity to send electronic postcards and “wish lists” of items
              they want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the
              user’s behalf, email messages to family and/or friends. To do so,
              users must provide the email address of the recipient of such
              electronic postcards or email messages. Users must only provide
              email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive
              such electronic postcards or email messages. Email addresses
              provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the
              requested postcard or email message and are anonymized and deleted
              from our system once the postcard or message is sent. In some
              cases, we may offer users an incentive (e.g., points to be used in
              an online game) for referring information about products to the
              user's family or friends. In such cases, we will comply with all
              applicable legal requirements. Please note that this feature may
              not be available to users in certain regions or countries.
F. Electronic Newsletters:
Users can provide their email
              addresses to receive email newsletters and promotions from World
              of Neopia' companies, and our business partners. Users may change
              their preferences regarding emails at any time through the
              unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for certain Sites, by
              logging into and changing the preferences for their account.
G. Interactive Features and Services:
Some of the Sites may offer
              interactive features and services, such as message boards, chat
              rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes, messaging
              services, and member profile pages. For a user who is a child
              under the age of 13 years, we either will obtain parental consent
              before allowing the child to use these interactive features and
              services or will use reasonable technical measures to anonymize
              and delete all personal information from a child’s postings before
              they are made public and also anonymize and delete such
              information from our records. We use the information collected
              through interactive features and services to enable you to
              participate in such features and services.
H. Wireless Marketing Services:
Consistent with local law, appropriately aged users may have the
              opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news,
              programming and information delivered via text messaging and/or
              wireless devices. To do so, users may be asked to provide their
              telephone number, email address, carrier’s name, and/or their
              opinion regarding certain goods and/or services. Users must opt in
              to receive wireless marketing material from businesses within
              World of Neopia companies through one of the following methods:
              (a) filling out the registration information on any The Sites’
              wireless marketing registration page; or (b) sending a specific
              word, code or symbol via a text message to a telephone number
              designated by us in any promotional material. The user may also be
              asked to confirm his or her acceptance to receive such wireless
              marketing services.
Users that register for wireless marketing services acknowledge,
              understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's
              wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from the Sites
              or World of Neopia' companies. Standard messaging rates will
              apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will World
              of Neopia' companies be responsible for any wireless email or text
              messaging charges incurred by such user or by a person that has
              access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email
              address.
I.
Geolocation
Information:
We may collect and store
              information about your geographic location, but we will only
              collect precise geolocation information sufficient to
              identify street name and name of a city or town on the Sites that
              either are directed to users over the age of 13 and only
              if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location
              information. You may be able to change the settings on your
              computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with
              such information. We use this information, for example, to enable
              users to take advantage of Site offerings; respond to user’s
              requests for products, services, and information; manage games;
              customize the content users see when visiting the Sites; and to
              offer users special offers and promotions from The Sites and World
              of Neopia' companies, as well as on behalf of selected third
              parties offering products, programs or services that we believe
              may be of interest to our users. By accepting this Privacy Policy
              and using the applicable Site, you hereby consent to the
              collection and storage of such geolocation information as
              described above. You have the right to limit our use and
              disclosure of your precise geolocation information to certain
              enumerated business purposes under the laws of California. To make
              a request, please send an e-mail to
privacy@neopets.com
.
J. Financial Information:
We collect and use financial information, such as credit card
              numbers and security codes, for the limited purposes described
              below.
Consumer Products
: Certain Sites provide pages
                and/or links to pages offering users who are of legal age to
                form a binding contract the opportunity to purchase consumer
                products (the "Shops"). To do so, users need to provide contact,
                shipping, billing and credit information. These pages may be
                hosted and operated by a third party that is independent and
                separate from the Sites. The third party collects personal
                information about shop users and may share this information with
                us. We use this information to process the order and to send
                order confirmations via email, as well as to send information
                about products and services of interest and as otherwise
                required by law. Before providing information on these pages, we
                encourage you to review the posted privacy policies which govern
                such third party’s use of your information, as they may differ
                from ours.
Virtual Items/Memberships
: Some of the Sites
                may offer memberships, online subscriptions and/or virtual items
                for use in conjunction with the Sites' games. When you enter
                into a transaction for a membership, subscription, virtual item
                or similar transaction, you may be asked to provide the credit
                card and/or billing information and email address. We will use
                this information to fulfill your specified requests, as well as
                to inform you about additional products or service opportunities
                and as otherwise required by law.  Please also see the
                information regarding payment processors in Section II(B) below.
K. Other Data Collection and Use.
We collect search query information when users search for
              information on the Sites. We also collect information from users
              when they contact us with questions and comments.
We may use this information, along with any of the other
              information described above, to (i) analyze use of the Sites and
              understand and improve our service offerings; (ii) prevent
              potentially prohibited or illegal activities; and (iii) for any
              other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your
              information or pursuant to your consent.
We may combine information collected through the Sites with
              information we collect from other sources (e.g., social media
              integration services), other World of Neopia' company’s sites,
              offline records or publicly available information). It is your
              responsibility to provide complete and accurate information and to
              keep such information up to date. We are not responsible for any
              problem or liability arising from your failure to do so.
II. DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES
We may share your information with third parties for the limited
              purposes described below. In the U.S., parents and guardians of
              children under the age of 13 have the option of consenting to the
              collection and use of their child's personal information without
              consenting to the disclosure of that information to certain third
              parties.
A. Law Enforcement and Safety.
You acknowledge, consent, and agree
              to the extent legally permissible in your jurisdiction to allow us
              to access, preserve, and/or disclose the information we collect
              and/or content you provide to us (including information you may
              have posted on bulletin boards or internal site communication
              systems) to a law enforcement agency or other third parties if
              required to do so by law or with a good faith belief that such
              access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
              (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms of Use of the
              respective The Sites; (c) respond to claims that the content
              violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests
              for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or
              personal safety of the owners of the Sites, any user of the Sites,
              a third party or the general public. We also may disclose user
              information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit
              our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property;
              or protect the safety, rights, or property of others.
If you have concerns about the conduct of a particular user,
              please send an e-mail to
privacy@neopets.com
. This email is not to contact us about the status of your
              account.
B. Agents.
Information collected through the Sites may be transferred,
              disclosed or shared with third parties engaged by us to handle and
              deliver certain activities, such as message boards, sweepstakes
              and contests, e-cards, payment processing, newsletters, advisory
              boards, and to perform other technical and processing functions,
              such as sending postal mail and email, maintaining data integrity,
              programming operations, user services or technology services. We
              may provide these third parties with information collected as
              needed to perform their functions, but they are prohibited from
              using it for other purposes and specifically agree to maintain the
              confidentiality of such information. Some of these agents, such as
              payment processors, may request additional information during the
              course of offering their services. Before you provide additional
              information to third party agents, we encourage users to review
              their privacy policies and information collection practices.
C.

World of Neopia uses the services of third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit The Sites.

D.
Co-Branded Sites and Features.
Some Sites offer co-branded services and features, such as events
              and promotions that we put together with another company
              ("Co-Branded Partner"). Such services may be hosted on a Site
              and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your
              information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of
              or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you
              opt-in and affirmatively consent to both the Sites and our
              Co-Branded Partner collecting and using the information you
              provided during registration and/or in connection with the
              specific co-branded feature for fulfillment, marketing or
              administrative purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded
              Partner's future use of your information for marketing purposes,
              you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. The
              Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or
              service.
E.
World of Neopia and Other Affiliated Businesses.
The Sites are part of World of
              Neopia, Inc. Where permitted by law, we may share information we
              collect about you within the websites of World of Neopia'
              companies’ and other affiliated businesses so that we can, for
              example, provide you with information about products and services
              that might interest you.
F.
Business Transfer.
In the event that assets relating to one or more of the Sites are
              transferred or sold to another entity as a result of, for example,
              a corporate sale, merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the
              unlikely event of bankruptcy, information collected on the Sites
              may be transferred to the acquiring company.
G.
With Your Consent.
We may otherwise disclose your information pursuant to your
              consent.
III. INTERNATIONAL USERS
Please be aware that by providing us with personal information,
              (1) you understand and agree that your personal information may be
              stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction; (2)
              to the extent you are a resident of a country other than the
              United States, you consent to the storage of such data in the
              United States for processing by our affiliates in accordance with
              this Privacy Policy and (3) the Privacy Policy and the collection
              of information pursuant to the Privacy Policy shall be governed by
              and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States,
              without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.
You may also have specific privacy rights in the state or region
              you reside in, for example in the European Economic Area (EEA).
              You may access and view the specific disclosure for personal
              information in the EEA in Part IX.
If you do not consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please
              do not use the Sites because your use of the Sites represents your
              consent. If you have already provided personal information, please
              contact us about how you would like us to handle such information.
IV. SECURITY, STORAGE AND RETENTION OF
              INFORMATION
The Sites maintain reasonable technical and organizational steps
              to help ensure that information collected is secure, including
              limiting the number of people who have physical access to our
              database servers and use of electronic security systems and
              password protections which guard against unauthorized access. The
              Sites conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions. We
              limit access to user’s information to employees and contractors
              who are authorized for the proper handling of such information,
              and any employee found violating our standards of security and
              confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We
              also take reasonable steps to help make sure our third-party
              agents protect the security of your personal information. However,
              as with most internet sites or services, it is possible that third
              parties may unlawfully access such personal information through a
              number of means despite our efforts.  Information
              collected at the Sites will not be stored for longer than is
              necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or to
              otherwise meet legal requirements.
V. ACCESSING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION;
              TERMINATION OF WIRELESS SERVICES.
A. Reviewing Your Information.
You have the right to access, update
              and correct factual inaccuracies in personally identifiable
              information that we collect online at the Sites, subject to
              certain exceptions. To do so, you should log into your account or
              you may e-mail us at
privacy@neopets.com
. To help protect your privacy and the security of your
              personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable steps
              to verify your identity before granting access.
B. Parental Access.
Parents/guardians of children under the age of 13 can print out
              and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any
              personally identifiable information collected with their
              permission, about their child, have this information deleted,
              and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their
              child's personally identifiable information. To obtain the form,
              please e-mail us at
privacy@neopets.com
. We will take steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting
              personally identifiable information about a child and to ensure
              that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.
C. Termination of Wireless Services.
If you have registered for wireless
              services, you may cancel one or more wireless services via your
              wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism
              provided by the Sites at the time the message is sent, or by
              sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL",
              "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". The Sites will terminate your
              registration for the most recent wireless service you received.
              Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's
              termination request will cancel all of the user's registered
              wireless services with the Sites. If you unsubscribe from one or
              all of wireless service(s) via your wireless device, the
              service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel your
              previous opt-in.
VI. ONLINE SAFETY
Involvement in your family’s online lives is the most important
              safety tool available. We encourage you to use the following
              guidelines as starting point for discussing safety and privacy
              concerns with your child:
Never give out your personal information online.
Would you tell a stranger who you are and where you live?
                No way! Well chatting online is just like talking to strangers
                (except online, you can't even SEE them!) SO never give anyone
                your whole name, address or phone number on the internet, in
                email, in an instant message or in a chat room. If you know your
                Social Security Number or credit card or bank account number,
                definitely do not give those out either. And while you're at it,
                don't post anyone else's information, and be careful telling
                other people online the name of your school, sports team or
                favorite hang out. That information is yours and we want to keep
                it that way.
Don't use your real name in your screen name.
And while you're at it, don't include your age or your
                hometown either. You may think your screen name is super
                creative, but if it says too much about you, people you don't
                know can find out more about you then you think.
Keep your password to yourself.
Giving out
                your password is like giving your brother or sister the key to
                your room. Do you want them in there checking out all of your
                stuff whenever they feel like it? NO way! Same goes for your
                personal stuff online.
Read the rules and privacy options for websites that let you
                  connect with others online.
We mean really read 'em. Some sites only let certain
                people who have registered read posts, chat and look at other
                users' webpages. Others let anyone who comes to the site check
                out everything. No matter which kind of site you're on, find out
                if you can restrict your information so that it can only be seen
                by the people you choose.
Only share stuff online that you don't mind anyone seeing.
Anyone can use the internet and most people do. That
                includes your parents, your friends' parents, your teachers, and
                the creepy guy in the back of math class who never raises his
                hand. If you want private info to stay private, don't post it
                online.
Once you post something online, it stays online.
You can delete something you've typed or posted from a
                site, but people can get to older versions of that site where
                your info still exists. If you're not sure you should say
                something on the internet, you probably shouldn't.
Don't download anything if you don't know who it's from.
Downloads can give your computer viruses, mess up your
                applications and even cause your email server to send messages
                with your name on them to people you don't know. You can set the
                preferences on your computer to warn you about downloads before
                it opens them. So stop and think before you download anything
                you're not sure of. You don't know where that thing has been.
Keep your online friendships online.
There
                are all kinds of cool people using the internet. But there's no
                way of keeping the creeps out. If someone you met online wants
                to meet you in person, tell an adult. If you do end up meeting
                face to face bring a parent or another close adult with you.
And finally, if you feel unsafe, tell an adult.
If someone or something online is making you
                uncomfortable, tell a parent, a teacher or another adult you
                trust. Ask the adult to help you report the incident to the
                website, or if necessary to the police. Your actions might end
                up helping a lot of other people too.
VII. LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES
The websites that comprise the Sites may contain links to other
              sites, including those of sponsors, advertisers, social networking
              platforms, and survey companies. These other websites are governed
              by their own privacy policies or information collection practices,
              which may be substantially different from ours. We encourage users
              to other websites to review the privacy policies and information
              collection practices of those websites.
VIII. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and as amended, grants
              our users who are California residents to the following rights:
Right to Know:
You can request that us to
                disclose to you: (1) the categories and/or specific pieces of
                personal information they have collected about you, (2) the
                categories of sources for that personal information, (3) the
                purposes for which we use that information, (4) the categories
                of third parties with whom the business discloses the
                information, and (5) the categories of information that we sell
                or disclose to third parties. You can make a request to know up
                to twice a year, free of charge.
Right to Delete:
You can request us to
                delete personal information they collected from you and tell
                their service providers to do the same, subject to certain
                exceptions (such as if the business is legally required to keep
                the information).
Right to opt-out of sale or sharing
: You may
                request that we stop selling or sharing your personal
                information (“opt-out”), including via a user-enabled global
                privacy control. We cannot sell or share your personal
                information after they receive your opt-out request unless you
                later authorize them to do so again. You are also entitled to
                opt out from the sharing of personal information for purposes of
                cross-context behaviour advertising.
Right to correct
: You may ask us to correct
                inaccurate information that we have about you.
Right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal
                  information
: You can direct us to only use your sensitive personal
                information (for example, your social security number, financial
                account information, your precise geolocation data, or your
                genetic data) for limited purposes, such as providing you with
                the services you requested.
Right of Non-discrimination
: We offer fair
                treatment to all users who wish to exercise any of your
                rights.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our users who are
              California residents to request certain information regarding our
              disclosure of personal information to third parties for their
              direct marketing purposes. If at any time you wish to opt out of
              having your personal information shared with third parties and/or
              receiving information from us (via e-mail or postal mail) about
              new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may
              contact us at World of Neopia, Inc., Whitehall Chambers, 2nd Floor
              Whitehall House, 238 North Church Street, George Town, PO Box
              31489, KY1-1206, Cayman Islands. You can also contact us by
              e-mailing us at
privacy@neopets.com
. Please indicate what publications or services you no longer
              wish to receive so that we may better address your request.
This document is the sole statement of the Sites' Privacy Policy
              and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other
              privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without
              limitation, machine-generated, is valid. In interpreting this
              Agreement, the English version governs the interpretation and
              meaning of the obligation set forth herein. To the extent there is
              an ambiguity or conflict with the Privacy Policy in other
              languages, the Privacy Policy in English governs.
IX. GDPR (for European Economic Area
              Customers)
We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our
              enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for
              the management of the World of Neopia. The use of the internet
              pages of the World of Neopia is possible without any indication of
              personal data. However, if a data subject wants to use special
              enterprise services via our Sites, processing of personal data
              could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is
              necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we
              will obtain consent from the data subject.
The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
              address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in
              line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
              accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations
              applicable to the World of Neopia. By means of this data
              protection declaration, we would like to inform the general public
              of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect,
              use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means
              of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they
              are entitled.
As the controller, the World of Neopia has implemented numerous
              technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
              protection of personal data processed through the Sites. However,
              internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security
              gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this
              reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us
              via alternative means, e.g., by telephone.
A. Definitions
The data protection declaration of the World of Neopia is based on
              the terms used under the General Data Protection Regulation
              (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and
              understandable for the general public, as well as our customers
              and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first
              explain the terminology used.
In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the
              following terms:
Personal data
Personal data means any
                information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
                person . An identifiable natural person is one who can be
                identified, directly or indirectly (“data subject”), in
                particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
                identification number, location data, an online identifier or to
                one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
                genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
                natural person.
Data subject

                set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets
                of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as
                collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,
                adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
                transfer, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise
                making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure
                or destruction.
Restriction of processing
Restriction of
                processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim
                of limiting their processing in the future.
Profiling

                automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of
                personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a
                natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
                concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic
                situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability,
                behaviour, location, movements, or generally have a legal impact
                on the data subject.
Pseudonymisation
Pseudonymisation is the
                processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal
                data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject
                without the use of additional information, provided that such
                additional information is kept separately and is subject to
                technical and organisational measures to ensure that the
                personal data are not attributed to an identified or
                identifiable natural person.
Controller or controller responsible for the processing
Controller or controller responsible for the processing
                is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or
                other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
                purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the
                purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or
                Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for
                its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.

                person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the
                personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not.
                However, public authorities which may receive personal data in
                the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union
                or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the
                processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in
                compliance with the applicable data protection rules according
                to the purposes of the processing.
Third party
Third party is a natural or
                legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the

                direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised
                to process personal data.
Consent
Consent of the data subject is any
                voluntarily given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication
                of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement
                or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the

C. Cookies
The Internet pages of the World of Neopia uses cookies. Cookies
              are text files that are stored in a computer system via an
              internet browser.
Many internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain
              a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier for the
              cookie. It consists of a character string through which internet
              pages and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser
              in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited internet sites
              and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data
              subject from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
              specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using
              the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, the World of Neopia can provide the
              users of the Sites with more user-friendly services that would not
              be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our Sites can
              be optimized with the user in mind. The purpose of this
              recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our Sites.
              The website user that uses cookies, e.g., does not have to enter
              access data each time the website is accessed, because this is
              taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the
              user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a
              shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the
              articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart
              via a cookie.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
              through our Sites by means of a corresponding setting of the
              internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting
              of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any
              time via an internet browser or other software programs. This is
              possible in all internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates
              the setting of cookies in the internet browser used, not all
              functions of our website may be entirely available.
D. Collection of general data and information
The website of the World of Neopia collects a series of general
              data and information when a data subject or automated system calls
              up the website. This general data and information are stored in
              the server log files. The general data collected may be (1) the
              browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by
              the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing
              system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the
              sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Site, (6) an
              internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet service
              provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data
              and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our
              information technology systems.
When using these general data and information, the World of Neopia
              does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
              information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our Sites
              correctly, (2) optimize the content of our Sites as well as its
              advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our
              information technology systems and website technology, and (4)
              provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary
              for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the
              World of Neopia analyzes anonymously collected data and
              information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data
              protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an
              optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The
              anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from
              all personal data provided by a data subject.
E. Registration on our website
The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of
              the controller with the indication of personal data. Which
              personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by
              the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal
              data entered by the data subject are collected and stored
              exclusively for the purposes prescribed in Part I of the Privacy
              Policy by the controller. The controller may request transfer from
              the data subject to one or more processors (e.g., a parcel
              service) that also uses the data subject’s personal data for a
              purpose which is attributable the purpose or one of the lawful
              bases of processing.
By registering on the website of the controller, the IP
              address-assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used
              by the data subject-date, and time of the registration are also
              stored. The storage of this data takes place against the
              background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our
              services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate
              committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary
              to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third
              parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the
              data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary provision
              of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer
              the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to
              registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.
              Registered persons are free to correct the personal data specified
              during the registration at any time, or to have them completely
              deleted from the data stock of the controller.
F. Subscription to our newsletters
On the website of the World of Neopia, users are given the
              opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise's newsletter. The input
              mask used for this purpose determines what personal data is
              transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the
              controller.
The World of Neopia informs its customers and business partners
              regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. Our
              newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the
              data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject
              registers and consents for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation
              e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data
              subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal
              reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail
              is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the
              data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.
During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP
              address of the computer system assigned by the internet service
              provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the
              registration, as well as the date and time of the registration.
              The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand
              the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a
              later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal
              protection of the controller.
The personal data collected as part of a registration for the
              newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition,
              subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long
              as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service
              or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the
              event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of
              a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of
              personal data collected by the newsletter service to third
              parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by
              the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of
              personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the
              newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of
              revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each
              newsletter. Data subjects may unsubscribe from the newsletter at
              any time directly on the website of the controller, or to
              communicate this to the controller in a different way.
G. Newsletter-Tracking
The newsletter of the World of Neopia contains so-called tracking
              pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such
              e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file
              recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the
              success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the
              embedded tracking pixel, the World of Neopia may see if and when
              an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the
              e-mail were called up by data subjects.
Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in
              the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order
              to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt
              the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of
              the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to
              third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke
              the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of
              the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal
              data will be deleted by the controller. The World of Neopia
              automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the
              newsletter as a revocation.
H. Comments function in the blog on the website
The World of Neopia offers users the possibility to leave
              individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog,
              which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based,
              publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people
              called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down
              thoughts in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be
              commented on by third parties.
If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this
              website, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and
              published, as well as information on the date of the commentary
              and on the user's (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In
              addition, the IP address assigned by the internet service provider
              (ISP) to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP
              address takes place for security reasons, and in case the data
              subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal
              content through a given comment. The storage of these personal
              data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so
              that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This
              collected personal data will not be passed to third parties,
              unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the
              defense of the data controller.
I. Subscription to comments in the blog on the website
The comments made in the blog of the World of Neopia may be
              subscribed to by third parties. In particular, there is the
              possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following
              his comments on a particular blog post.
If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the
              controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail to check the
              double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified
              e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The option to
              subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time by the data
              subject.
J. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
The data controller shall process and store the personal data of
              the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the
              purpose of storage, or as far as this allowed under the GDPR.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period
              prescribed by GDPR expires, the personal data are routinely
              pseudonymized or erased in accordance with legal requirements.
K. Rights of the data subject
i) Right of confirmation
Each data subject
              shall have the right to obtain from the controller the
              confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or
              her are being stored and processed.
ii) Right of access
Each data subject shall
              have the right to obtain from the controller free information
              about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of
              this information. Furthermore, the European directives and
              regulations grant the data subject access to the following
              information:
the purposes of the processing;
the categories of personal data concerned;
the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the
                  personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular
                  recipients in third countries or international organisations;
where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal
                  data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to
                  determine that period;
the existence of the right to request from the controller
                  rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of
                  processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to
                  object to such processing;
the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a
                  supervisory authority;
where the personal data are not collected from the data
                  subject, any available information as to their source;
the existence of automated decision-making, including
                  profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR
                  and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the
                  logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged
                  consequences of such processing for the data subject.
Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain
              information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third
              party, or to an international organisation. Where this is the
              case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the
              appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.
iii) Right to rectification
Each data
              subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without
              undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data
              concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the
              processing, the data subject shall have the right to have
              incomplete personal data completed, including by means of
              providing a supplementary statement.
iv) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)
Each data subject shall have the right to obtain from the
              controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her
              without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation
              to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the
              following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not
              necessary:
Personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
                  purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is
                  based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or
                  point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no
                  other legal ground for the processing.
The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article
                  21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate
                  grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the
                  processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.
The personal data has been unlawfully processed.
The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal
                  obligation in Union or Member State law to which the
                  controller is subject.
The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer
                  of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of
                  the GDPR.
If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data
              subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by
              the controller, he or she may, at any time, contact any our Data
              Protection Officer. The Data Protection Officer shall promptly
              ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
Where the controller has made personal data public and is
              obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the
              controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of
              implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical
              measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data
              that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of
              any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as
              far as processing is not required. The Data Protection Officer
              will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.
v) Right of restriction of processing
Each
              data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller
              restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data
                  subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the
                  accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the
                  erasure of the personal data and requests instead the
                  restriction of their use instead.
The controller no longer needs the personal data for the
                  purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data
                  subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
                  claims.
The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to
                  Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the
                  legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the
                  data subject.
If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data
              subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of
              personal data stored by the World of Neopia, he or she may at any
              time contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection
              Officer will arrange the restriction of the processing.
vi) Right to data portability
Each data
              subject shall have the right to receive the personal data
              concerning him or her, which was provided to the controller, in a
              structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she
              shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller
              without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data
              have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent
              pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of
              Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b)
              of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by
              automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for
              the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in
              the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability
              pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have
              the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one
              controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing
              so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
In order to assert the right to data portability, the data
              subject may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer.
vii) Right to object
Each data subject shall
              have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her
              particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data
              concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of
              Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on
              these provisions.
The World of Neopia shall no longer process
              the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can
              demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which
              override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject,
              or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If the World of Neopia processes personal data for direct
              marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to
              object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him
              or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent
              that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject
              objects to the World of Neopia to the processing for direct
              marketing purposes, the World of Neopia will no longer process the
              personal data for these purposes.
In addition, the data
              subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her
              particular situation, to object to processing of personal data
              concerning him or her by the World of Neopia for scientific or
              historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant
              to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary
              for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
              interest.
In order to exercise the right to object, the data
              subject may contact any employee of the World of Neopia. In
              addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of
              information society services, and notwithstanding Directive
              2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means
              using technical specifications.
viii) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
Each data subject shall have the right not to be subject to
              a decision based solely on automated processing, including
              profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or
              similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the
              decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the
              performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data
              controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law
              to which the controller is subject and which also lays down
              suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and
              freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data
              subject's explicit consent.
If the decision (1) is necessary
              for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the
              data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data
              subject's explicit consent, the World of Neopia shall implement
              suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and
              freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain
              human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his
              or her point of view and contest the decision.
If the data
              subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated
              individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact
              any employee of the World of Neopia.
ix) Right to withdraw data protection consent
Each data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her
              consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.
If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the
              consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the
              World of Neopia.
The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon
              request to each data subject as to what personal data is stored
              about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall
              correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the
              data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage
              obligations. Please contact our Data Protection Officer to
              exercise any of the rights as set out in this policy.
L. Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of
                PayPal as a payment processor
On this website, the controller has integrated components of
              PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service provider. Payments are
              processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual
              private or business accounts. PayPal is also able to process
              virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a
              PayPal account. A PayPal account is managed via an e-mail address,
              which is why there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it
              possible to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive
              payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer
              protection services.
The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe)
              S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg,
              Luxembourg.
If the data subject chooses "PayPal" as the payment option in the
              online shop during the ordering process, we automatically transmit
              the data of the data subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment
              option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of personal data
              required for payment processing.
The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name,
              last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number,
              mobile phone number, credit or debit card number, expiry date of
              credit or debit card, or other data necessary for payment
              processing. The processing of the purchase contract also requires
              such personal data, which are in connection with the respective
              order.
The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and
              fraud prevention. The controller will transfer personal data to
              PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the
              transmission is given. The personal data exchanged between PayPal
              and the controller for the processing of the data will be
              transmitted by PayPal to economic credit agencies. This
              transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and
              service providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is
              necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be
              processed in the order.
The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the
              handling of personal data at any time from PayPal. A revocation
              shall not have any effect on personal data which must be
              processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual)
              payment processing.
The applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be
              retrieved under
              https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.
M. Legal basis for the processing
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing
              operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing
              purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
              performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as
              is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary
              for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the
              processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR.
The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary
              for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case
              of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company
              is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal
              data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations,
              the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to
              protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
              natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor
              were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance
              data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a
              doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would
              be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.
              f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which
              are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if
              processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
              interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where
              such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental
              rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection
              of personal data.
N. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual
                requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract;
                Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data;
                possible consequences of failure to provide such data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required
              by law (e.g., tax regulations) or can also result from contractual
              provisions (e.g., information on the contractual partner).
              Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data
              subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be
              processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to
              provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract
              with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have
              the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not
              be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data
              subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee
              clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the
              personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for
              the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to
              provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of
              the personal data.
O. Existence of automated decision-making
As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making
              or profiling.
P. International Transfers
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure
              a similar degree of protection is afford to your personal
              information by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards
              is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
                been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for
                personal data.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
                contracts that are in compliance with the GDPR which give
                personal data the same protection it has in the EEA.

              protected.
Our users’ privacy is important to us, and
              we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protection for

              parents or guardians before entering information on any website or
              mobile application and we encourage families to discuss their
              household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal
              information. In order for a child to fully participate on any of
              the Sites, no personally identifiable information is collected
              from a child until such time as verifiable parental or guardian
              consent is received from the child’s parent or guardian. In order
              to register on our site as a user, the child’s parent or guardian
              must activate their account. Users may choose to play as Guests
              without the collection of information, recording of game play,
              prizes or gems when users return.

What We Share:
Depending upon the circumstances and to the extent as
                      permitted by the applicable laws of California, we may
                      share collected information with:
Law enforcement or others as needed to protect or defend
                        our rights and the rights of others;
Third parties we hire to handle certain activities;
Advertisers or third parties with whom we may partner to
                        provide you additional content, products or services;
Business partners who sponsor a sweepstakes or contest
                        or who jointly offer a service or feature on the Sites;
Within the World of Neopia family of companies;
In the event of a corporate transaction; and
Otherwise with your consent.
We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use
                      your personal information for any other purpose, and that
                      they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security
                      and integrity of the personal information they obtain from
                      us.
Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of
                      third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we
                      cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy
                      and security procedures as World of Neopia.
Our sites may also have message boards and/or chat areas,
                      where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one
                      another. When posting to a message board or chat area,
                      please be aware that the information is being made
                      publicly available online and the user does so at his or
                      her own risk.
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
: We do not “sell” your personal information that
                      directly identifies you. However, the CCPA’s broad
                      definitions of “sale” and “personal information” may deem
                      the common flow of information in the digital analytics
                      and advertising ecosystem to be a sale. We use online
                      analytics to measure the ways users engage with our
                      websites and apps. These analytics, in turn, inform how we
                      perform online advertising. In order to provide these
                      analytics and facilitate online advertising, we use
                      third-parties that collect device identifiers and place
                      tags, cookies, beacons, and similar tracking mechanisms on
                      our Sites.
To the extent that we sell your personal information, you
                      may have the right to direct us to stop selling your
                      personal information if we do so. Please contact us if you
                      wish to exercise this right.

Who Else Is Collecting
                    Information:
We may use a number of advertising networks, analytics
                      service providers and other such companies to, for
                      example, serve advertisements or analyze the performance
                      of the Sites. These companies may use their own unique
                      identifiers, and their use of these technologies is within
                      their control and not ours. These companies may use the
                      information they collect from you consistent with their
                      own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
For more information about these third parties and how you
                      might be able to control how they use your information,

Who We Are:
These Sites are made available by World of Neopia, Inc.,

I. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.
We may request or collect certain information when you visit the
              Sites. However, users are required to share only the information
              that is reasonably necessary to participate in the particular
              activity.
A. Registration Information:
The information required to register varies by Site, but may
              include: (a) birth date; (b) gender; (c) country; (d) state; (e)
              zip code; (f) user name and password; (g) wireless telephone
              number; (h) email address; and (i) other profile information such
              as avatar preferences, communications preferences, and interests.
              Children under the age of thirteen (13) may be asked to provide
              his or her parent's or guardian's email address. Users or their
              parents/guardians will receive an activation email and must follow
              the procedures or otherwise agree to the terms within the
              activation email within a certain time period to activate the
              account. Accounts not activated within that time period will be
              deleted. Included in the activation email is a verifiable parental
              or guardian consent form that may be completed by a child’s parent
              or guardian permitting the collection of certain personally
              identifiable information or allowing the child to enter certain
              free entry text on the Sites.
Registration information is used to enable users to take advantage
              of site offerings; respond to user’s requests for products,
              services, and information; manage games; serve appropriate
              material; customize the content you see when you visit the Sites;
              and offer users special offers and promotions from the Sites and
              World of Neopia' companies and its subsidiaries and affiliates as
              well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products,
              programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.
B. Computer Information Collected by
                Us:
When users come to a Site, we may automatically collect certain
              information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the
              type of computer operating system, the user's IP address, the web
              browser, UDID (for certain mobile devices), information about the
              websites visited before and after visiting the Site, the web pages
              and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Sites,
              interactions with e-mail messages sent by a Site or World of
              Neopia' companies (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages
              were opened or forwarded), information collected through the use
              of unique identifiers such as cookies (see below), information
              regarding the internet service provider, and other standard server
              log information ("Computer Information").
We may use cookies, web beacons, tokens or similar technologies
              (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) on the
              Sites. "Cookies" are text files that help store user preferences
              and activity. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web
              bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data,
              such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising
              responses. “Tokens” are unique persistent identifiers that are
              generated and sent from a server to a user’s device to identify an
              interaction session, such as the authentication for a user’s cable
              provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie.
              The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to
              collect Computer Information automatically as you browse the Site
              and the web.
We may use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow
              users to move between certain Sites without logging into each
              Site, enable the internal functioning of the Sites, understand
              Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content,
              offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your
              experience on the Site (for example, to recognize you by name when
              you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email
              messages originating from the Sites or World of Neopia' companies
              (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened
              or forwarded), save your password, save your online game or video
              player settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer
              you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you,
              deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Sites.
              These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and
              additional other information regarding your visits to the Sites
              (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features,
              purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other
              information across multiple sessions on the Sites and other
              websites offered by World of Neopia' companies and may also
              collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the
              device you use to access the Site (“Identifier”). An Identifier
              may be automatically assigned to any device you use to access the
              Sites.
By visiting a Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you
              acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us
              your consent to set and access Cookies on your device and track
              your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking
              Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use in the emails we
              send to you.
While none of our Sites track our users for behavioral advertising
              purposes we feel it is important for our users to be aware of
              their choices when it comes to their online privacy. Click
here
for more information about online behavioral advertising.
              World of Neopia does not use any behaviorally target advertising
              on our sites.
Our Third Party Advertising Service Providers (as defined in
              Section C) do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the
              Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the
              Site. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as
              advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking
              Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking
              Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if
              you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access
              to other information about you.
You have a number of options with respect to the Tracking
              Technologies set by the Sites.  You may be able to have
              the device you use to access the Sites warn you each time a cookie
              or other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash
              cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings. This is
              done through your browser on the device you use to access the
              Sites. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings
              may be available through your browser’s support feature.
Please be aware that certain areas and features of the Sites can
              only be accessed in conjunction with Tracking Technologies, and
              that disabling Tracking Technologies might prevent you from
              accessing such content.
C. Computer Information Collected By
                Others:
The Sites may use the services of
              third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information,
              IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of
              users who visit the Sites.
The Sites use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data
              exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing
              analytics service providers, and other third-party service
              providers (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service
              Providers”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Sites,
              facilitate targeting of advertisements, or measure and analyze
              advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Sites (“Targeting
              Services”) in an aggregate and anonymous form.
These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access
              to Tracking Technologies set by the Sites except to the extent
              necessary to provide services to the Sites. The Third Party
              Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may
              themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your
              device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your
              browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them)
              and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about
              you. In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may
              collect aggregate log data separately and independently from what
              the Sites collect.
You should be aware that different rules might apply to the
              collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties
              in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other
              websites you encounter on the internet. The use of such technology
              by these third parties is within their control and not the Sites.
              Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not
              control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your
              information and those sites may use the information they collect
              from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we
              encourage you to review. We are not responsible for any action or
              omission by the third parties in relation to the collection, use
              or disclosure of cookie information, IP addresses, identifiers or
              other personal information collected by the third party. We
              encourage you to research and direct any of your questions in this
              regard to these third parties.
Some of these Providers and Advertisers may participate in the
              Network
Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool
and/or the
Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising
. Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about
              your choices.
Please note the following with respect to opting out of Tracking
              Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and
              advertisers:
The opt-out tools discussed above are “cookie based.”
This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your
                choices with respect to the use of your information by the
                parties that offer you those choices. If you opt-out but then
                use the controls in your browser to delete all Tracking
                Technologies, you may have to opt-out again, a second time, in
                order to re-establish your opt-out preferences.
Opt-outs are browser-specific.
This means,
                for example, that if you opt out while using a particular
                internet browser, this choice will not affect the collection of
                information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use
                another internet browser on the same device. It also means that
                opting out on one device will not affect the collection of
                information by Tracking Technologies on other devices you may
                use to access the Sites.
Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off
                Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies
                does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.
                Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off
                Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies
                only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your
                specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to
                see ads on the Sites.
Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may
              transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the
              browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers
              incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear
              whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or
              whether they even are aware of them. There currently is
              disagreement, including among participants in the leading internet
              standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything,
              websites should do when they receive such signals.
We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but,
              if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may
              reassess how to respond to these signals.
D. Contests and Sweepstakes:
The Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes. To enter
              these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide
              your first name and email address and/or additional information
              required for the management of the contest or sweepstakes. For
              children under the age of 13, we may collect the child’s e-mail
              address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store
              such child’s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes,
              and use it for notification if he or she is the
              winner following the child’s parent or guardian’s consent.
              For contests or sweepstakes on such sites, we may ask for the
              email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the
              parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent
              or guardian the option to have the child's entry deleted.
E. Electronic Postcards and Messages:
The Sites may provide users the
              opportunity to send electronic postcards and “wish lists” of items
              they want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the
              user’s behalf, email messages to family and/or friends. To do so,
              users must provide the email address of the recipient of such
              electronic postcards or email messages. Users must only provide
              email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive
              such electronic postcards or email messages. Email addresses
              provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the
              requested postcard or email message and are anonymized and deleted
              from our system once the postcard or message is sent. In some
              cases, we may offer users an incentive (e.g., points to be used in
              an online game) for referring information about products to the
              user's family or friends. In such cases, we will comply with all
              applicable legal requirements. Please note that this feature may
              not be available to users in certain regions or countries.
F. Electronic Newsletters:
Users can provide their email
              addresses to receive email newsletters and promotions from World
              of Neopia' companies, and our business partners. Users may change
              their preferences regarding emails at any time through the
              unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for certain Sites, by
              logging into and changing the preferences for their account.
G. Interactive Features and Services:
Some of the Sites may offer
              interactive features and services, such as message boards, chat
              rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes, messaging
              services, and member profile pages. For a user who is a child
              under the age of 13 years, we either will obtain parental consent
              before allowing the child to use these interactive features and
              services or will use reasonable technical measures to anonymize
              and delete all personal information from a child’s postings before
              they are made public and also anonymize and delete such
              information from our records. We use the information collected
              through interactive features and services to enable you to
              participate in such features and services.
H. Wireless Marketing Services:
Consistent with local law, appropriately aged users may have the
              opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news,
              programming and information delivered via text messaging and/or
              wireless devices. To do so, users may be asked to provide their
              telephone number, email address, carrier’s name, and/or their
              opinion regarding certain goods and/or services. Users must opt in
              to receive wireless marketing material from businesses within
              World of Neopia companies through one of the following methods:
              (a) filling out the registration information on any The Sites’
              wireless marketing registration page; or (b) sending a specific
              word, code or symbol via a text message to a telephone number
              designated by us in any promotional material. The user may also be
              asked to confirm his or her acceptance to receive such wireless
              marketing services.
Users that register for wireless marketing services acknowledge,
              understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's
              wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from the Sites
              or World of Neopia' companies. Standard messaging rates will
              apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will World
              of Neopia' companies be responsible for any wireless email or text
              messaging charges incurred by such user or by a person that has
              access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email
              address.
I.
Geolocation
Information:
We may collect and store
              information about your geographic location, but we will only
              collect precise geolocation information sufficient to
              identify street name and name of a city or town on the Sites that
              either are directed to users over the age of 13 and only
              if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location
              information. You may be able to change the settings on your
              computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with
              such information. We use this information, for example, to enable
              users to take advantage of Site offerings; respond to user’s
              requests for products, services, and information; manage games;
              customize the content users see when visiting the Sites; and to
              offer users special offers and promotions from The Sites and World
              of Neopia' companies, as well as on behalf of selected third
              parties offering products, programs or services that we believe
              may be of interest to our users. By accepting this Privacy Policy
              and using the applicable Site, you hereby consent to the
              collection and storage of such geolocation information as
              described above. You have the right to limit our use and
              disclosure of your precise geolocation information to certain
              enumerated business purposes under the laws of California. To make
              a request, please send an e-mail to
privacy@neopets.com
.
J. Financial Information:
We collect and use financial information, such as credit card
              numbers and security codes, for the limited purposes described
              below.
Consumer Products
: Certain Sites provide pages
                and/or links to pages offering users who are of legal age to
                form a binding contract the opportunity to purchase consumer
                products (the "Shops"). To do so, users need to provide contact,
                shipping, billing and credit information. These pages may be
                hosted and operated by a third party that is independent and
                separate from the Sites. The third party collects personal
                information about shop users and may share this information with
                us. We use this information to process the order and to send
                order confirmations via email, as well as to send information
                about products and services of interest and as otherwise
                required by law. Before providing information on these pages, we
                encourage you to review the posted privacy policies which govern
                such third party’s use of your information, as they may differ
                from ours.
Virtual Items/Memberships
: Some of the Sites
                may offer memberships, online subscriptions and/or virtual items
                for use in conjunction with the Sites' games. When you enter
                into a transaction for a membership, subscription, virtual item
                or similar transaction, you may be asked to provide the credit
                card and/or billing information and email address. We will use
                this information to fulfill your specified requests, as well as
                to inform you about additional products or service opportunities
                and as otherwise required by law.  Please also see the
                information regarding payment processors in Section II(B) below.
K. Other Data Collection and Use.
We collect search query information when users search for
              information on the Sites. We also collect information from users
              when they contact us with questions and comments.
We may use this information, along with any of the other
              information described above, to (i) analyze use of the Sites and
              understand and improve our service offerings; (ii) prevent
              potentially prohibited or illegal activities; and (iii) for any
              other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your
              information or pursuant to your consent.
We may combine information collected through the Sites with
              information we collect from other sources (e.g., social media
              integration services), other World of Neopia' company’s sites,
              offline records or publicly available information). It is your
              responsibility to provide complete and accurate information and to
              keep such information up to date. We are not responsible for any
              problem or liability arising from your failure to do so.
II. DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES
We may share your information with third parties for the limited
              purposes described below. In the U.S., parents and guardians of
              children under the age of 13 have the option of consenting to the
              collection and use of their child's personal information without
              consenting to the disclosure of that information to certain third
              parties.
A. Law Enforcement and Safety.
You acknowledge, consent, and agree
              to the extent legally permissible in your jurisdiction to allow us
              to access, preserve, and/or disclose the information we collect
              and/or content you provide to us (including information you may
              have posted on bulletin boards or internal site communication
              systems) to a law enforcement agency or other third parties if
              required to do so by law or with a good faith belief that such
              access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
              (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms of Use of the
              respective The Sites; (c) respond to claims that the content
              violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests
              for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or
              personal safety of the owners of the Sites, any user of the Sites,
              a third party or the general public. We also may disclose user
              information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit
              our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property;
              or protect the safety, rights, or property of others.
If you have concerns about the conduct of a particular user,
              please send an e-mail to

              account.
B. Agents.
Information collected through the Sites may be transferred,
              disclosed or shared with third parties engaged by us to handle and
              deliver certain activities, such as message boards, sweepstakes
              and contests, e-cards, payment processing, newsletters, advisory
              boards, and to perform other technical and processing functions,
              such as sending postal mail and email, maintaining data integrity,
              programming operations, user services or technology services. We
              may provide these third parties with information collected as
              needed to perform their functions, but they are prohibited from
              using it for other purposes and specifically agree to maintain the
              confidentiality of such information. Some of these agents, such as
              payment processors, may request additional information during the
              course of offering their services. Before you provide additional
              information to third party agents, we encourage users to review
              their privacy policies and information collection practices.

Co-Branded Sites and Features.
Some Sites offer co-branded services and features, such as events
              and promotions that we put together with another company
              ("Co-Branded Partner"). Such services may be hosted on a Site
              and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your
              information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of
              or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you
              opt-in and affirmatively consent to both the Sites and our
              Co-Branded Partner collecting and using the information you
              provided during registration and/or in connection with the
              specific co-branded feature for fulfillment, marketing or
              administrative purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded
              Partner's future use of your information for marketing purposes,
              you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. The
              Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or
              service.
E.
World of Neopia and Other Affiliated Businesses.
The Sites are part of World of
              Neopia, Inc. Where permitted by law, we may share information we
              collect about you within the websites of World of Neopia'
              companies’ and other affiliated businesses so that we can, for
              example, provide you with information about products and services
              that might interest you.
F.
Business Transfer.
In the event that assets relating to one or more of the Sites are
              transferred or sold to another entity as a result of, for example,
              a corporate sale, merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the
              unlikely event of bankruptcy, information collected on the Sites
              may be transferred to the acquiring company.
G.
With Your Consent.
We may otherwise disclose your information pursuant to your
              consent.
III. INTERNATIONAL USERS
Please be aware that by providing us with personal information,
              (1) you understand and agree that your personal information may be
              stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction; (2)
              to the extent you are a resident of a country other than the
              United States, you consent to the storage of such data in the
              United States for processing by our affiliates in accordance with
              this Privacy Policy and (3) the Privacy Policy and the collection
              of information pursuant to the Privacy Policy shall be governed by
              and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States,
              without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.
You may also have specific privacy rights in the state or region
              you reside in, for example in the European Economic Area (EEA).
              You may access and view the specific disclosure for personal
              information in the EEA in Part IX.
If you do not consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please
              do not use the Sites because your use of the Sites represents your
              consent. If you have already provided personal information, please
              contact us about how you would like us to handle such information.
IV. SECURITY, STORAGE AND RETENTION OF
              INFORMATION
The Sites maintain reasonable technical and organizational steps
              to help ensure that information collected is secure, including
              limiting the number of people who have physical access to our
              database servers and use of electronic security systems and
              password protections which guard against unauthorized access. The
              Sites conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions. We
              limit access to user’s information to employees and contractors
              who are authorized for the proper handling of such information,
              and any employee found violating our standards of security and
              confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We
              also take reasonable steps to help make sure our third-party
              agents protect the security of your personal information. However,
              as with most internet sites or services, it is possible that third
              parties may unlawfully access such personal information through a
              number of means despite our efforts.  Information
              collected at the Sites will not be stored for longer than is
              necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or to
              otherwise meet legal requirements.
V. ACCESSING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION;
              TERMINATION OF WIRELESS SERVICES.
A. Reviewing Your Information.
You have the right to access, update
              and correct factual inaccuracies in personally identifiable
              information that we collect online at the Sites, subject to
              certain exceptions. To do so, you should log into your account or
              you may e-mail us at
privacy@neopets.com
. To help protect your privacy and the security of your
              personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable steps
              to verify your identity before granting access.
B. Parental Access.
Parents/guardians of children under the age of 13 can print out
              and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any
              personally identifiable information collected with their
              permission, about their child, have this information deleted,
              and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their
              child's personally identifiable information. To obtain the form,
              please e-mail us at
privacy@neopets.com
. We will take steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting
              personally identifiable information about a child and to ensure
              that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.
C. Termination of Wireless Services.
If you have registered for wireless
              services, you may cancel one or more wireless services via your
              wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism
              provided by the Sites at the time the message is sent, or by
              sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL",
              "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". The Sites will terminate your
              registration for the most recent wireless service you received.
              Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's
              termination request will cancel all of the user's registered
              wireless services with the Sites. If you unsubscribe from one or
              all of wireless service(s) via your wireless device, the
              service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel your
              previous opt-in.
VI. ONLINE SAFETY
Involvement in your family’s online lives is the most important
              safety tool available. We encourage you to use the following
              guidelines as starting point for discussing safety and privacy
              concerns with your child:
Never give out your personal information online.
Would you tell a stranger who you are and where you live?
                No way! Well chatting online is just like talking to strangers
                (except online, you can't even SEE them!) SO never give anyone
                your whole name, address or phone number on the internet, in
                email, in an instant message or in a chat room. If you know your
                Social Security Number or credit card or bank account number,
                definitely do not give those out either. And while you're at it,
                don't post anyone else's information, and be careful telling
                other people online the name of your school, sports team or
                favorite hang out. That information is yours and we want to keep
                it that way.
Don't use your real name in your screen name.
And while you're at it, don't include your age or your
                hometown either. You may think your screen name is super
                creative, but if it says too much about you, people you don't
                know can find out more about you then you think.
Keep your password to yourself.
Giving out
                your password is like giving your brother or sister the key to
                your room. Do you want them in there checking out all of your
                stuff whenever they feel like it? NO way! Same goes for your
                personal stuff online.
Read the rules and privacy options for websites that let you
                  connect with others online.
We mean really read 'em. Some sites only let certain
                people who have registered read posts, chat and look at other
                users' webpages. Others let anyone who comes to the site check
                out everything. No matter which kind of site you're on, find out
                if you can restrict your information so that it can only be seen
                by the people you choose.
Only share stuff online that you don't mind anyone seeing.
Anyone can use the internet and most people do. That
                includes your parents, your friends' parents, your teachers, and
                the creepy guy in the back of math class who never raises his
                hand. If you want private info to stay private, don't post it
                online.
Once you post something online, it stays online.
You can delete something you've typed or posted from a
                site, but people can get to older versions of that site where
                your info still exists. If you're not sure you should say
                something on the internet, you probably shouldn't.
Don't download anything if you don't know who it's from.
Downloads can give your computer viruses, mess up your
                applications and even cause your email server to send messages
                with your name on them to people you don't know. You can set the
                preferences on your computer to warn you about downloads before
                it opens them. So stop and think before you download anything
                you're not sure of. You don't know where that thing has been.
Keep your online friendships online.
There
                are all kinds of cool people using the internet. But there's no
                way of keeping the creeps out. If someone you met online wants
                to meet you in person, tell an adult. If you do end up meeting
                face to face bring a parent or another close adult with you.
And finally, if you feel unsafe, tell an adult.
If someone or something online is making you
                uncomfortable, tell a parent, a teacher or another adult you
                trust. Ask the adult to help you report the incident to the
                website, or if necessary to the police. Your actions might end
                up helping a lot of other people too.
VII. LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES
The websites that comprise the Sites may contain links to other
              sites, including those of sponsors, advertisers, social networking
              platforms, and survey companies. These other websites are governed
              by their own privacy policies or information collection practices,
              which may be substantially different from ours. We encourage users
              to other websites to review the privacy policies and information
              collection practices of those websites.
VIII. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and as amended, grants
              our users who are California residents to the following rights:
Right to Know:
You can request that us to
                disclose to you: (1) the categories and/or specific pieces of
                personal information they have collected about you, (2) the
                categories of sources for that personal information, (3) the
                purposes for which we use that information, (4) the categories
                of third parties with whom the business discloses the
                information, and (5) the categories of information that we sell
                or disclose to third parties. You can make a request to know up
                to twice a year, free of charge.
Right to Delete:
You can request us to
                delete personal information they collected from you and tell
                their service providers to do the same, subject to certain
                exceptions (such as if the business is legally required to keep
                the information).
Right to opt-out of sale or sharing
: You may
                request that we stop selling or sharing your personal
                information (“opt-out”), including via a user-enabled global
                privacy control. We cannot sell or share your personal
                information after they receive your opt-out request unless you
                later authorize them to do so again. You are also entitled to
                opt out from the sharing of personal information for purposes of
                cross-context behaviour advertising.
Right to correct
: You may ask us to correct
                inaccurate information that we have about you.
Right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal
                  information
: You can direct us to only use your sensitive personal
                information (for example, your social security number, financial
                account information, your precise geolocation data, or your
                genetic data) for limited purposes, such as providing you with
                the services you requested.
Right of Non-discrimination
: We offer fair
                treatment to all users who wish to exercise any of your
                rights.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our users who are
              California residents to request certain information regarding our
              disclosure of personal information to third parties for their
              direct marketing purposes. If at any time you wish to opt out of
              having your personal information shared with third parties and/or
              receiving information from us (via e-mail or postal mail) about
              new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may
              contact us at World of Neopia, Inc., Whitehall Chambers, 2nd Floor
              Whitehall House, 238 North Church Street, George Town, PO Box
              31489, KY1-1206, Cayman Islands. You can also contact us by
              e-mailing us at
privacy@neopets.com
. Please indicate what publications or services you no longer
              wish to receive so that we may better address your request.
This document is the sole statement of the Sites' Privacy Policy
              and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other
              privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without
              limitation, machine-generated, is valid. In interpreting this
              Agreement, the English version governs the interpretation and
              meaning of the obligation set forth herein. To the extent there is
              an ambiguity or conflict with the Privacy Policy in other
              languages, the Privacy Policy in English governs.
IX. GDPR (for European Economic Area
              Customers)
We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our
              enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for
              the management of the World of Neopia. The use of the internet
              pages of the World of Neopia is possible without any indication of
              personal data. However, if a data subject wants to use special
              enterprise services via our Sites, processing of personal data
              could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is
              necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we
              will obtain consent from the data subject.
The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
              address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in
              line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
              accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations
              applicable to the World of Neopia. By means of this data
              protection declaration, we would like to inform the general public
              of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect,
              use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means
              of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they
              are entitled.
As the controller, the World of Neopia has implemented numerous
              technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
              protection of personal data processed through the Sites. However,
              internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security
              gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this
              reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us
              via alternative means, e.g., by telephone.
A. Definitions
The data protection declaration of the World of Neopia is based on
              the terms used under the General Data Protection Regulation
              (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and
              understandable for the general public, as well as our customers
              and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first
              explain the terminology used.
In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the
              following terms:
Personal data
Personal data means any
                information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
                person . An identifiable natural person is one who can be
                identified, directly or indirectly (“data subject”), in
                particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
                identification number, location data, an online identifier or to
                one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
                genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
                natural person.

Processing is any operation or
                set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets
                of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as
                collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,
                adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
                transfer, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise
                making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure
                or destruction.

                of limiting their processing in the future.
Profiling
Profiling means any form of
                automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of
                personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a
                natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
                concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic
                situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability,
                behaviour, location, movements, or generally have a legal impact
                on the data subject.
Pseudonymisation
Pseudonymisation is the
                processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal
                data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject
                without the use of additional information, provided that such
                additional information is kept separately and is subject to
                technical and organisational measures to ensure that the
                personal data are not attributed to an identified or
                identifiable natural person.
Controller or controller responsible for the processing
Controller or controller responsible for the processing
                is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or
                other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
                purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the
                purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or
                Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for
                its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
Processor

                person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the
                personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not.
                However, public authorities which may receive personal data in
                the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union
                or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the
                processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in
                compliance with the applicable data protection rules according
                to the purposes of the processing.
Third party
Third party is a natural or
                legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the
                data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the
                direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised
                to process personal data.
Consent
Consent of the data subject is any
                voluntarily given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication
                of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement
                or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the

C. Cookies
The Internet pages of the World of Neopia uses cookies. Cookies
              are text files that are stored in a computer system via an
              internet browser.
Many internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain
              a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier for the
              cookie. It consists of a character string through which internet
              pages and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser
              in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited internet sites
              and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data
              subject from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
              specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using
              the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, the World of Neopia can provide the
              users of the Sites with more user-friendly services that would not
              be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our Sites can
              be optimized with the user in mind. The purpose of this
              recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our Sites.
              The website user that uses cookies, e.g., does not have to enter
              access data each time the website is accessed, because this is
              taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the
              user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a
              shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the
              articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart
              via a cookie.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
              through our Sites by means of a corresponding setting of the
              internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting
              of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any
              time via an internet browser or other software programs. This is
              possible in all internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates
              the setting of cookies in the internet browser used, not all
              functions of our website may be entirely available.
D. Collection of general data and information
The website of the World of Neopia collects a series of general
              data and information when a data subject or automated system calls
              up the website. This general data and information are stored in
              the server log files. The general data collected may be (1) the
              browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by
              the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing
              system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the
              sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Site, (6) an
              internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet service
              provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data
              and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our
              information technology systems.
When using these general data and information, the World of Neopia
              does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
              information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our Sites
              correctly, (2) optimize the content of our Sites as well as its
              advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our
              information technology systems and website technology, and (4)
              provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary
              for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the
              World of Neopia analyzes anonymously collected data and
              information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data
              protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an
              optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The
              anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from
              all personal data provided by a data subject.
E. Registration on our website
The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of
              the controller with the indication of personal data. Which
              personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by
              the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal
              data entered by the data subject are collected and stored
              exclusively for the purposes prescribed in Part I of the Privacy
              Policy by the controller. The controller may request transfer from
              the data subject to one or more processors (e.g., a parcel
              service) that also uses the data subject’s personal data for a
              purpose which is attributable the purpose or one of the lawful
              bases of processing.
By registering on the website of the controller, the IP
              address-assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used
              by the data subject-date, and time of the registration are also
              stored. The storage of this data takes place against the
              background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our
              services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate
              committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary
              to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third
              parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the
              data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary provision
              of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer
              the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to
              registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.
              Registered persons are free to correct the personal data specified
              during the registration at any time, or to have them completely
              deleted from the data stock of the controller.
F. Subscription to our newsletters
On the website of the World of Neopia, users are given the
              opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise's newsletter. The input
              mask used for this purpose determines what personal data is
              transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the
              controller.
The World of Neopia informs its customers and business partners
              regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. Our
              newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the
              data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject
              registers and consents for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation
              e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data
              subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal
              reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail
              is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the
              data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.
During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP
              address of the computer system assigned by the internet service
              provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the
              registration, as well as the date and time of the registration.
              The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand
              the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a
              later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal
              protection of the controller.
The personal data collected as part of a registration for the
              newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition,
              subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long
              as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service
              or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the
              event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of
              a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of
              personal data collected by the newsletter service to third
              parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by
              the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of
              personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the
              newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of
              revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each
              newsletter. Data subjects may unsubscribe from the newsletter at
              any time directly on the website of the controller, or to
              communicate this to the controller in a different way.
G. Newsletter-Tracking
The newsletter of the World of Neopia contains so-called tracking
              pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such
              e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file
              recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the
              success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the
              embedded tracking pixel, the World of Neopia may see if and when
              an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the
              e-mail were called up by data subjects.
Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in
              the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order
              to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt
              the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of
              the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to
              third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke
              the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of
              the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal
              data will be deleted by the controller. The World of Neopia
              automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the
              newsletter as a revocation.
H. Comments function in the blog on the website
The World of Neopia offers users the possibility to leave
              individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog,
              which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based,
              publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people
              called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down
              thoughts in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be
              commented on by third parties.
If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this
              website, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and
              published, as well as information on the date of the commentary
              and on the user's (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In
              addition, the IP address assigned by the internet service provider
              (ISP) to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP
              address takes place for security reasons, and in case the data
              subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal
              content through a given comment. The storage of these personal
              data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so
              that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This
              collected personal data will not be passed to third parties,
              unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the
              defense of the data controller.
I. Subscription to comments in the blog on the website
The comments made in the blog of the World of Neopia may be
              subscribed to by third parties. In particular, there is the
              possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following
              his comments on a particular blog post.
If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the
              controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail to check the
              double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified
              e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The option to
              subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time by the data
              subject.
J. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
The data controller shall process and store the personal data of
              the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the
              purpose of storage, or as far as this allowed under the GDPR.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period
              prescribed by GDPR expires, the personal data are routinely
              pseudonymized or erased in accordance with legal requirements.
K. Rights of the data subject
i) Right of confirmation
Each data subject
              shall have the right to obtain from the controller the

              following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not
              necessary:
Personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
                  purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is
                  based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or
                  point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no
                  other legal ground for the processing.
The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article
                  21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate
                  grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the

The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal
                  obligation in Union or Member State law to which the
                  controller is subject.
The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer
                  of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of
                  the GDPR.
If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data
              subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by
              the controller, he or she may, at any time, contact any our Data
              Protection Officer. The Data Protection Officer shall promptly
              ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
Where the controller has made personal data public and is
              obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the
              controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of
              implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical
              measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data
              that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of
              any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as
              far as processing is not required. The Data Protection Officer
              will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.
v) Right of restriction of processing
Each
              data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller
              restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data
                  subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the
                  accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the
                  erasure of the personal data and requests instead the
                  restriction of their use instead.
The controller no longer needs the personal data for the
                  purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data
                  subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
                  claims.
The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to
                  Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the
                  legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the
                  data subject.
If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data
              subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of
              personal data stored by the World of Neopia, he or she may at any
              time contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection
              Officer will arrange the restriction of the processing.
vi) Right to data portability
Each data
              subject shall have the right to receive the personal data
              concerning him or her, which was provided to the controller, in a
              structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she
              shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller
              without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data
              have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent
              pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of
              Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b)
              of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by
              automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for
              the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in
              the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability
              pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have
              the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one
              controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing
              so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
In order to assert the right to data portability, the data
              subject may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer.
vii) Right to object
Each data subject shall
              have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her
              particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data
              concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of
              Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on
              these provisions.
The World of Neopia shall no longer process
              the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can
              demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which
              override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject,
              or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If the World of Neopia processes personal data for direct
              marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to
              object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him
              or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent
              that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject
              objects to the World of Neopia to the processing for direct
              marketing purposes, the World of Neopia will no longer process the
              personal data for these purposes.
In addition, the data
              subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her
              particular situation, to object to processing of personal data
              concerning him or her by the World of Neopia for scientific or
              historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant
              to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary
              for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
              interest.
In order to exercise the right to object, the data
              subject may contact any employee of the World of Neopia. In
              addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of
              information society services, and notwithstanding Directive
              2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means
              using technical specifications.
viii) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
Each data subject shall have the right not to be subject to
              a decision based solely on automated processing, including
              profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or
              similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the
              decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the
              performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data
              controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law
              to which the controller is subject and which also lays down
              suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and
              freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data
              subject's explicit consent.
If the decision (1) is necessary
              for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the
              data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data
              subject's explicit consent, the World of Neopia shall implement
              suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and
              freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain
              human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his
              or her point of view and contest the decision.
If the data
              subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated
              individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact
              any employee of the World of Neopia.
ix) Right to withdraw data protection consent
Each data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her
              consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.
If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the
              consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the
              World of Neopia.
The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon
              request to each data subject as to what personal data is stored
              about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall
              correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the
              data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage
              obligations. Please contact our Data Protection Officer to
              exercise any of the rights as set out in this policy.
L. Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of
                PayPal as a payment processor
On this website, the controller has integrated components of
              PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service provider. Payments are
              processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual
              private or business accounts. PayPal is also able to process
              virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a
              PayPal account. A PayPal account is managed via an e-mail address,
              which is why there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it
              possible to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive
              payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer
              protection services.
The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe)
              S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg,
              Luxembourg.
If the data subject chooses "PayPal" as the payment option in the
              online shop during the ordering process, we automatically transmit
              the data of the data subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment
              option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of personal data
              required for payment processing.
The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name,
              last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number,
              mobile phone number, credit or debit card number, expiry date of
              credit or debit card, or other data necessary for payment
              processing. The processing of the purchase contract also requires
              such personal data, which are in connection with the respective
              order.
The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and
              fraud prevention. The controller will transfer personal data to
              PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the
              transmission is given. The personal data exchanged between PayPal
              and the controller for the processing of the data will be
              transmitted by PayPal to economic credit agencies. This
              transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and
              service providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is
              necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be
              processed in the order.
The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the
              handling of personal data at any time from PayPal. A revocation
              shall not have any effect on personal data which must be
              processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual)
              payment processing.
The applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be
              retrieved under
              https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.
M. Legal basis for the processing
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing
              operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing
              purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
              performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as
              is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary
              for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the
              processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR.
The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary
              for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case
              of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company
              is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal
              data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations,
              the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to
              protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
              natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor
              were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance
              data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a
              doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would
              be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.
              f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which
              are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if
              processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
              interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where
              such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental
              rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection
              of personal data.
N. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual
                requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract;
                Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data;
                possible consequences of failure to provide such data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required
              by law (e.g., tax regulations) or can also result from contractual
              provisions (e.g., information on the contractual partner).
              Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data
              subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be
              processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to
              provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract
              with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have
              the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not
              be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data
              subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee
              clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the
              personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for
              the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to
              provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of
              the personal data.
O. Existence of automated decision-making
As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making
              or profiling.
P. International Transfers
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure
              a similar degree of protection is afford to your personal
              information by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards
              is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
                been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for
                personal data.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
                contracts that are in compliance with the GDPR which give
                personal data the same protection it has in the EEA.

Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a

The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.

, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy/:
ID5 Platform Privacy Policy
What is the ID5 Platform (or the "Platform")?
ID5 operates an identity platform for the digital advertising industry.
      By "Platform", we mean that we provide technology that websites, mobile
      apps and publishers of other internet-connected properties (such as
      internet-connected TV's), use to recognize users on their websites,
      mobile apps and other digital media properties (which we collectively
      refer to as "
Digital Properties
"), and that
      advertisers, or companies on an advertiser's behalf, use to target
      advertising to users in the most efficient way possible. Digital
      publishers and other "sellers" want their ads to be relevant to their
      readers, which helps them to offer content for no cost or lower cost.
      Advertisers, advertising agencies, and other "buyers" want to use their
      advertising dollars efficiently by reaching the right audiences, and by
      measuring the effectiveness of their ads. To accomplish these goals, our
      clients – including digital publishers and advertising technology
      platforms and service providers – use our Platform to more efficiently
      and effectively recognize their users and/or to enable their own clients
      to do so. ID5 is not an ad network, a media buyer or seller, or a data
      broker. We do not own digital properties on which we advertise, and we
      engage in advertising only in a limited manner for our own recruiting
      purposes and to advertise to other businesses (not to consumers).
What do we mean by Platform Data?
The Platform is designed to use certain types of information, that
      collectively we call "
Platform Data
". This includes
      information collected by our technology, products and services on the
      Digital Properties ("
Collected Data
"), which may
      include such information as IP address, unique browser or device
      identifiers, and the latitude and longitude of your device when you view
      a website that may want to show you an ad; (ii) information provided or
      uploaded to us or our Platform by our clients ("
Client Data
"), which typically includes a "hashed" copy of your email address
      ("hashing" prevents us from seeing the actual email address); and (iii)
      "
ID5 IDs
" (described below), which are random unique
      identifiers that we create and connect to Collected Data and/or Client
      Data. See "
What Information Do We Collect?
" below for more details on the type of information that may be
      included in Platform Data.
Some Platform Data (for example, cookie IDs, mobile advertising
      identifiers, ID5 IDs, and IP addresses) may identify a particular
      computer or device, and may be considered "Personal Data" or "personal
      information" (or another term with a substantially similar definition
      and obligations) in some jurisdictions, including the European Economic
      Area (see below on the meaning of "Personal Data" under the EU General
      Data Protection Regulation) and certain U.S. states. This data - which
      we call "Personal Data" - allows us to recognize a particular computer
      or device over time. We call cookie IDs, mobile advertising IDs, ID5
      IDs, and other random unique identifiers "
Digital Identifiers
".
Our Platform is not designed to utilize information that by itself
      identifies an individual in the "real world", such as "un-hashed" (i.e.,
      actual) name, address, phone number, email address, or government
      identifier. Instead, it is designed to utilize only Digital Identifiers
      that enable the recognition of a specific device or browser.
For European Jurisdiction data subjects, what is the meaning of
      "Personal Data" under the EU General Data Protection Regulation
      ("GDPR"), and what does this mean for Platform Data?
Under GDPR, "
Personal Data
" means any data relating to
      an individual who can be identified, directly or indirectly, from that
      data. It can take the form of a name or address, and can also extend to
      unique identifiers that do not tell us who an Internet user is in the
      "real world" but may, when combined with other information, allow the
      identification of an individual.
Our Platform does not rely on Personal Data that identifies you as an
      individual in the "real world", such as your actual, un-hashed name,
      email address, or phone number. When you (an Internet user) first visit
      a Digital Property that has integrated our technology, this triggers a
      request to our Platform. When this occurs, we assign an "ID5 ID" to your
      browser or device, which allows the Platform to recognize your browser
      or device the next time it visits another Digital Property that has
      integrated our technology. Such Digital Identifiers are considered
      "Personal Data" under the GDPR.
This allows our clients and certain other third parties selected by our
      clients to sync their own Digital Identifiers against this ID5 ID (see
      "
ID Syncing
" below) so that our clients can
      use their own data on other platforms that they may have associated with
      their own Digital Identifiers.
Glossary of Certain Terms
Browser
: A browser, or web browser, is the user interface or
      application through which you view web Digital Properties. Examples of
      prominent browsers are Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Google's Chrome,
      Apple's Safari, and Mozilla's Firefox.
Cookie
: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web
      browser by a website or Ad Server. By saving information in a cookie,
      websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize web browsers
      from one visit to another or from one website to another. Cookie IDs are
      Digital Identifiers.
ID Syncing
: ID syncing (sometimes also referred to as cookie
      syncing) is a common and long-standing process in the digital
      advertising industry that enables advertisers to link up data from
      multiple advertising platforms. (In other words, it helps advertisers
      buy ads in more than one place and on more than one service.)
Here's an example of how ID syncing works. Let's say you sell a product
      on your website. A customer visits your site. Your website stores a
      cookie to recognize that customer's browser, and the cookie contains an
      ID of 12345. You then associate that ID with information about what the
      customer shopped for on your site. If you want to then use that
      information to advertise to that user, you might go to an online
      advertising marketplace to buy ad space. In order to buy the right ad
      space to show your ads to the right user, you'll need to match your ID,
      which is 12345, to the ID that the marketplace has assigned to the same
      customer (which let's say for this example is ABCDE).
The result is a record that says ID 12345 = Marketplace ID ABCDE. That
      way, when the marketplace offers to sell you ad space to show your ad to
      ABCDE, your system will know that ABCDE is the same as 12345, and you
      can pick the right ad to show the customer.
Interest-Based Advertising
: Interest-based advertising
      associates a user’s activity and interest information, demographic
      information, geographic information, and similar information with a
      browser cookie or other online identifier in order to provide more
      useful and relevant advertising. It is sometimes also called "online
      behavioral advertising", "targeted advertising", "cross-context
      behavioral advertising" or "tailored advertising".
Mobile Advertising Identifiers
: Mobile advertising identifiers
      (e.g., Apple's iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or Google's Android
      Advertising ID (AAID)) are unique IDs that are similar to cookies, but,
      instead of being stored on your web browser, are associated with
      individual mobile devices. They usually are user-resettable. Like other
      Digital Identifiers, Mobile advertising identifiers do not tell us who
      an Internet user is in the "real world", but may, when combined with
      other information, allow the identification of an individual. Mobile
      advertising identifiers are used in connection with apps on your mobile
      device as opposed to websites that you access through a browser.
Cookie Use by the Platform
Although the specific cookies employed on the ID5 Platform may change
      from time to time, this describes how and why the ID5 Platform uses
      cookies. These cookies enable our clients to recognize users and to see
      users' consent choices (including opt-out choices).
The Platform uses unique cookies to distinguish between unique web
        browsers.
The Platform uses cookies with non-unique values for server
        load-balancing and similar technical purposes.
The Platform uses non-unique cookies to store users’ opt-out choices.
Some browsers or other software may be configured to block third-party
      cookies by default.
THE ID5 PLATFORM PRIVACY STATEMENT
Last Modified: October 10, 2023
Overview
This ID5 Platform Privacy Statement (this "Privacy Statement") describes
      how ID5 collects, uses, shares and otherwise processes Platform Data. It
      describes how ID5 may enable or allow clients and third-party providers
      to use Platform Data, but otherwise does not apply to our clients' or
      other third parties' practices. If you are interested in our website
      privacy policy, please
click here
.
What information do we collect and use?
The Platform is designed to collect and use only Platform Data
          (i.e., Collected Data, Client Data, and ID5 IDs) as described in
          this Privacy Statement.
Details
.
How do we collect information?
The Platform may use cookies, pixels, tags, mobile SDKs, and similar
          technologies to collect and store Platform Data about web browsers
          and devices across websites and apps and over time.
Details
.
For what purposes do we use the collected information?
ID5 uses the information collected on the Platform to provide,
          operate, manage, maintain, and enhance the Platform and allow our
          clients to use our Platform. This means facilitating user
          identification; using information for fraud detection and the
          prevention and detection of malicious behavior and maintaining and
          enhancing our products and services (including our Platform),
          including using information for machine learning, optimization and
          statistical analysis.
Details
.
In European Jurisdictions, on what legal basis do we process
          Personal Data?
Where (i) you are a European Economic Area ("
EEA
"),
          United Kingdom or Switzerland (such countries, collectively with the
          EEA, "
European Jurisdictions
") data subject and
          (ii) ID5 is acting as a "controller" of Personal Data relating to
          you, ID5's legal basis for collecting and using such Personal
          depends on the data concerned and the specific context in which we
          collect or use it. With respect to Collected Data that is Personal
          Data in a European Jurisdiction, we generally rely on consent
          obtained for us by the operators of the Digital Properties that use
          our technology or use technology that interacts with our Platform;
          with respect to Client Data that is Personal Data, we rely on
          consent obtained by or on behalf of the particular client that
          provides it to us or our Platform.
Details
.
What information do we share with third parties?
Where permitted, we provide clients access to their Platform Data
          that they collect, acquire, or use on the Platform, and typically
          they may remove it from the Platform for their own use. ID5 may also
          provide Platform Data to our clients and service providers for the
          purpose of operating, managing, maintaining, or enhancing our
          products and services, (including our Platform), including for the
          safety and security of the Platform and the online advertising
          industry, or as required by law. ID5 does not share the information
          collected via the Platform with other third parties, unless legally
          required.
Details
.
How is the information stored and how long is it kept?
Platform Data is stored using generally accepted security standards.
          It is usually aggregated or deleted within 30-90 days, but may be
          retained in the Platform for up to 18 months from the date of
          collection before aggregation or deletion.
Details
.
What are your choices?
For European Jurisdiction data subjects, we are registered as a
            vendor with, and support, the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
(the "
TCF Framework
"). When you visit a Digital
            Property, the TCF Framework is designed to enable Digital
            Properties - which may include our clients - to (i) choose which
            third parties they wish to allow to access your device and
            collect, use and share your Personal Data and (ii) provide dynamic
            transparency and choice to you about each of these third parties
            (e.g., an opportunity for you to consent) in connection with such
            Digital Property, depending on that third-party's use of your
            Personal Data and legal basis.
Various clients and third-party providers using our Platform may
            be accessing your device or collecting, using and sharing your
            Personal Data as independent controllers for different uses and
            based on different legal bases or as processors on behalf of other
            independent controllers.
Web browser users may opt out of the use of the Platform for
            interest-based advertising in their web browser. Mobile app users
            have access to choices provided by certain apps or in their device
            system software.
Details
.
What happens if this Privacy Statement is changed?
Please check this Privacy Statement for changes. The date of the
          last update can be found at the top of this Privacy Statement.

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (Data Subjects of European
      Jurisdictions)
If (i) you are a data subject of a European Jurisdiction and (ii) we are
      acting as the controller of "Personal Data" relating to you, our legal
      basis for processing such Personal Data (see "
What Information Do We Collect?
" above) will depend on the data concerned and the specific context in
      which we collect or use it. With respect to Collected Data that is
      Personal Data of a European Jurisdiction data subject, we generally rely
      on consent obtained for us by the operators of the Digital Properties
      that use our technology or use technology that interacts with our
      Platform; with respect to Client Data that is Personal Data of a
      European Jurisdiction data subject, we rely on consent obtained by or on
      behalf of the particular client that provides it to us or our Platform.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
      legal basis on which we process Personal Data, please contact us at
privacy@id5.io
.
How and Why Do We Share the Information We Collect?
ID5 shares Platform Data with the following third parties:
Clients and their third-party vendors
We provide ID5
        IDs to our clients and, if and as elected by our clients (including,
        if applicable, pursuant to your choices on their Digital Properties),
        our clients’ third-party vendors.
For European Jurisdiction data subjects
, our
            clients may utilize multiple controls to choose the third parties
            with whom we share your information that we collect through our
            clients' use of our Platform including:
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
(the "
TCF Framework
"):
We are registered as a vendor with, and support, the TCF
                    Framework.
When you visit a Digital Property on which the TCF
                    Framework is utilized, the TCF Framework is designed to
                    (i) allow the Digital Property to choose which third
                    parties (e.g., vendors) they wish to allow to access your
                    device and/or collect, use and share your Personal Data
                    and (ii) provide dynamic transparency and choice to you
                    about each of these vendors (e.g., an opportunity for you
                    to consent) in connection with your visit to the Digital
                    Property, depending on that third-party’s use of your data
                    and legal basis.
Platform-provided "controls" ("
Platform Controls
") with respect to about third parties operating through our
                Platform:
Our Platform provides our clients with information about
                    the other clients operating through our Platform,
                    providing transparency for disclosure purposes and
                    "allow-listing" capabilities – to create lists of approved
                    companies – to control which third parties may receive,
                    use and share your information
For users who are not European Jurisdiction data
              subjects
, we provide our clients with Platform Controls, including our
            allow-listing capabilities, to control which third parties may
            receive, use, and share your information.
Vendors
We share Platform Data with, and enable the
        collection of Platform Data by, our vendors (including data center
        providers, hosting providers, data analytics providers, and
        anti-fraud, technology and security providers), so that they can
        provide services to us, including to detect and prevent malicious
        activity or fake traffic and to provide analytics and reporting about
        our products and services. Our vendors are subject to obligations
        consistent with this Privacy Statement and appropriate confidentiality
        and security measures.
Legal Rights and Compliance with Law
We may also
        disclose Platform Data in the event that we reasonably suspect
        malicious activity or fake traffic or when we reasonably believe it is
        required by law, subpoena or other legal process, including to meet
        national security or law enforcement requirements.
ID5 Affiliates
We share Platform Data with other
        companies in the ID5 group of companies to use for any of the purposes
        described in this Privacy Statement.
Business Transfers
We may transfer Platform Data to a
        successor entity in connection with a corporate merger; consolidation;
        sale of assets, equity, or business; bankruptcy; or other corporate
        change.
How Is Platform Data Stored, and How Long Is It Kept?
Security
ID5 uses generally accepted industry security standards to protect
        information transmitted over or stored on the Platform.
We review our information collection, storage and processing
        practices, including physical security measures, to guard against
        unauthorized access to systems.
We restrict access to information to employees, contractors and agents
        who need the information in order to process it for us, and who are
        subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be
        disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Please note, however, that no transmission or storage of information
        can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure. Once we receive
        Platform Data, we will use strict procedures and security features to
        try to prevent unauthorized access. Please also be mindful that we are
        not responsible for the security measures of third parties.
Retention
We never store any information longer than we need it. Platform Data
        is usually aggregated or deleted within 30-90 days, but may be
        retained in the Platform for up to 18 months for specific clients and
        for use for security and the detection and prevention of fraud and
        invalid traffic from the date of collection before aggregation or
        deletion. When we no longer need the information we collect, it is
        deleted or aggregated.
Aggregated anonymized information is used for reporting and analysis,
        and may be stored in the Platform indefinitely.
When third-party vendors receive information through us or clients
        remove their information from the Platform, their storage and
        retention of the removed information is governed by their own privacy
        policies and applicable laws, rules, and/or regulations.
What Are Your Choices?
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
: We are
      registered as a vendor with, support, and encourage our clients to use,
      the
TCF Framework
, which is designed to provide European Jurisdiction data subjects with
      dynamic transparency into and choice about the various third parties
      used on Digital Properties on which the TCF Framework is utilized. If
      you are a European Jurisdiction data subject, the TCF Framework is
      designed to enable Digital Properties – which may include our clients –
      to (i) choose which third parties (which may include ID5) they wish to
      allow to access your device and collect, use and share your personal
      data and (ii) provide dynamic transparency and choice to you about each
      of these third parties (e.g., an opportunity for you to consent) in
      connection with such Digital Property, depending on that third-party's
      use of your Personal Data and legal basis for such usage.
ID5 Web Browser Opt Out
: If you have not already chosen to do
      so, you may visit
https://id5-sync.com/privacy
to opt out of having the Platform used to enable our clients to more
      efficiently serve you relevant ads. When you opt out, an opt-out cookie
      (from id5-sync.com) will be stored in your web browser. The Platform
      will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt-out cookie, and
      will apply your choice to all companies using the Platform. If you block
      or delete the ID5 opt-out cookie, you will cease to be opted out with
      respect to the Platform and will need to perform the opt-out process
      again.
ID5 Web Browser Opt In
: If you have previously chosen to opt
      out, but would now like to opt in, you may visit
https://id5-sync.com/privacy
to opt in to having the Platform used to enable our clients to more
      efficiently serve you relevant ads. This does not overwrite any consent
      settings you may select on a given Digital Property.
Important things to note about the ID5 web browser opt out:
Blocked cookies
The opt-out cookie may not work if
        your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.
Deleting or protecting opt outs
If you delete your
        cookies, you will need to opt out again. There are browser plugins to
        help you preserve your opt-out cookies. For more information, please
        visit
https://www.aboutads.info
.
Only this browser
The opt out only applies to the
        browser profile in which you set it. For example, if you set the opt
        out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt out will not be
        active in Chrome. To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the
        opt-out process. This is because the cookies cannot be read between
        different browsers or browser profiles.
The opt out does not block or delete cookies
It also
        does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes
        other than interest-based advertising. If you opt out, data may still
        be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see
        advertising. Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of
        the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to block or delete
        cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.
To access the opt outs of other online advertising companies, visit the
      consumer choice pages of such organizations, as follows:
EU
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance,
        at
youronlinechoices.com
(by clicking the "Your ad choices" link after selecting the
        appropriate country)
US
Digital Advertising Alliance, at
https://optout.aboutads.info/
Network Advertising Initiative, at
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
Mobile App Opt Out:
Mobile device system software such as Apple
      iOS or Google Play Services provide mechanisms that allow users to opt
      out of the use of information about their usage of mobile apps to
      deliver targeted ads to their mobile device. For more information, or to
      opt out using these mechanisms, consult your device settings ("Opt out
      of Interest-Based Ads" on Android devices and "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS
      devices).
European Jurisdiction Data Subject Rights
If you are a data subject of a European Jurisdiction, you have certain
      rights and protections under the law regarding the collection,
      processing, and use of information about you. As stated above, the
      information we collect about you when you visit Digital Properties that
      use our technology may include certain identifiers that are considered
      "Personal Data" under European law.
If you are a data subject of a European Jurisdiction and certain
      requirements are fulfilled and/or under certain circumstances, you have
      the right: (i) to access and obtain a copy of your Personal Data; (ii)
      to erasure of your Personal Data; (iii) to rectification or updating of
      your Personal Data; (iv) to object to the processing of your Personal
      Data; (v) to restrict the processing of your Personal Data; and (vi) to
      data portability (i.e., to be provided with a copy of your Personal Data
      in a structured, commonly-used, and machine-readable format, and/or to
      have such a copy provided to a third party). If you are interested in
      exercising any of these rights, you may do so via our privacy web form
      (available by
clicking here
)
      or you may email us at
privacy@id5.io
. Please note that, as
      the process we currently use to verify/authenticate and process
      "Requests to Know/Access", "Requests to Delete", "Requests to Correct",
      and "Requests for Data Portability" requires us to recognize an online
      identifier, if you submit such a "Request to Know/Access" by email, it
      generally will require more time and at least one more step than
      submitting your request via the privacy web form.
In addition, you also have the right to withdraw your consent at any
      time. If you wish to exercise such right with respect to interest-based
      advertising, you can do so through the mechanisms and methods set forth
      above under object to the processing of your Personal Data.
Our Platform is designed to collect the minimum amount of Personal Data
      about you that we believe is necessary to provide our products and
      services. Because our Platform is not designed to collect information
      that directly identifies an individual, sometimes it is not feasible for
      us to provide individuals with information that is tied to their
      identities.
Also, as a data subject of a European Jurisdiction, you have the right
      to lodge a complaint about our processing of Personal Data with a
      European Data Protection Authority, in particular the Member State of
      your residence, place of work or alleged infringement of the GDPR. For
      contact details of your relevant local Data Protection Authority, please

"Collected Personal Data"
), (ii) Personal Data provided to us by or on behalf of our clients
      (
"Client Personal Data"
), and (iii) our ID5 IDs, which
      are Digital Identifiers (see table below). Even though Client Personal
      Data is provided to us, we may be considered to have "collected" such
      data under US State Privacy Laws.
We collect (and during the last 12 months have collected) the following
      categories of personal information, from the following categories of
      Personal Data, and for the following business or commercial purposes:

We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose sensitive Personal Data
      through our Platform, products, or services.
For information on how long we intend to retain each category of
      Personal Data, please see "How Is Platform Data Stored, and How Long Is
      It Kept? – Retention" above.
Disclosure of Personal Data
For purposes of applicable US State Privacy Laws:
"Sales"/"Sharing"
: we "sell" (as defined by the
        applicable US State Privacy Law) and/or "share" (as defined by CCPA)
        (and, during the 12 months prior to the "Last Modified" date at the
        top of this Privacy Statement, have sold and/or shared) "identifiers"
        (a category of Personal Data) that we derive from each of the above
        categories of Personal Data to our clients in connection with their
        (and their respective clients’) advertising activities, including
        cross-context behavioral advertising and targeted advertising (each,
        as defined by the applicable US State Privacy Law); however, we do not
        knowingly sell or share the Personal Data of children under the age of
        16 without required affirmative authorization; and
"Disclosures for a Business Purpose"
: we disclose
        (and have disclosed during the 12 months prior to the "Last Modified"
        date at the top of this Privacy Statement) each of the above
        categories of Personal Data for a "business purpose" (as defined by
        CCPA) to "service providers"/"processors" (each, as defined by the
        applicable US State Privacy Law) that perform certain services on our
        behalf, such as data center providers, hosting service providers, and
        data analytics providers, and anti-fraud, technology and security
        providers.
Methods of Submitting Requests
If you are a resident of a U.S. state with an effective US State Privacy
      Law, you may submit requests to exercise your "Right to Know/Access",
      your "Right to Delete", your "Right to Correct", and/or your "Right to
      Data Portability" via any of the following methods:
By web form
, available by clicking
here
By toll-free telephone
, to:
1-888-821-2911
Please note the following:
As the process we currently use to verify/authenticate and process
        "Requests to Know/Access", "Requests to Delete", "Requests to
        Correct", and "Requests for Data Portability" requires us to recognize
        an online identifier, if you submit such a "Request to Know/Access"
        via the telephone number listed above, it generally will require more
        time and at least one more step than submitting your request via the
        web form.
If you are opted out of interest-based advertising on the applicable
        web browser, we may not be able to verify/authenticate or process your
        "Request to Delete", your "Request to Know/Access", your "Request to
        Correct", or your "Request for Data Portability", since we may have no
        reasonable method of connecting your request with the Personal Data we
        previously collected about you.
If we notify you that we were unable to verify/authenticate your
        "Request to Delete", your "Request to Know/Access", your "Request to
        Correct", or your "Request for Data Portability", you may appeal our
        determination by emailing us at
privacy@id5.io
and indicating why
        you disagree with our determination (including by providing additional
        information to support your request).
Because (i) our Platform is designed to collect the minimum amount of
        Personal Data about you that we believe is necessary to provide our
        products and services and (ii) our Platform is not designed to collect
        information that directly identifies an individual, it is generally
        not feasible for us to provide individuals information that is tied to
        their identities.
If we utilize "de-identification" to comply with a "Request to Delete"
        or similar obligation with respect to Personal Data, we will maintain
        and use such data in de-identified form and will not attempt to
        re-identify such de-identified data.
If you are a resident of a U.S. state with an effective US State Privacy
      Law, you may exercise your applicable US State Privacy Law "Right(s) to
      Opt Out" via the following method(s):
By web form
, available by clicking
here
Via the "Global Privacy Control" user-enabled "universal opt-out
          mechanism"
, if such a universal opt-out mechanism is legally required as a
        method of opting out by the applicable US State Privacy Law (for more
        information regarding Global Privacy Control, please visit the Global
        Privacy Control website: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
Please note that we currently affect US State Privacy Law opt-out rights
      elections by performing our web browser opt-out process, which results
      in an opt-out cookie (from id5-sync.com) being stored in your web
      browser. Such elections – including through the Global Privacy Control
      user-enabled "universal opt-out mechanism" – will be processed only with
      respect to the applicable web browser. For more information about such
      opt-out, please see "What Are Your Choices? – Important things to note
      about the ID5 web browser opt out" above.
Authorized Agents
If you are a resident of a US state with an effective US State Privacy
      Law, if and as required by that US State Privacy Law, you may use an
      "authorized agent" to submit requests to exercise your "right to
      know/access", your "right to delete", your "right to correct", your
      "right to data portability", and/or your US State Privacy Law "right(s)
      to opt-out" (as applicable) on your behalf under that US State Privacy
      Law. Your authorized agent will need to provide us with a copy of a
      written permission that is signed by you and indicates that you have
      provided such authorization.
"Do Not Track"
ID5 has not yet developed a response to browser "Do Not Track" signals,
      and we do not change any of our data collection practices when we
      receive such signals. We will continue to evaluate potential responses
      to "Do Not Track" signals in light of industry developments or legal
      changes.
While we do not support "Do Not Track" signals, we do honor opt-out
      preference signals received from Global Privacy Control as the
      applicable California consumer’s election to opt out of the sale and/or
      sharing (each, as defined by CCPA) of their Personal Data, to the extent
      technically feasible.
For more information on your privacy choices, please see "What are your
      choices?" above and also above in this "Your Rights under Certain U.S.
      State General Privacy Laws" section.

Our users’ privacy is important to us, and we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protection for children on the Sites permitting such users. Our privacy practices are guided by California Consumer Privacy Act, and as amended and the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as well as all applicable data privacy laws in the United States. In all cases, younger users should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website or mobile application, and we encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information. In order for a child to fully participate on any of the Sites, no personally identifiable information is collected from a child until such time as verifiable parental or guardian consent is received from the child’s parent or guardian. In order to register on our site as a user, the child’s parent or guardian must activate their account. Users may choose to play as Guests without the collection of information, recording of game play, prizes or gems when users return.

Do Not Sell My Personal Information
:
We do not “sell” your personal information that directly identifies you. However, the CCPA’s broad definitions of “sale” and “personal information” may deem the common flow of information in the digital analytics and advertising ecosystem to be a sale. We use online analytics to measure the ways users engage with our websites and apps. These analytics, in turn, inform how we perform online advertising. In order to provide these analytics and facilitate online advertising, we use third-parties that collect device identifiers and place tags, cookies, beacons, and similar tracking mechanisms on our Sites.
To the extent that we sell your personal information, you may have the right to direct us to stop selling your personal information if we do so. Please contact us if you wish to exercise this right.

here
.
Who Else Is Collecting Information:
We may use a number of advertising networks, analytics service providers and other such companies to, for example, serve advertisements or analyze the performance of the Sites. These companies may use their own unique identifiers, and their use of these technologies is within their control and not ours. These companies may use the information they collect from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
For more information about these third parties and how you might be able to control how they use your information, please go
here
.
How You Can Control Your Own Information:
We make every attempt to allow you to control the way that we use personally identifiable information that you choose to provide.
You have the option of declining any future offers of information about enhancements, new products, promotions or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" we may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.
You may have choices about the use of your information by third parties wishing to deliver certain targeted advertising to you.
You have the right to access, update and correct factual inaccuracies in any personally identifiable information we collect about you.
Parents and guardians can review any personally identifiable information collected about their children and request that such information be deleted and/or that no further information be collected.

I. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.
We may request or collect certain information when you visit the Sites. However, users are required to share only the information that is reasonably necessary to participate in the particular activity.
A. Registration Information:
The information required to register varies by Site, but may include: (a) birth date; (b) gender; (c) country; (d) state; (e) zip code; (f) user name and password; (g) wireless telephone number; (h) email address; and (i) other profile information such as avatar preferences, communications preferences, and interests. Children under the age of thirteen (13) may be asked to provide his or her parent's or guardian's email address. Users or their parents/guardians will receive an activation email and must follow the procedures or otherwise agree to the terms within the activation email within a certain time period to activate the account. Accounts not activated within that time period will be deleted. Included in the activation email is a verifiable parental or guardian consent form that may be completed by a child’s parent or guardian permitting the collection of certain personally identifiable information or allowing the child to enter certain free entry text on the Sites.
Registration information is used to enable users to take advantage of site offerings; respond to user’s requests for products, services, and information; manage games; serve appropriate material; customize the content you see when you visit the Sites; and offer users special offers and promotions from the Sites and World of Neopia' companies and its subsidiaries and affiliates as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.
B. Computer Information Collected by Us:
When users come to a Site, we may automatically collect certain information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the type of computer operating system, the user's IP address, the web browser, UDID (for certain mobile devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site, the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Sites, interactions with e-mail messages sent by a Site or World of Neopia' companies (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies (see below), information regarding the internet service provider, and other standard server log information ("Computer Information").
We may use cookies, web beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) on the Sites. "Cookies" are text files that help store user preferences and activity. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. “Tokens” are unique persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server to a user’s device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication for a user’s cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie. The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect Computer Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.
We may use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between certain Sites without logging into each Site, enable the internal functioning of the Sites, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on the Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages originating from the Sites or World of Neopia' companies (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Sites. These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional other information regarding your visits to the Sites (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features, purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other information across multiple sessions on the Sites and other websites offered by World of Neopia' companies and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the device you use to access the Site (“Identifier”). An Identifier may be automatically assigned to any device you use to access the Sites.
By visiting a Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to set and access Cookies on your device and track your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use in the emails we send to you.
While none of our Sites track our users for behavioral advertising purposes we feel it is important for our users to be aware of their choices when it comes to their online privacy. Click
here
for more information about online behavioral advertising. World of Neopia does not use any behaviorally target advertising on our sites.
Our Third Party Advertising Service Providers (as defined in Section D) do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to other information about you.
You have a number of options with respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Sites.
You may be able to have the device you use to access the Sites warn you each time a cookie or other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings. This is done through your browser on the device you use to access the Sites. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.
Please be aware that certain areas and features of the Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with Tracking Technologies, and that disabling Tracking Technologies might prevent you from accessing such content.
C. Computer Information Collected By Others:
the Sites may uses the services of third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit the Sites..
The Sites use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements, or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Sites (“Targeting Services”) in an aggregate and anonymous form.
These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Sites. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you. In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may collect aggregate log data separately and independently from what the Sites collect.
You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not the Sites. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and those sites may use the information they collect from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We are not responsible for any action or omission by the third parties in relation to the collection, use or disclosure of cookie information, IP addresses, identifiers or other personal information collected by the third party. We encourage you to research and direct any of your questions in this regard to these third parties.
Some of these Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network
Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool
and/or the
Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising
. Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices.
Please note the following with respect to opting out of Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and advertisers:
The opt-out tools discussed above are “cookie based.”
This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices. If you opt-out but then use the controls in your browser to delete all Tracking Technologies, you may have to opt-out again, a second time, in order to re-establish your opt-out preferences.
Opt-outs are browser-specific.
This means, for example, that if you opt out while using a particular internet browser, this choice will not affect the collection of information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use another internet browser on the same device. It also means that opting out on one device will not affect the collection of information by Tracking Technologies on other devices you may use to access the Sites.
Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads. Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Sites.
Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.
D. Contests and Sweepstakes:
The Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes. To enter these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide your first name and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the contest or sweepstakes. For children under the age of 13, we may collect the child’s e-mail address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store such child’s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes, and use it for notification if he or she is the winner
following the child’s parent or guardian’s consent. For contests or sweepstakes on such sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the option to have the child's entry deleted.
E. Electronic Postcards and Messages:
The Sites may provide users the opportunity to send electronic postcards and “wish lists” of items they want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the user’s behalf, email messages to family and/or friends. To do so, users must provide the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. Users must only provide email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive such electronic postcards or email messages. Email addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested postcard or email message and are anonymized and deleted from our system once the postcard or message is sent. In some cases, we may offer users an incentive (e.g., points to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the user's family or friends. In such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal requirements. Please note that this feature may not be available to users in certain regions or countries.
F. Electronic Newsletters:
Users can provide their email addresses to receive email newsletters and promotions from World of Neopia' companies, and our business partners. Users may change their preferences regarding emails at any time through the unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for certain Sites, by logging into and changing the preferences for their account.
G. Interactive Features and Services:
Some of the Sites may offer interactive features and services, such as message boards, chat rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes, messaging services, and member profile pages. For a user who is a child under the age of 13 years, we either will obtain parental consent before allowing the child to use these interactive features and services or will use reasonable technical measures to anonymize and delete all personal information from a child’s postings before they are made public and also anonymize and delete such information from our records. We use the information collected through interactive features and services to enable you to participate in such features and services.
H. Wireless Marketing Services:
Consistent with local law, appropriately aged users may have the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and/or wireless devices. To do so, users may be asked to provide their telephone number, email address, carrier’s name, and/or their opinion regarding certain goods and/or services. Users must opt in to receive wireless marketing material from businesses within World of Neopia companies through one of the following methods: (a) filling out the registration information on any The Sites’ wireless marketing registration page; or (b) sending a specific word, code or symbol via a text message to a telephone number designated by us in any promotional material. The user may also be asked to confirm his or her acceptance to receive such wireless marketing services.
Users that register for wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from the Sites or World of Neopia' companies. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will World of Neopia' companies be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by such user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.
I.
Geolocation
Information:
We may collect and store information about your geographic location, but we will only collect
precise geolocation information
sufficient to identify street name and name of a city or town on the Sites that either are directed to users over the
age of 13
and only if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information. We use this information, for example, to enable users to take advantage of Site offerings; respond to user’s requests for products, services, and information; manage games; customize the content users see when visiting the Sites; and to offer users special offers and promotions from The Sites and World of Neopia' companies, as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to our users. By accepting this Privacy Policy and using the applicable Site, you hereby consent to the collection and storage of such geolocation information as described above. You have the right to limit our use and disclosure of your precise geolocation information to certain enumerated business purposes under the laws of California. To make a request, please send an e-mail
to
privacy@neopets.com
.
J. Financial Information:
We collect and use financial information, such as credit card numbers and security codes, for the limited purposes described below.
Consumer Products
: Certain Sites provide pages and/or links to pages offering users who are of legal age to form a binding contract the opportunity to purchase consumer products (the "Shops"). To do so, users need to provide contact, shipping, billing and credit information. These pages may be hosted and operated by a third party that is independent and separate from the Sites. The third party collects personal information about shop users and may share this information with us. We use this information to process the order and to send order confirmations via email, as well as to send information about products and services of interest and as otherwise required by law. Before providing information on these pages, we encourage you to review the posted privacy policies which govern such third party’s use of your information, as they may differ from ours.
Virtual Items/Memberships
: Some of the Sites may offer memberships, online subscriptions and/or virtual items for use in conjunction with the Sites' games. When you enter into a transaction for a membership, subscription, virtual item or similar transaction, you may be asked to provide the credit card and/or billing information and email address. We will use this information to fulfill your specified requests, as well as to inform you about additional products or service opportunities and as otherwise required by law.
Please also see the information regarding payment processors in Section II(B) below.
K. Other Data Collection and Use.
We collect search query information when users search for information on the Sites. We also collect information from users when they contact us with questions and comments.
We may use this information, along with any of the other information described above, to (i) analyze use of the Sites and understand and improve our service offerings; (ii) prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; and (iii) for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.
We may combine information collected through the Sites with information we collect from other sources (e.g., social media integration services), other World of Neopia' company’s sites, offline records or publicly available information). It is your responsibility to provide complete and accurate information and to keep such information up to date. We are not responsible for any problem or liability arising from your failure to do so.
II. DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES

Consistent with local law, appropriately aged users may have the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and/or wireless devices. To do so, users may be asked to provide their telephone number, email address, carrier’s name, and/or their opinion regarding certain goods and/or services. Users must opt in to receive wireless marketing material from businesses within World of Neopia' companies through one of the following methods: (a) filling out the registration information on any The Sites’ wireless marketing registration page; or (b) sending a specific word, code or symbol via a text message to a telephone number designated by us in any promotional material.

Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will World of Neopia' companies be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by such user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.
J. Geolocation Information:
We may collect and store information about your geographic location, but we will only collect precise geolocation information sufficient to identify street name and name of a city or town on The Sites that either are directed to users over the age of 13 and only if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information. We use this information, for example, to enable users to take advantage of Site offerings; respond to user’s requests for products, services, and information; manage games; customize the content users see when visiting the Sites; and to offer users special offers and promotions from The Sites and World of Neopia' companies, as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to our users. By accepting this Privacy Policy and using the applicable Site, you hereby consent to the collection and storage of such geolocation information as described above.
K. Financial Information:
We collect and use financial information, such as credit card numbers and security codes, for the limited purposes described below.
Consumer Products: Certain of the Sites provide pages and/or links to pages offering users who are of legal age to form a binding contract the opportunity to purchase consumer products (the "Shops"). To do so, users need to provide contact, shipping, billing and credit information. These pages may be hosted and operated by a third party that is independent and separate from the Sites. This third party collects personal information about shop users and may share this information with us. We use this information to process the order and to send order confirmations via email, as well as to send information about products and services of interest and as otherwise required by law. Before providing information on these pages, we encourage you to review the posted privacy policies which govern such third party’s use of your information, as they may differ from ours.
Virtual Items/Memberships: Some of the Sites may offer memberships, online subscriptions and/or virtual items for use in conjunction with the Sites' games. When you enter into a transaction for a membership, subscription, virtual item or similar transaction, you may be asked to provide the credit card and/or billing information and email address. We will use this information to fulfill your specified requests, as well as to inform you about additional products or service opportunities and as otherwise required by law. Please also see the information regarding payment processors in Section II(B) below.
L. Other Data Collection and Use.
We collect search query information when users search for information on the Sites. We also collect information from users when they contact us with questions and comments.

For example, we may partner with a greeting card company, software manufacturer, social media plugin provider, or mobile phone provider to offer you electronic cards, games, social networking, or text messaging services. These partners operate websites and services that are separate and independent from the Sites and, accordingly, may have their own privacy policies. If you consent or register with one of our partners, that means you grant the Sites permission to give your registration and other information, including e-mail address, to that third party. If you have identified yourself as residing in the EEA, we will not share your email address or other personally identifiable information with third parties for advertising purposes unless you have "opted-in."
In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies to gather information about you. Please see Section I(D) above for more detailed information regarding such use of Tracking Technologies.

VI. ONLINE SAFETY.
Involvement in your family’s online lives is the most important safety tool available. We encourage you to use the following guidelines as starting point for discussing safety and privacy concerns with your child:
Never give out your personal information online.
Would you tell a stranger who you are and where you live? No way! Well chatting online is just like talking to strangers (except online, you can't even SEE them!) SO never give anyone your whole name, address or phone number on the internet, in email, in an instant message or in a chat room. If you know your Social Security Number or credit card or bank account number, definitely do not give those out either. And while you're at it, don't post anyone else's information, and be careful telling other people online the name of your school, sports team or favorite hang out. That information is yours and we want to keep it that way.
Don't use your real name in your screen name.
And while you're at it, don't include your age or your hometown either. You may think your screen name is super creative, but if it says too much about you, people you don't know can find out more about you then you think.
Keep your password to yourself.
Giving out your password is like giving your brother or sister the key to your room. Do you want them in there checking out all of your stuff whenever they feel like it? NO way! Same goes for your personal stuff online.
Read the rules and privacy options for websites that let you connect with others online.
We mean really read 'em. Some sites only let certain people who have registered read posts, chat and look at other users' webpages. Others let anyone who comes to the site check out everything. No matter which kind of site you're on, find out if you can restrict your information so that it can only be seen by the people you choose.
Only share stuff online that you don't mind anyone seeing.
Anyone can use the internet and most people do. That includes your parents, your friends' parents, your teachers, and the creepy guy in the back of math class who never raises his hand. If you want private info to stay private, don't post it online.
Once you post something online, it stays online.
You can delete something you've typed or posted from a site, but people can get to older versions of that site where your info still exists. If you're not sure you should say something on the internet, you probably shouldn't.
Don't download anything if you don't know who it's from.
Downloads can give your computer viruses, mess up your applications and even cause your email server to send messages with your name on them to people you don't know. You can set the preferences on your computer to warn you about downloads before it opens them. So stop and think before you download anything you're not sure of. You don't know where that thing has been.
Keep your online friendships online.
There are all kinds of cool people using the internet. But there's no way of keeping the creeps out. If someone you met online wants to meet you in person, tell an adult. If you do end up meeting face to face bring a parent or another close adult with you.
And finally, if you feel unsafe, tell an adult.
If someone or something online is making you uncomfortable, tell a parent, a teacher or another adult you trust. Ask the adult to help you report the incident to the website, or if necessary to the police. Your actions might end up helping a lot of other people too.
VII. LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES.
The websites that comprise the Sites may contain links to other sites, including those of sponsors, advertisers, social networking platforms, and survey companies. These other websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours. We encourage users to other websites to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those websites.
VIII. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from us (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact us at World of Neopia, Inc.,

IX. GDPR (for European Economic Area Customers)
We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the World of Neopia. The use of the internet pages of the World of Neopia is possible without any indication of personal data. However, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our Sites, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we will obtain consent from the data subject.
The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the World of Neopia. By means of this data protection declaration, we would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
As the controller, the World of Neopia has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through the Sites. However, internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g., by telephone.
1. Definitions
The data protection declaration of the World of Neopia is based on the terms used under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.
In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:
a) Personal data
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person . An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly (“data subject”), in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
b) Data subject
Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.
c) Processing
Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, transfer, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
d) Restriction of processing
Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
e) Profiling
Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location, movements, or generally have a legal impact on the data subject.
f) Pseudonymisation
Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing
Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
h) Processor
Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
i) Recipient
Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
j) Third party
Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

3. Cookies
The Internet pages of the World of Neopia uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an internet browser.
Many internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier for the cookie. It consists of a character string through which internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, the World of Neopia can provide the users of the Sites with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our Sites can be optimized with the user in mind. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our Sites. The website user that uses cookies, e.g., does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our Sites by means of a corresponding setting of the internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely available.
4. Collection of general data and information
The website of the World of Neopia collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. The general data collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Site, (6) an internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
When using these general data and information, the World of Neopia does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our Sites correctly, (2) optimize the content of our Sites as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the World of Neopia analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
5. Registration on our website
The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for the purposes prescribed in Part I of the Privacy Policy by the controller. The controller may request transfer from the data subject to one or more processors (e.g., a parcel service) that also uses the data subject’s personal data for a purpose which is attributable the purpose or one of the lawful bases of processing.
By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address-assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject-date, and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary provision of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to correct the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.
6. Subscription to our newsletters
On the website of the World of Neopia, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise's newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data is transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.
The World of Neopia informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. Our newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers and consents for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.
During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.
The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. Data subjects may unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.
7. Newsletter-Tracking
The newsletter of the World of Neopia contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the World of Neopia may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.
Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. The World of Neopia automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.
8. Comments function in the blog on the website
The World of Neopia offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be commented on by third parties.
If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and published, as well as information on the date of the commentary and on the user's (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP address takes place for security reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This collected personal data will not be passed to third parties, unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.
9. Subscription to comments in the blog on the website
The comments made in the blog of the World of Neopia may be subscribed to by third parties. In particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a particular blog post.
If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The option to subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time by the data subject.
10. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this allowed under the GDPR.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by GDPR expires, the personal data are routinely pseudonymized or erased in accordance with legal requirements.

22. Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of PayPal as a payment processor
On this website, the controller has integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service provider. Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts. PayPal is also able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it possible to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer protection services.
The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.
If the data subject chooses "PayPal" as the payment option in the online shop during the ordering process, we automatically transmit the data of the data subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of personal data required for payment processing.
The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number, credit or debit card number, expiry date of credit or debit card, or other data necessary for payment processing. The processing of the purchase contract also requires such personal data, which are in connection with the respective order.
The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The controller will transfer personal data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given.
The personal data exchanged between PayPal and the controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to economic credit agencies. This transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.
The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from PayPal. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing.
The applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be retrieved under https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.
23. Legal basis for the processing
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR.
The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
24. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g., information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
25. Existence of automated decision-making
As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.
26. International
Transfers
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afford to your personal information by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts that are in compliance with the GDPR which give personal data the same protection it has in the EEA.
