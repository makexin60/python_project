You agree that we are under no obligation to accept or act on any instructions you provide to us by email. If you send us confidential information by email, we will not be liable if it is lost or intercepted, altered or misused by someone else. If you send us an email, you agree that we may (at our sole discretion) respond to you by email, and provide by email any confidential information that you have requested; you also agree that we will not be liable if the information we provide to you by email, as contemplated in this section, is lost or intercepted, altered or misused by someone else.

We may deal with your legal representative (for example, by way of power of attorney or if deceased, your estate representative).

You release us from any claim or liability when acting upon the instructions of such attorney or other legal representative.
Protecting your card, PIN and password
Your card allows you to access your accounts as specified by the product features of each account; by bank machine,
Interac
Debit,
Interac
Flash, Debit Mastercard, phone, and online banking. You agree that you will not let anyone else use your card.
In order to keep all dealings confidential, you will not disclose your PIN or password to anyone else. You should be aware that communication by cellular phone or other non-secure methods may be intercepted. We can't guarantee confidentiality if you choose to communicate to us by these means.
You will memorize your PIN or password and not record them anywhere. If you think someone else may know your PIN or password you will change it and notify us immediately.
When choosing a PIN and password, you must not use the same for both. Also, when choosing a PIN and password, do not use all or any part of: a password or code you use for any other service; your name, or a close relative’s; birth date, telephone number or address; a card or account number; or any other word or number which can be easily obtained or guessed by someone else.
You will take other precautionary measures to protect your account, including always shielding your transactions from the view of others, and ensuring your card is returned to you after each transaction.
The electronic device you use may be vulnerable to viruses or online attacks that seek to intercept or alter information including sensitive information that you provide through the internet. To reduce the chances of harm, you should take all reasonable precautions, including ensuring that any electronic device you use to access online banking has an up-to-date anti-virus program, anti-spyware program and a firewall, if such security measures are available for your electronic device. We will not under any circumstances be liable to you for any losses resulting from your failure to use up-to-date anti-virus software, anti-spyware software and a firewall on the electronic device you use to access online banking, if such security measures are available for the electronic device you used.
To prevent unauthorized access to your accounts, you must sign off of online banking, close your browser, or sign off of the mobile banking applications used by you for mobile banking, as soon as you finish using them. We will not under any circumstances be liable to you for any losses resulting from your failure to sign off of online banking after you have finished using it, regardless of how online banking was accessed.

You fail to remove your card from a bank machine during a deposit transaction. The transaction may be cancelled and any deposits (including cash) may be ejected from the bank machine without credit to your account.
You will not be responsible for losses which are beyond your control or, in other words if there was nothing you could have done to prevent loss.
This includes:
Losses due to technical problems, system malfunctions or our errors
Losses which occur after your card has been cancelled, or after you have notified us that your card was lost or stolen or notified us that someone else knows or may know your PIN or password
Losses which occur when you unintentionally contribute to someone else’s use of your card, PIN or password. However, for this to apply, what you did (or did not do) must have been beyond your control and you must cooperate fully in the investigation.
You will be responsible for losses, if you contribute to someone else using your card, PIN or password, but only up to your daily bank machine withdrawal, Debit Mastercard and
Interac
Debit purchase limits (your daily withdrawal limit is in Canadian dollars for all countries, with the exception of the US where your limits are expressed in US dollars), and

You are not able to assign or restrict which fingerprint(s) can access mobile banking. If any fingerprint(s) in addition to yours are stored on your electronic device, you should not set up Touch ID.
If losses occur by telephone or online banking
You will be responsible for all losses that result from your own use of your card or PIN and your password. You will also be responsible for any losses that result from any use by a third party of your card, PIN or passwords, including, without limitation, use by a service provider that provides an online account aggregation service, which retrieves, consolidates and presents your accounts for the sole purpose of allowing you to view your accounts in one place, that you authorized to use your card, PIN, or passwords. You will not be responsible for losses which occur after you advise us that:
An unauthorized person may be using your card
Your card has been lost or stolen
Due to circumstances beyond your control, someone else knows or may know your password or PIN
Under this Section, losses from your account may not be limited to your account balance if the account has overdraft protection or a credit limit.

In this case, you must notify us of the dispute within 60 days of the later of the date of purchase and the expected date of delivery. In some circumstances, such as where the merchant has not provided you with the goods or services you purchased or the goods or services are not as described, we may be able to assist you (but not in the case of disputes about quality or suitability, nor can we assist you with PIN-authorized transactions). If the transaction is reversed you assign us all the rights you have against the merchant concerning the transaction.
If you request that we initiate an arbitration with Mastercard on your behalf, you agree to pay any fee charged by Mastercard for such arbitration and authorize us to debit your account for the amount of such fee or to deduct such fee from any amounts awarded by Mastercard.

Some merchants may process an authorizing transaction (which may exceed the amount of your purchase). This authorizing transaction will either remove the funds from your account or place a hold on the funds for up to 2 business days. The reversal or hold removal may occur after the purchase transaction is processed
.
Advance payment transactions
When you conduct a transaction using your card in advance of the actual consumption of the good and/or service, including reserving goods and/or services such as hotel reservations or car rentals, the funds will be debited immediately from your account by the merchant and the amount may be different from the final purchase amount.
Restricted transactions

You agree to allow us to set and change with or without notice to you, daily limits on bank machines, card, phone or banking transactions.
Effective time for transactions
Transactions you do on a non-business day, or after the cut-off time on a business day, will be reflected in your account as having been done on the next business day. We call Saturdays, Sundays, and national holidays non-business days.
Purchases, refunds and adjustments
Debits and credits for transaction(s) using your card may not appear in your account on or effective the same day as the purchase or return/adjustment.
Your deposit transactions
You agree to only deposit cheques and other instruments where the name of the payee matches the name of the account holder or, if the account is a joint account, the name of one of the account holders.
If the cheque or instrument is payable to more than one payee, the names of all payees must match the names of all account holders.
Your foreign currency transactions
If you withdraw or deposit foreign currency from or to your Canadian dollar account through a CIBC bank machine, we will debit or credit your account in Canadian funds at the exchange rate set by us. Exchange rates will be set by us on a date determined by us, which date may be different from the date you made the withdrawal or deposit.
For debit purchases (and credits/returns) made with merchants outside Canada, card not present transactions in foreign currency or foreign currency withdrawals through bank machines outside Canada, depending on which currency is being converted, the amount of the withdrawal, purchase, return or credit, including any surcharge imposed by a third party for using the bank machine, network or other service, is converted to the currency of your account at an exchange rate, either:
(i) listed at simplii.com/debitcard as the rate in effect on the date of conversion for the applicable currency; or
(ii) which CIBC is required to pay on the date of conversion, plus an administrative fee of 2.5% of the converted amount, for any currencies which are not subject to the exchange rate noted in (i) above.
You acknowledge that currency conversion may not happen on the date of your transaction or withdrawal. Other applicable fees are indicated in the “costs for special requests and additional products and services” section of this agreement.
We may, in our discretion, permit transactions on your account in a different currency than the currency of the account. The transaction amount will be converted to the currency of your account at the exchange rate selected by us and on a date determined by CIBC. This date may be different from the date you performed the transaction. An item transferred or deposited to your account in a different currency than the currency of the account which is returned unpaid for any reason will be converted to the currency of your account at the exchange rate selected by us and on a date determined by CIBC. The converted amount will be charged back to your account. CIBC is not responsible for any losses you may incur due to changes in foreign exchange rates or the unavailability of funds due to foreign currency restrictions. You agree that any claims We may have against you, and any service or other charges related to your account, can be deducted from your account in the same currency as your account.
We earn money on the difference (the spread) between the bid and ask prices of the cost of currency, which is in addition to any fee you pay us on a foreign currency transaction. Any exchange rate selected by us will include a spread to compensate us for providing foreign exchange services to you.
Extended holds, on the Canadian dollar equivalent amount may be placed on foreign currency deposits (cheques and cash).
Your daily withdrawal limit for all accounts, including foreign currency accounts, is in Canadian dollars or the Canadian dollar equivalent.
Responsibility for errors or service interruptions
Our errors: We will be responsible for only the amount of any error we make and nothing else. If you benefit from our error, you will be responsible for the difference between the error and the correct amount; you will not claim for any losses, including lost profit, lost business or any other consequence.
Service interruptions: We may cancel or change any of our services and your ability to access them at any time, without notice to you. We will not be responsible for any inconvenience or loss, which may result. Although we do not expect any service interruptions or other communication malfunctions, we are not responsible for any loss of any kind you may experience as a result, unless we are grossly negligent (in which event we will be liable only for the item or the direct damages you have suffered; we will not be liable for any indirect, special or consequential damages).
Your errors: We are not responsible for any errors that you make during a transaction, including when installing/downloading software for online banking access.
No warranties
Other than the commitments made in the Simplii Financial Personal Banking Online Security Guarantee, we disclaim any warranties and conditions (including any oral, implied or statutory warranties and conditions) regarding the nature, quality or character of online banking, including any warranties and conditions as to merchantability, operation, currency, timeliness, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, security and accuracy.
Termination of agreement and withdrawal of access
We may terminate this agreement with you or withdraw your access to online banking at any time, without notice to you, in which case this agreement will continue to apply in respect of your past access. We will not be liable for any losses or inconvenience that result from our withdrawal of your access.

We appoint you as our agent to act on our behalf in the creation and transmission of images to us. You may not further delegate the role as agent. Qualification requirements may apply to the mobile deposit service and we reserve the right to change the qualifications at any time without prior notice.
Hardware and software
In order to use the mobile deposit service, you must obtain and maintain, at your expense, compatible hardware and software as specified by us from time to time. We are not responsible for any third party hardware or software you may need to use the mobile deposit service. Any such hardware or software is accepted by you as is and is subject to the terms and conditions of use you enter into directly with the third party provider at time of download and/or installation.
Eligible items
You may image and deposit any of these original Canadian currency paper items issued by a financial institution located in Canada: cheques, bank money orders, bank drafts, convenience cheques and certified cheques. You agree you will not image and deposit any of the following:
Items payable to any person or entity other than the person or entity that owns the account that the item is being deposited into.
Items which have been altered on the front, or which you know or suspect, or should know or suspect, are fraudulent.
Items which are known or suspected to be sourced from or for any illegal or improper purposes.
Items payable jointly, unless deposited into an account in the name of all payees.
Items drawn on a financial institution located outside Canada.

Items which are postdated or dated more than 6 months prior to the date of deposit.
Items with any endorsement on the back other than that specified in these terms and conditions.
Items which have been already deposited through the mobile deposit service, a remote deposit capture service offered at any other financial institution, or any other means.
Endorsements and procedures
You agree to endorse any item transmitted through the mobile deposit service by signing your name and writing "For deposit only" on the back of the item or as we may otherwise instruct. Immediately after transmission of an image, you agree to mark the front of the item as "paid" or "void" or cross it with parallel lines to indicate that the item has been imaged and transmitted. You agree to follow any other procedures and instructions for use of the mobile deposit service as we may establish from time to time.
Receipt of items
We reserve the right to reject any item transmitted through the mobile deposit service at our discretion. An item may be returned to us by the paying financial institution because, among other reasons, the paying financial institution determines that the item cannot be processed, is illegible, or is otherwise unacceptable. We are not responsible for items we do not receive or for images that are corrupted or not fully received during transmission. We may charge back to your account at any time, any item that we subsequently determine was not eligible for deposit. If the deposit amount does not match the amount of the image, we may adjust your account to reflect the amount on the image received. You agree that we are not liable for any loss, costs, or fees you may incur as a result of our charge back or adjustment.
Availability of funds
The day of deposit will be considered to be the day we receive the image in the province where your account is located. Funds will be credited to your account immediately upon receipt of the image but availability and access to the funds will be subject to our hold policy and your access to funds limit.
Transaction and processing times
Deposits made up to and including 12:00 a.m. EST (midnight) will have a current day transaction date. Deposits made on national holidays, Saturdays and Sundays will have a next business day transaction date.
Destruction and replacement of transmitted items
You agree to retain the item for at least 5 calendar days from the date of deposit and destroy it within 120 calendar days of deposit by shredding, pulping, burning, crushing, erasing or any other means that ensures that the item cannot be reused.
During the time you retain the item, you agree to promptly provide the item to us upon request. You are responsible for any and all costs associated with obtaining a replacement negotiable item in the event that we request you re-transmit an image, and the original item was destroyed or otherwise lost. If you do not comply with such a request, then we can place a hold on or reverse any credit made to your account in relation to the item, even if this creates an overdraft on your account.
Deposit limits
We may establish limits on the dollar amount of items and/or number of items which can be deposited. These limits may change from time to time without prior notice to you. If you attempt to make a deposit in excess of these limits, we may reject your deposit. If we permit you to make a deposit in excess of these limits, such deposit will still be subject to these terms and conditions, and we will not be obligated to allow such a deposit at other times.
Presentment
The manner in which the items are cleared, presented (or represented) for payment, and collected is determined in our sole discretion.
Errors in transmission
By using the mobile deposit service, you accept the risk that an item may be intercepted or misdirected during transmission. We have no liability to you or others for any such intercepted or misdirected item or information disclosed through such errors.
Image quality
The image transmitted to us using the mobile deposit service must be legible, as determined in our sole discretion and include, among other things, clearly legible and unaltered magnetic ink character recognition (“MICR”) information. The image quality of items must also comply with the requirements established from time to time by us, the Canadian Payments Association, or any other regulatory agency or association. You agree that we shall not be liable for any damages resulting from an item’s poor image quality, including those related to rejection of or the delayed or improper crediting of such an item, or from any inaccurate information you supply regarding the item.
Your promises to us and indemnification
You warrant to us that:
You will only transmit eligible items.
You have not already deposited or cashed the item.
You will not re-deposit or re-present the original item.
You will comply with these terms and conditions and all applicable rules, laws and regulations.
You will take all necessary precautions to prevent any other person from purporting to create or transmit an image to the credit of your account.
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us from any losses we may incur (other than due to our own gross negligence or misconduct) for breach of this warranty provision.
Cooperation with investigations
You agree to cooperate with us in the investigation of unusual transactions, poor quality transmissions, and resolution of client claims, including by providing, upon request and without further cost, any originals or copies of items deposited through the mobile deposit service in your possession and your records relating to such items and transmissions.
Limitation of liability
Except as provided in this agreement or as required by applicable law, we will not be liable to you for any losses arising from the mobile deposit service which include, but are not limited to: (a) a delay in processing a deposit; (b) requiring you to obtain another negotiable item; (c) technical difficulties or interruptions in service; or (d) your use or inability to use this service, regardless of the cause of action, including negligence, even if we are advised of the possibility of such damages.
Managing your accounts/services
If you hold an account or any other service jointly with another person, these terms apply:
"You" and "your" mean each person who holds your account.
For each jointly held account or other service, you are individually and jointly responsible for any and all outstanding unpaid amounts on your account. This means that we will be entitled to recover from either one of you (or if one of you dies, from your estate) the full amount outstanding.
Each of you can make transactions on your account (whether by cheque, personal computer, telephone, pre-authorized debit, bank machine or any other means of accessing your account) without the signature, authorization or consent of the other(s), and in most cases, we will complete all transactions based on one authorized signature.
You authorize us to deposit to your account, any cheques or other negotiable instruments that are payable to, or for the credit of, either one of you, even if they are not endorsed by either one of you.
You agree that requested paper account statements, notices and other correspondence for each jointly held bank, savings or GIC account, and notices and other correspondence for jointly held lines of credit, shall be sent to the person designated as the primary account holder.
You authorize us to communicate with any one of you in respect of matters relating to the joint account and any one of you may provide any instructions regarding the operation of the joint account including, but not limited to, changing the joint account address in our records, renewal and redemption of GICs, and disposition of funds.
You acknowledge that each joint account holder may be provided account information, including transactions and account related information, of other joint account holders. This includes information about the account prior to it becoming a joint account.
If one joint bank account holder is declared mentally incompetent or incapable of managing their affairs, all of you agree that the legally appointed representative of the incapacitated joint bank account holder has the same right of access to the joint account as did the incapacitated joint account holder. We may rely on a legally appointed representative who is acting for any one joint bank account holder.
All money that is now or may later be credited to your bank or GIC account (including any interest) is your joint property with the right of survivorship. This means that upon the death of a joint bank or GIC account holder, the balance of the bank or GIC account belongs to the survivor(s). To make this effective, you hereby assign the balance of any jointly held bank or GIC account to the surviving account holder(s) in the event of your death. After your death, in the event your estate representative or anyone other than the survivor(s) (any and all referred to as your estate) has or makes a claim against the assets in the joint account, we will have no obligation to your estate and your estate must deal with the survivor(s). We are not required to act in accordance with any trust intended or granted by you with respect to the account or any monies in it, even if we are aware of such trust, and this is binding on your estate and any beneficiary of such trust. (This provision will not apply if any one of the account holders is domiciled in Quebec at the time of their death.)
Overdraft protection on your bank account
Overdraft protection is an optional service available as a supplement to your bank account that allows you to temporarily overdraw your bank account. These terms and conditions for overdraft protection apply in addition to the terms and conditions applicable to your bank account. Overdraft protection is only available on select bank accounts, which includes the No Fee Chequing Account.
Using your overdraft protection
If you request it, your overdraft protection is available after we have approved you and received all documentation necessary for its activation.
Overdraft protection will continue until either of us cancel it in accordance with the “Cancellation of overdraft protection” section below.
You agree not to exceed the overdraft limit set for your bank account(s). If there is no overdraft limit on your bank account(s), we may, if we wish, allow your account to be overdrawn. We will have no obligation to process withdrawals (debits of any kind) that result in your bank account(s) being overdrawn, that exceed the overdraft limit, or that would further exceed the overdraft limit, even if we have done so in the past.
You will be charged an overdraft protection fee if your bank account is overdrawn on any day in a given month, based on your account activity and the final daily balance of the account. The overdraft protection fee will only be charged once in any month in which you use overdraft protection, for your first use of the overdraft protection service. We will not charge a further fee if the overdraft protection service is used again in the same month. The overdraft protection fee will be posted to your bank account at the end of the month.
If you no longer want overdraft protection on your bank account, you can cancel your overdraft protection, effective immediately, at any time as outlined in the cancellation section below.
Interest on overdue amounts
Interest rate: You will be charged interest on any overdraft amounts at a fixed annual rate equal to the percentage rate we disclosed to you in your welcome kit or otherwise in writing. See the “costs for special requests and additional products and services” section of this page for details.
How we calculate and charge interest: Interest is calculated on the final daily overdraft balance throughout the month and will be charged monthly to your bank account. Even in a leap year, interest is calculated by multiplying the overdraft balance by the overdraft interest rate, dividing the product by 365 and multiplying the result by the number of days in the month during which such interest rate was chargeable.
Repayment of overdue amounts
You agree to bring your account into a positive balance for one full business day (24 hours) once per calendar month. If your bank account becomes overdrawn, or you exceed your overdraft limit, you must repay that excess amount immediately. We will apply deposits first to any overdraft or overlimit amounts on your bank account.
You agree to pay all amounts owing immediately if and when we ask.
Cancellation of overdraft protection
We may at any time cancel your overdraft protection and refuse to process any further withdrawals, including those that you issued before we cancelled your overdraft protection.
In order for you to cancel your overdraft protection, any overdraft amount owing must be paid in full. If your overdraft balance is $0, you can remove the overdraft protection by giving us a call and your overdraft protection will be cancelled, effective immediately. While we process your request to cancel, your overdraft balance must remain $0.
The interest rate in effect at the date of cancellation will still apply after your overdraft protection is cancelled and after any judgments that we obtain against you. Any outstanding interest will be deducted from your account at the end of the current month.
General terms
Your notices and statements
Each statement for your bank account and your line of credit will be provided electronically or by mail each month, unless (in the case of a line of credit) there is no balance and no account activity in the month. Any items not processed by the time the statement is issued will be reflected on the next scheduled statement.
If you have elected to receive paper statements, and or notices, we will send paper statements and notices by regular mail to the current mailing address we have in our records. Five business days after they have been sent, you will be deemed to have received them.
Notices for jointly held accounts will be sent to the primary account holder.
If requested, Security Alerts will be sent to the email address you provide to us as your primary email address for online banking. You can change your email address online through online banking or telephone banking.
Balance alerts for Eligible Deposit Accounts
If you provide the necessary contact information to us (e-mail address, Canadian mobile number or registration for online banking or mobile banking), and haven’t opted out, then for each Eligible Deposit Account you open, we will send you an electronic alert when the Available Balance falls below an amount set by you, or $100 by default if you do not set an amount. This means that for Eligible Deposit Accounts denominated in dollars, the default alert amount is $100 in the currency of the account. For Eligible Deposit Accounts not denominated in dollars, the default alert amount is the foreign currency equivalent of Canadian $100 (which amount is an approximation based on the exchange rate and conversion date determined by CIBC). You may opt out of these alerts by following the instructions in the alert message (or otherwise provided by us), or through online banking or mobile banking. You may change alert preferences through online banking, mobile banking or contacting us by telephone. Due to their nature, alerts may be intercepted, reviewed or altered by others with access to your Eligible Deposit Account or device(s). We will not be liable for any losses arising out of your use of or inability to use the alerts, or if alerts are delayed or not delivered due to factors beyond our reasonable control except as may be required by applicable law.
The above information only relates to Eligible Deposit Accounts. For information about balance alerts sent for Simplii Financial credit card and line of credit accounts, please refer to the Simplii Financial Summary of Rates and Fees and the Simplii Financial Statement of Disclosure respectively.
Inactive (dormant accounts)
A chequing account will be considered inactive (dormant) if you have not initiated any transactions for a 1-year period. A savings account will be considered inactive (dormant) if you have not initiated any transactions for a 2-year period. There may be restrictions on your use of inactive (dormant) accounts.
Your records
Your information, including recorded or electronic records and communications, may be recorded and stored on any media and in a format that we consider appropriate. These records, along with any bank machine transactions records, will be binding, conclusive, and admissible in any legal proceedings as the best evidence.
Processing and verifying transactions and our hold funds policy
A transaction may not be accepted until we have taken such steps as we deem necessary to verify its details and authenticity.
A hold may be placed on your account for the total amount of any deposits as follows:
For Canadian dollar deposits, no more than 5 business days after the day of the deposit.
For US dollar cheques drawn on Canadian or US banks, up to 30 business days.
For cheques in currencies other than Canadian or US dollars drawn on a Canadian or US bank, up to 30 business days.
For cheques in other currencies drawn on foreign banks for which we have an exchange rate, up to 60 business days.
Some foreign currency items may be required to be sent for collection to another financial institution. Funds will be deposited to your account only when received from another financial institution.
A hold may also be placed on your account for the total amount of bank-to-bank transfers for no more than 5 business days.
Despite these hold periods, you understand that we do not and cannot confirm when an item will clear, or whether an item has cleared. Items may be returned at any time, and you are solely responsible for returned items.
We may extend the maximum hold period in the following circumstances, including (but not limited to) where:
We have reasonable grounds to believe there may be illegal, fraudulent or improper activity in relation to an account; or
The deposited cheque is not encoded with magnetic ink character recognition or is not readable by operational systems (for example, if damaged or mutilated); or
An account has been open for less than 90 days; or
A cheque or other instrument has been endorsed more than once; or
A cheque or instrument has been deposited at least six months after the date of the cheque.
The extended hold period under these circumstances is estimated to be 30 business days. The extended hold period is an estimate, in some cases, it may be longer; or it may be extended as a result of the exceptional circumstances described above.
Your responsibility for unpaid items
You are responsible for any deposits to your account if they are unpaid. We may charge these items back to your account and if necessary we may debit any of your other accounts without taking any further action.
NSF items (i.e. cheques, transfers, pre-authorized payments, post-dated bill payments)
When there is not enough money in your account and you have not arranged the appropriate credit, then the cheque or other item will be returned unpaid and an NSF charge will be applied to your account. The merchant may present the same payment item multiple times which can result in additional NSF fees being charged to your account.
Charges and right to offset
You authorize us to review and, if required, debit your account(s) or any of your funds on deposit with us or any member of the CIBC group of companies, regardless of whether the account(s) or funds are held individually or jointly, with our charges (interest and non-interest) or for any other money that is owed for your financial products or services. These charges may be changed from time to time and will be disclosed to you in accordance with applicable laws. You authorize us to review and debit your individual or joint account for any other money that is owed by you to us or any member of the CIBC group of companies.
Lost or stolen cheques
You agree to inform us immediately if any cheques are lost or stolen. If you do not, you will be responsible for any improper use of the cheques.
Certified cheques
We cannot certify cheques; however, you may obtain money orders, bank drafts and wire transfers instead.
Approved cheques
You agree to use only the types of cheques and drafts approved by us.
Stop payments
You can place a stop payment on any cheque or other pre-authorized payment order, if it has not already been paid, by giving us the required details and paying the charge as indicated in the “costs for special requests and additional products and services” section of this page.
We will do our best to stop payment; however, the cheque/order must match exactly the details you have provided. If it does not, we are not responsible if the cheque/order is paid. If payment occurs for any other reason, we will reimburse you unless the cheque/order is paid for a legitimate debt.
Your stop payment request will be logged into our system within a reasonable time after it has been received.
Interest rates on your bank, savings, TFSA and RRSP accounts
Interest rates are expressed annually and may vary from time to time. You acknowledge that, from time to time, we may change interest rates and how we calculate interest.
Obtain current rates by visiting simplii.com or giving us a call.
Changes to your terms and conditions
All accounts other than the line of credit and the loan:
We may propose to change, either permanently or temporarily, any terms and conditions (including fees, charges, other amounts required to be paid by you, if any, in respect of your account) or replace these terms and conditions with another agreement, at any time. We will give you advance written notice of a proposed change as required by applicable law, in accordance with this section. You may refuse the change by terminating these terms and conditions and closing your account before the change is stated to come into effect in the notice.
The line of credit and the loan:
We may permanently or temporarily change any terms and conditions applicable to your line of credit or loan (including changes to your credit limit, interest rate, term, regular payments, payment frequency, amortization period, fees and other charges), or replace these terms and conditions with another agreement, at any time. If we provide you with notice or if we are required by law to provide you with prior notice, we will do so in accordance with this section. You will be considered to accept any changes made to these terms and conditions if there are any outstanding unpaid amounts under the line of credit or loan, as applicable, after the effective date of the change. Changes to any terms of your line of credit or loan will apply to all amounts owing on or arising under your line of credit or loan, as applicable.
We will notify you of changes to these terms and conditions by any method allowed by applicable law, including:
Placing a notice on your statement
Sending you a notice (written or electronic)
Posting a notice on the
Simplii homepage
The method may depend on the type of change being made.
You can obtain a copy of the current terms and conditions by visiting simplii.com or giving us a call.
Payment into court
If there is a dispute or uncertainty about who is entitled to or to instruct on your account due to your alleged or actual incapacity or any marriage/common-law partnership breakdown, or who is legally entitled to apply for and accept payment on your death, we are entitled to either apply to the court for directions or pay the account proceeds or portion thereof into court and be fully discharged. In either case, we can recover any legal and other costs we incur in this regard from the account.
Set-off debts against account
We may apply monies in any of your accounts against any debt or liability any of you may owe to us no matter how long it has been owed. We may do so in any manner we consider necessary without first giving you notice and regardless of whether the accounts are individual or joint accounts. This right operates despite any demands that may have been made by a third party. You acknowledge that in the event we receive notice of the bankruptcy, insolvency or similar arrangement of any of you, we can immediately exercise this right of set-off without prior notice to you. This right is in addition to any rights which we may have at law or in equity in respect to set-off or consolidation of accounts.
Closing or freezing your accounts
We can close or freeze your account(s) at our discretion, including if there are concerns of illegal, fraudulent, or improper activity in relation to the account.
If there are no deposits within 120 days of opening, or if there is no money in your bank account, savings account, GIC account, TFSA or RRSP, and there are no transactions for four months, we have the option, where applicable, of closing your accounts.
You are responsible for all transactions on your account(s), even if it has been closed.
If your bank account is closed for any reason, we will return the remaining balance to you, less any amounts that you owe to us, as follows:
If the account is a Canadian dollar account, we will issue a bank draft or money order in Canadian dollars or, at your request, transfer funds to another Simplii Financial bank account which is open and in good standing.
If the account is a US dollar account, we will issue a US dollar bank draft or money order or, at your request, transfer funds to another Simplii Financial bank account which is open and in good standing. If the account receiving funds is in a different currency, the funds will be converted at the exchange rate and on a date determined by CIBC.
If the account is in any other foreign currency, we will convert the balance of the account to Canadian dollars and either issue a bank draft or money order in Canadian dollars or, at your request, transfer funds to another Simplii Financial bank account which is open and good standing. The balance will be converted at the exchange rate and on a date determined by CIBC.
In the event of your death
Your legal representative needs to inform us as soon as possible of your death so that any balances can be transferred to your estate. If this does not happen, we are not responsible for any improper transaction that may occur. On request of the estate representative of a deceased account holder, we will provide the estate representative with any documents and other information about the account that the deceased account holder would have been entitled to while alive, up to and including the date of death, as long as the estate representative has rights to the account. This includes, among other things, account forms, correspondence, transactions, statements, vouchers and balances.
Governing law
These terms and conditions are subject to the laws of Canada and the applicable laws of the Canadian province or territory of the primary address of residence that you have given us (and the courts in that province/territory will have jurisdiction over all disputes between you and us). If you have given us a primary address of residence in a province or jurisdiction in which accounts are not offered, these terms and conditions are subject to the laws of Canada and the applicable laws of Ontario (and the courts in that province will have jurisdiction over all disputes between you and us).
We have the right to comply with any third party demand (such as Requirements to Pay issued under federal or provincial legislation) or court order that we receive in respect of your accounts, including holding funds in those accounts to satisfy any demand or court order, regardless of the province or territory where such demand or court order is issued.
You agree that we will not be liable to you in any way for complying with, or otherwise acting upon any third party demand or court order issued on your accounts. You agree that if we comply with a third party demand, we may charge our reasonable costs to do so against your account.
Severability
If any term of this agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining terms shall remain in full force and effect.
Accessing website from other jurisdictions
You acknowledge and agree that while you may access the Simplii Financial website from other jurisdictions outside of Canada, some aspects of the services or some information on the website may not be available to you in those jurisdictions. We are only offering to you services that are legally permitted in the jurisdictions from which you access the website or the services, whether through mobile banking or otherwise. If you access or use the services or the website outside of Canada, you do so at your own risk, and you bear all responsibility for compliance with any local, provincial, national or international laws that are applicable to such access or use of the services or the website by you.
Moving out of Canada
If you move out of Canada, you agree:
To pay us all that you owe us without any deductions for any taxes and withholdings that your new country may impose.
To close all of your product holdings with us prior to moving.
Changing your tax residency
As required by Canadian law, you declare that you are a Canadian resident for tax purposes and the residency information and United States person status you provided to us, including any tax identification number, are correct and complete. If your tax residency information or United States person status changes, you must provide us with updated information within 30 days. Failure to provide satisfactory self-certification of tax residency or United States person status may result in your account information being reported to the relevant tax authority and you may be subject to penalty under the Income Tax Act (Canada).
Banking centres
Although CIBC provides Simplii Financial products and services, you cannot access your Simplii Financial accounts or other services through any CIBC banking centre.

Terms and conditions specific to wire transfers
Terms with special meaning
“Beneficiary” means the person you have identified as the recipient of your wire transfer.
“Charges” means all charges that we incur in carrying out your instructions, and includes among other things all taxes (other than income taxes), duties and charges levied or collected by any correspondent.
“Correspondent” means each person receiving or handling funds for us, and includes each person any correspondent engages to carry out your instructions.
“Person” includes individuals, partnerships, companies and corporations.
General terms
We will act as a principal, not as your agent, to transfer the funds you have requested to the beneficiary. We may at our own discretion use one or more correspondents and fund transfer systems, in accordance with applicable laws, to carry out your instructions.
We will not be responsible for any delay, error or loss that may occur in connection with the transfer, including any delay, error or loss from or by any correspondent, unless these terms and conditions provide otherwise.
We will not be responsible for any delay, error or loss which is beyond our control or, any error or inconsistency in the information that you provide relating to the requested transfer. Neither we nor any correspondent will be responsible for verifying the information you have provided. We, any correspondent, and the beneficiary’s bank will rely on any account number you have provided even if the account is not in the beneficiary’s name. If you instruct us to credit a specific account, you will confirm that you are authorized by the account holder(s) to credit that account.
You will prepay the amount of your wire transfer instructions. You agree to pay any associated costs, whether or not the requested transfer can be completed. Unless you designate the transfer as “free and clear of all charges”, then we and any correspondents will be authorized to deduct unpaid fees and charges before crediting the beneficiary.
You will indemnify us and any correspondents for any claims or expenses made or incurred as a result of complying with your wire transfer instructions.
If we or the correspondent are unable to credit the beneficiary in the funds of a specific currency that you requested in your instructions, you authorize us to make payment to the beneficiary in local currency, at the rate of exchange in effect at that time. You agree to accept any risk of currency fluctuation in that event.
If we are unable to carry out your instructions within a reasonable time, we will refund to the account the amount you have prepaid, less any fees, charges or other unpaid amount, but only if and to the extent that we have in the meantime been reimbursed by any correspondent for funds forwarded by us. The amount deposited to your account will be in the currency of the account and, if applicable, such amount will be converted to the currency of your account at the exchange rate and on a date determined by CIBC. This date may be different from the date you performed the transaction. We may earn money on the difference between the bid and ask prices of the cost of the currency, which is in addition to any fee you pay us on the foreign currency transaction or any fees you pay us for your account. CIBC is not responsible for any losses you may incur due to changes in foreign exchange rates or the unavailability of funds due to foreign currency restrictions.
Terms and conditions specific to GICs
General:
All of our GICs are issued by CIBC and are not transferable, assignable or negotiable by the registered holder(s) without our consent.
For RRSP GICs, additional contributions cannot be made to the same RRSP GIC; a new RRSP GIC must be opened. Multiple RRSP GICs can be held within each RSP Plan Type.
A newly purchased GIC cannot be redeemed or cancelled prior to maturity.
When you purchase a GIC, you will receive the interest rate and the annual percentage yield (APY) applicable to the GIC. The interest rate is guaranteed and fixed for the duration of the investment term. For non-registered GICs, interest is calculated daily based on the simple annual interest rate provided to you and is paid or compounded monthly (depending on the interest option chosen). For RRSP GICs, interest is calculated daily (based on the simple annual interest rate), compounded monthly and paid at maturity. APY is the effective interest rate of the GIC. It illustrates the effect of compounding, or the earning of interest on interest. The APY is dependent on the interest rate of the GIC.
Principal and interest will be repaid according to the instructions you provide to us. Please call us to discuss your repayment options. For non-registered GICs repayment options include: depositing your GIC funds into your Simplii Financial deposit account or, if you do not have a Simplii Financial deposit account, issuing you a bank draft. For RRSP GICs repayment options include: depositing your RRSP funds into a Simplii Financial RRSP savings account, issuing you a bank draft (subject to withholding tax as required by applicable law) or transferring your RRSP funds to an RRSP at another financial institution.
If you have questions about your GIC, please give us a call.
Renewal terms:
If you have elected to have your non-registered GIC renew automatically at maturity, or no maturity instructions have been received, your GIC will automatically be renewed at maturity without further agreement into the same GIC type for the same term at the prevailing posted fixed rate of interest. If the same type of GIC is not available, we will renew the GIC into a GIC which we consider to be comparable, in our sole opinion. In either case, the new terms and conditions will be set out on the renewal confirmation. On renewal, we may change the GIC’s terms and conditions in accordance with applicable law. For RRSP GICs, your GIC (including principal and accrued interest) will automatically renew at maturity without further agreement in accordance with the above terms.
For RRSP GICs, if you will reach 71 years of age (or such other age as specified by applicable law for RRSPs) before your GIC matures, we may reduce the term length so that the renewed GIC will mature before you turn that age, in accordance with applicable law.
If you have elected to open a laddered GIC, at maturity, each GIC will automatically be reinvested for a 5-year term at the prevailing fixed rate of interest.
After each renewal, a renewal confirmation will be provided to you electronically at simplii.com or sent to the mailing or email address currently on our records. If there is more than one registered holder, notices sent to one mailing or email address will bind all registered holders. If you do not wish to receive your renewal confirmation at simplii.com or by email, sign on to online banking and select the chat feature, or give us a call.
If your renewed GIC does not meet your investment needs, you have the option to cancel the GIC within 10 business days after the day it is renewed and we will repay you the original principal amount invested and any accrued interest up to the date of maturity that has not been previously paid to you. To cancel your renewed GIC, call 1-888-723-8881.
Powers of Attorney and joint bank accounts: important information
Many clients are concerned about how to manage their money, property, and finances as they age or as life changes take place. It is a good idea to plan ahead for a time when you may need help managing your affairs if you are unable to carry out these tasks.
Two tools often used for managing financial affairs in situations like these are Powers of Attorney and joint bank accounts.
There are risks and advantages to both, so it’s important to know how these things work before you use them.
Power of attorney
A Power of Attorney (POA) is a legal document you make that gives someone the authority to manage your affairs on your behalf. This person is called your “attorney” but does not need to be a lawyer.
On certain Simplii Financial accounts you can set up a POA and your attorney will be able to carry out certain banking-related transactions with us. You can use our POA form, but it is not mandatory to use it. You can also use a POA form prepared by a lawyer or other third party. You may change or cancel your POA at any time as long as you are mentally capable. Whatever form of POA you use, seeking advice of a legal professional may be beneficial, especially if you have an existing POA, to ensure there are no conflicts with it and our POA form, if you choose to use it.
Before your attorney can operate your account on your behalf, you or your attorney must give us a call at
1-888-723-8881.
Opens your phone app.
We’ll ask you for some information about your attorney, including his or her home phone number, address, occupation and date of birth. If you would like to use our POA form, we’ll mail one to you and ask you to complete and return it. If you would like to use your own POA document, we’ll ask you to mail us an original or notarized copy. Finally, your attorney will need to have their identity verified to complete this request.
On occasion, your attorney’s instructions or the POA document itself may require further review. In these cases, except where prohibited by law, we will inform you or your attorney that a review is required. Certain reviews require more time, but we’ll tell you or your attorney how long we expect the review to take.
If we aren’t able to act on the POA or your attorney’s instructions, you or your attorney may contact us with any concerns. If you remain unsatisfied, see your account Terms and Conditions “How to resolve concerns with Simplii Financial” section in the Simplii Financial Products and Services Agreement for information on how to further escalate your concerns.

Government of Canada’s website

Joint bank accounts
With Simplii Financial, you can open a joint bank account with another person. Joint bank accounts allow both account holders equal access to the account and both are equally responsible for all transactions on the account, including, but not limited to, deposits and withdrawals. We will require only the signature, authorization or consent of one of you to carry out transactions on the account.
Some of the risks associated with operating a joint bank account are as follows:
All money deposited to the account is joint property with the right of survivorship. This means that if one of you dies, all money in your account automatically becomes the property of the other account holder regardless of your estate plan.
Because we will act on the instructions of either account holder, your joint account holder could withdraw money from the account without your permission, even if you made some or all of the deposits.
You and your joint account holder will be both individually and jointly responsible for unpaid amounts on the account. This means that we will be entitled to recover the full outstanding amount from either one of you or, if one of you dies, from your estate.
The money in the account may be subject to claims by the other account holder’s creditors, even if you made some or all of the deposits.
For more details on the terms applicable to Simplii Financial joint accounts refer to the “Managing your accounts/services” section in the Products and Services Agreement.

Privacy
Simplii Financial is a division of CIBC, and its collection, use and sharing of personal information is governed by the CIBC privacy policy, “Your Privacy is Protected”, available on the
CIBC Privacy and Security page

.
You consent to the collection, use and sharing of your information as set out in the CIBC privacy policy. This policy may be updated from time to time. We will post our most up-to-date policy on our website.
For your convenience, the following are some highlights of the CIBC privacy policy:
What is personal information?
Personal information means any information about an identifiable individual.
It can be in any form including paper, electronic, audio, video or biometric such as voiceprints, photographs and signatures. This information can also include information collected through digital activities such as the device model, browser type and IP address.
What information do we collect?
We may collect the following types of information: contact, identity, financial, transactional, and other information that helps us to understand more about you, to be able to serve you better.
Much of the information comes from you but we may also collect information from third parties such as credit bureaus, public records, or government agencies and registries.
We may also collect information by monitoring or recording your interactions with us (e.g. telephone calls, video conferencing, online chats or other interactions with Simplii Financial websites and mobile sites, email, text (SMS), telephone, fax, or other telecommunication channels). We use surveillance, including video recording, in and around our CIBC banking centres, bank machines, and other locations.
How do we use and share information?
We use and share your personal information to provide you with products or services, to communicate with you, to offer you additional products or services including targeted promotions, to personalize your experience with us (including by reviewing and analyzing your information) and to manage our business including our credit and other risks.
Specifically, we may also use and share information within CIBC, with credit bureaus and with other parties in order to protect you and us from error, to prevent and detect criminal activity, and to meet our legal and regulatory obligations.
Depending on your products or services with us, we may share information with our program partners or with your joint account holders.
How do we protect your information?
We take appropriate steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized use, sharing, loss, or theft and we audit our security measures and assess that they remain effective and appropriate.
Our employees who have access to your information are made aware of the importance of keeping it secure and confidential.
We use contracts and other measures with our service providers to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information and to prevent it from being used for any other purpose other than that for which it was intended.
What are your privacy choices?
You have control on how your personal information is collected, used, or shared. For example, you may:
Subject to legal, business or contractual requirements, withdraw your consent to our collection, use or sharing of information at any time upon giving us reasonable notice. However, withdrawing your consent may limit or prevent us from providing you with, or being able to continue to provide you with, specific products and services. For example, if you choose not to provide us with your Social Insurance Number (SIN), we will not be able to provide you with any product where the collection of SIN is required under tax law (e.g., a registered product like an RRSP — Registered Retirement Savings Plan).
Request that we do not use your Social Insurance Number (SIN) to assist in accurately identifying you when conducting credit bureau inquiries. This by itself will not prevent you from qualifying for products and services.
Withdraw your consent to receive certain marketing communications for products and services.
Upon request and subject to certain exceptions, we will provide you with access to any personal information we hold about you.
Contact us through any one of the options listed under the “Need to contact us?” section to exercise your privacy choices or request access to your information.

The CCAO is part of CIBC. Its mandate is to review your complaint and provide a response that’s objective and unbiased to resolve matters with you. The CCAO is not an independent dispute resolution service. However, in an effort to be impartial, they do not report directly to any business area at CIBC or Simplii Financial. It can take the CCAO 3 to 5 weeks to complete an investigation depending on the nature and complexity of your complaint. Any statutory limitation periods that apply to your case will continue to run while the CCAO reviews your complaint, which may impact your ability to begin a civil action.

Independent consumer support agencies
In addition to our service commitment to you, there are a number of external agencies that monitor Canada’s financial industry to ensure compliance and reliable access to financial services. You can raise your complaint to these agencies.
Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments (OBSI)
OBSI is independent from CIBC and Simplii Financial. You have the right to ask OBSI to review your complaint about banking products and services or investments. After the CCAO investigation, you have up to six months after the date of CIBC’s or Simplii’s response to you to contact OBSI. OBSI reserves the right to decline requests for investigations after six months have passed since we responded to your complaint.
Where appropriate, OBSI may ask the CCAO to help them find the earliest possible resolution of your complaint. You can reach the OBSI by:

For example, financial institutions must give consumers information about their fees, interest rates and complaint handling procedures.

Online Security
Simplii Financial Personal Banking Online Security Guarantee
The security of our customers' financial information is important to us. That's why we offer the Simplii Financial Personal Banking Online Security Guarantee.
In the unlikely event that someone gains unauthorized access to your Simplii Financial bank accounts through Simplii Financial Online Banking or your transaction is not completed as you instructed, we will reimburse you 100% of the money lost from your bank accounts provided you have met your responsibilities to us.
Help us protect your information
To benefit from the security of the Simplii Financial Personal Banking Online Security Guarantee, you need to do your part to help us protect your information and finances. This means meeting your responsibilities under your agreements with us, including:
Carefully selecting your password and never disclosing it to anyone.
Using up-to-date anti-virus/anti-spyware software and a firewall.
Reviewing your statements and reporting errors within the time periods set out in your account agreement.
Assisting us in any investigation into improper access to your bank accounts.
For full information, refer to the Simplii Financial Products and Services Agreement and the other agreements for your products and services. The guarantee is governed by the terms of these agreements.
We're committed to protecting your privacy and security
One of our most important priorities is to protect the privacy and security of your personal information and your financial transactions you conduct through Simplii Financial online banking. We use multiple layers of protection when you access your online banking, including:
Web browser encryption
All the browsers supported by Simplii Financial online banking offer 128-bit encryption. This provides a high level of protection for transmitting confidential data over the Internet.
Firewalls
We have secure firewalls to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
Monitoring
We monitor activity on Simplii Financial online banking to enhance your security and to protect your financial information
What is 128-bit encryption technology?
Encryption scrambles all information between your personal computer and our computers, protecting the information you provide to us as it travels over the Internet. Your banking information and transactions are kept secure by using one of the best, most commonly used encryption technologies available: 128 bit encryption.
What happens when I sign in and sign out?
For your protection, you have to provide your card number and password when you sign in to any secure area of our web sites. If you are unable to provide the correct password, you will not be granted access.
When you sign in successfully, your web browser will establish a secure connection between your computer and our web server. This allows you to communicate with us and to conduct online transactions safely. To make sure your browser has established a secure connection, look for a lock symbol at the bottom left or right hand corner of your browser. If you hold the cursor over the lock symbol, it will display the level of encryption that is currently being used. For the Simplii Financial web site, this should read 128-SSL. You can also check the address bar of your browser; if the address starts with "https://" rather than the standard "http://", then your session is secure.
To protect you against unauthorized access to your accounts, your session will time out after 15 minutes of inactivity. When this happens, you will have to sign in again to continue your banking.
We recommend that you clear your browser cache after you sign out, or close your browser and re-open it before browsing the Internet.
How does Simplii Financial use my information?
Online surveys
Simplii Financial may randomly present surveys to visitors of our web site. The survey data is collected anonymously and is used to help improve our services. We do not use the survey data for marketing purposes, and you are not required to complete online surveys.
Online offers
Simplii Financial may present product and service offers to you when visiting our web site. You can choose to accept these offers, decline them, or view them at a later time. You are not required to accept online offers.
Online advertising
Simplii Financial sometimes places online ads on web sites that are not affiliated with Simplii Financial. If you select one of these ads, Simplii Financial may track the response rate and the web site activity associated with each ad. The response rate data is collected anonymously, and is used to help us plan future online advertising campaigns.
Web site activity
Simplii Financial monitors web site activity using persistent cookies to better understand the needs of our visitors and to improve our services. For more information on how Simplii Financial tracks web site activity, please see our section about cookies.
Planning calculators and tools
Simplii Financial's web site includes planning and selection tools and calculators. Tools offered as part of our web site may save your data for your future use so you don't have to enter it each time you use the tool; however, Simplii Financial will not use this data. Tools offered before you sign in to online banking do not save data.
Your information is obtained or used only with your consent
We obtain your consent before we:
Obtain a credit report.
Offer you other products and services.
Send you information about products and services by means of direct marketing.
Provided it is legally permitted, share your information in confidence within the Simplii Financial services group.
Obtain, use or disclose to other persons, information about you unless we are obliged to do so by law or to protect our interests.
Use your information in any way we didn't tell you about previously.
Your consent can be express or implied
Express consent can be verbal or written. For example, when you sign a credit application you are giving your written consent for us to obtain a credit report.
You imply consent when we can reasonably conclude you have given consent by some action you've taken, or when you decide not to take action. For example, if we offer a credit card with attached conditions and if you use the credit card, we can conclude that you have consented to the conditions. If we give you an opportunity to tell us you don't want direct marketing material and you don't tell us that you don't want us to send it, we can conclude that you have no objection.
We will rely on your implied consent to use and disclose identifying information about you, such as your name and address.
How do I clear my browser cache?
If you share a computer and Internet connection with someone, that other person could view your confidential financial information by hitting the "Back" button on your web browser after you have used it to bank online. You can keep your private information secure by closing your web browser after your banking session or by clearing your browser's cache. The cache maintains a copy of web pages that have been viewed recently. Refer to your browser's help menu (commonly available by pressing F1) for instructions on how to clear your cache.
How do I set my browser to accept or disable cookies?
Refer to your browser's help menu (commonly available by pressing F1) for instructions on how to accept or disable your cookies.
What is JavaScript and why do I need it?
JavaScript is a small program that enhances web pages and servers. Simplii Financial uses JavaScript to make our web sites easier to use. You must have JavaScript enabled on your browser to use the Simplii Financial web site.
What are cookies and how do you use them?
A cookie is a small file created by a web server on your computer that can be referenced when the website is visited or when a page on the site is visited. Cookies cannot access files or other information stored on your computer. We use 2 types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies.
What is the difference between a session cookie and a persistent cookie?
Session cookies are used during a single website visit and are automatically deleted from your computer when you leave the site. Persistent cookies are used to track website activity over a longer period and remain on your computer until either you choose to delete them or they expire.
Session cookies perform several critical functions on our website. For example, they protect your security while you are using our Online Banking by ensuring that nobody else can view your data while you are signed on. They are also used to ensure that you don't pay the same bill twice during a single banking session. Your web browser must allow session cookies in order for you to use Simplii Financial Online Banking.
Persistent cookies are also used for a number of purposes on our website. They are used for your convenience to save your Simplii Financial Online Banking personal preferences. For example, you must allow persistent cookies if you want your browser to remember your card number, your language preference and your default home page each time you sign on to Online Banking.
We also use persistent cookies to collect analytical information about how visitors use our websites. For example, we may measure website usage, access to online services, and the level of interest in particular products. We use this information to improve our service and provide a better experience for visitors to our websites.
To gather this information, we use persistent cookies that track how a computer uses our websites and whether the computer has been used to sign on to Online Banking. Currently, we don't use cookies to collect information about identifiable individuals or use cookie information to offer products and services to individuals. If this changes in the future, we will update this section.
Another type of persistent cookie, known as a locally shared object, may be created by software applications running on your computer when viewing material, such as Flash enabled videos, on our website.

E-mail fraud alert
Fraudulent e-mails generally ask customers to select a link, leading them to a fraudulent web site that looks like a legitimate financial institution's web site — even duplicating logos and text. Customers are asked to enter personal banking information, which the fraudsters can use to withdraw money, make purchases or open new accounts and credit card accounts in the customer's name. Fraudulent e-mail messages may imply a sense of urgency or immediate risk to bank accounts or credit cards if you fail to answer. Special offers and prizes may also be promoted as incentives.
What to do if you receive this type of e-mail and have not yet responded to it
Do not respond to the e-mail — some phishing sites distribute malicious software; do not click on the links provided in the e-mail — visiting these sites could place your computer at risk

Identity theft
Electronic identity theft is a growing concern in Canada and around the world. If you participate in Internet file sharing or download music or software, your computer is a potential target for thieves who seek to steal your identity by learning your passwords and taking over your online accounts. Your computer is also vulnerable to viruses, adware and spyware - applications that can capture information from your browser, including passwords, or re- direct you to fraudulent web sites. To reduce the risk of identity theft, please ensure your computer uses a good firewall program, plus up-to-date anti- virus and anti-spyware software.
Unintentionally moving money for strangers
Criminals want you to do their banking for them. If they earn your trust, they'll use your account to cash phony cheques, collect funds from other accounts, and move stolen money offshore. They use a variety of schemes to convince you that they're legitimate. Some will even give you money to earn your trust. By accepting and re-directing electronic deposits (such as wire transfers), you could be participating in a money-laundering scheme if those deposits were proceeds of a fraud or other criminal activity.
How to protect yourself
There are various forms of computer viruses existing on the Internet today that are targeting online financial services. It is important for you to protect the privacy of your information by installing the appropriate programs on your personal computer.
Update your computer and software
Install up-to-date anti-virus software on your computer to help guard against computer viruses.
Install a personal firewall and disable file-sharing software to prevent unauthorized access to your computer and its data.
Keep your browsers up-to-date with current versions and security enhancements
Browse securely
When you are using public computers (for example, at libraries and Internet cafes), sign off after your online banking session and close the browser when you leave the computer.
Electronic forms which you submit online should be securely encrypted. If you're not sure if a web site is secure, look for the letters "https://" at the beginning of your web site address in your web browser. The "s" means that the web connection is secure.
Look for the "lock" icon on the bottom bar of your browser. This indicates you are running in secure mode prior to entering any personal information.
Double-check the web address (URL) of your bank site before entering any confidential information (such as your bank card number and password).
Keep an eye out for fraudulent e-mail scams. These are designed to trick you into downloading a virus or jumping to a fake web site where you will disclose personal information.
Do not respond to unsolicited e-mails
We will never ask you to respond via e-mail to any requests for private or personal information including passwords, personal information numbers or sign in information.
Be cautious of e-mails that ask for personal information. If you are unsure of the authenticity of an e-mail do not reply - simply delete it.
Be cautious when selecting a link to an unknown web site or in an unfamiliar e-mail. The link may appear to be taking you to a reputable web site but may actually be taking you to a fraudulent web site.
Carefully select and manage your online user names and passwords
Make it difficult for others to guess your password by ensuring it contains letters and numbers. If you think someone knows one of your passwords, change all your passwords right away.
Memorize your passwords and PIN numbers, and do not disclose them to anyone. When entering your password or PIN at a bank machine or paying by
INTERAC
®
, position yourself to block others from observing you entering your information. Stay alert when you are using a bank machine by yourself.
Never conduct financial transactions on behalf of strangers
Be wary of any offer that sounds too good to refuse.
Be aware that cheques and other funds deposited into your account can be reversed long after the funds have cleared
Never wire funds until the legitimacy of the cheque or electronic deposit is confirmed.
If you suspect a cheque may be fraudulent, contact the issuing bank and verify its authenticity. If you have already deposited the cheque into your Simplii Financial account, call us immediately at
1-888-723-8881
.
Protect your account and card information
Do not give your account or credit card information to anybody, whether in person, over the telephone, or online, unless you are confident that you are sure who you are dealing with. Do not carry your Social Insurance Number card in your wallet unless it is necessary.
Sign credit cards as soon as you receive them. Cancel inactive cards and don't lend your credit cards to anybody.
Shred or tear up junk mail and statements. If you don't want a pre-approved credit card offer, tear it up or shred it. Identity theft often occurs when thieves go through trash looking for these offers. As well, tear up or shred any personal information you are going to throw away, such as receipts that show your Simplii Financial bank statements.
Arrange to have your salary deposited directly into your Simplii Financial account so you can prevent lost or stolen cheques. You can also set up recurring transfers and payments through online banking so your obligations are met automatically.
Report thefts and losses immediately. If your wallet or purse is lost or stolen, contact us immediately at
1-888-723-8881
to block your accounts.
Review all transactions on your account statement to ensure they are genuine. Report suspicious transactions immediately to Simplii Financial services at
1-888-723-8881
.
Review your credit report. At least once each year, contact a credit bureau to check the accuracy of your credit report.
Banking online is a great way to actively monitor your accounts. If you ever have a question about a transaction, remember we† are here to help - just call us at
1-888-723-8881

Coercive tied selling and other prohibited conduct
The Bank Act requires banks to inform clients and the public that we will not impose undue pressure on a person, or coerce a person, for any purpose, including to obtain a product or service from a particular person, as a condition for obtaining another product or service from the bank (coercive tied selling), or take advantage of a person. All of these practices are prohibited conduct and are against the law. To comply with the law, we have created this page to help you understand prohibited conduct, including coercive tied selling.
What is prohibited conduct?
Simply put, prohibited conduct refers to a bank imposing undue pressure on a person, or coercing a person, for any purpose, or taking advantage of a person, in its dealings with customers and the public.
Coercive tied selling is one example of prohibited conduct that involves a bank imposing undue pressure on, or coercing, a person to obtain a product or service from a particular
person — including
the bank or any of its
affiliates — as
a condition for obtaining another product or service from the bank.
Making these practices illegal means you get the product or service you want without being unduly pressured, coerced, or taken advantage of.
The following examples will help you understand prohibited conduct:
You have been a loyal client dealing with the bank for several years. One of our call centre agents tells you that she is behind on her monthly targets and asks you to apply for a new credit card even though you do not need or want one.
You call into telephone banking for a servicing request. The call centre agent offers you a credit card; you decline, saying you don’t need one. The agent proceeds to continue to offer you a credit card. Each time you provide a reason for not needing it, the agent counters your response. You relent and agree to the credit card.
Examples of prohibited conduct involving coercive tied selling:
Your bank’s mortgage specialist tells you that you qualify for a home mortgage. However, you are also told that the bank will approve your mortgage only if you transfer your investments to the bank or its affiliates. You want the mortgage, but you do not want to move your investments.
You are advised that you qualify for a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) loan. However, you are also told that the bank will approve the loan only if you use the money to buy the bank’s mutual funds. You want the loan, but you want to invest the money elsewhere.
All of these practices are against the law. You should not be pressured or coerced to purchase a product or service you neither want nor need. A bank employee should never take advantage of you, your relationship with the bank or your situation to sell you a product or service you do not need or want. If you qualify for a product, a banking representative is not allowed to unduly pressure you into buying an unwanted product or service as a condition of obtaining the product you want.
What is not coercive tied selling?
Most businesses, including Simplii, look for tangible ways to show their interest in your business and appreciation for your loyalty. Sales practices, such as preferential pricing and bundling of products and services, can offer you better prices or more favourable terms and are not examples of prohibited conduct.
Preferential pricing
Preferential pricing means offering customers a better price or rate on all or part of their business. For example, a printer offers a lower price for each business card if you buy a thousand cards instead of a hundred. A shoe store offers a second pair of shoes at half price.
Similarly, a bank may be able to offer you preferential pricing - a higher interest rate on investments or a lower interest rate on loans - if you use more of its products or services.
The following two examples will help you understand preferential pricing in banks.
After approving your application for a home mortgage, your bank's mortgage specialist tells you that this mortgage would be available at a lower interest rate if you transferred your investments to the bank or its affiliates.
After approving your application for an RRSP loan, you are offered a lower interest rate if you use the loan to buy the bank's mutual funds.
The above practices are acceptable. The approval of your mortgage and RRSP loan is not conditional on your taking another bank product or service. Rather you are offered preferential pricing to encourage you to give the bank more business.
Bundling of products and services
Products or services are often combined to give consumers better prices, incentives or more favourable terms than if you bought each product on its own. For example, a fast-food chain advertises a meal combination that includes a hamburger, fries and a drink. The overall price is lower than if you bought the three items separately.
Similarly, banks may offer you bundled financial services or products so that you can take advantage of package prices that are less than the sum of the individual items.
The following example will help you understand the bundling of bank products and services.
You plan to open a bank account that charges you a monthly fee. You are offered a package of services that includes a comparable bank account, a savings account, overdraft protection and a credit card. The total fees for the package are less than if you purchased each part of the package separately.
Bundling products in this way is permitted because you have the choice of buying the items individually or in a package.
Risk management
To ensure the safety of their depositors, creditors and shareholders, banks must carefully manage the risk on the loans and credit cards they approve. The law allows them to impose certain requirements on borrowers as a condition for granting a
loan — but
only to the extent necessary for us to manage their risk.
The following example will help you understand how banks manage such risk.
You apply for an operating loan for your business. To manage the risk associated with the loan, your bank requires your business to have an operating account with the bank as a condition for obtaining the loan.
Requiring your business's operating account to be at the bank is permitted because it allows your bank to assess possible risks associated with your business's cash flow and manage the risk associated with the loan.
What can you expect from us?
You can expect all Simplii employees to comply with the law by not engaging in prohibited conduct, including coercive tied selling. To that end, we provide training programs on acceptable sales practices. We urge you to let us know if you believe that you have experienced any prohibited conduct, including coercive tied selling in any dealings with us.
