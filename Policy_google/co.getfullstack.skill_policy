Privacy Policy
This page is used to inform visitors regarding
        our policies with the collection, use, and
        disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use
        our Service.
Your Consent
If you choose to use our Service, then you agree
        to the collection and use of information in relation to this
        policy. The Personal and Anonymous Information that we collect are
        used for providing and improving the Service.
        We will not use or share your
        information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
        Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
        as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at
        Skill unless otherwise defined in this Privacy
        Policy.
Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, while using our Service,
        we may require you to provide us with certain
        personally identifiable or anonymous information (see the below sections for more details). The
        information that we request will be
        retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.
Personal Information
We collect some amount of personal information at various stages:
Registering account is a required step when you first start the app. You can either register with us or use your social account from Facebook, Google or Vk.
                    When you're registering with us we ask to provide nickname, email and password. When registering via social account we ask only nickname.
                    We also try to get an email from the social account but if it's not setup there we don't complain.
                    Your email is requested mostly for account related matter: if you forgot your password, we send a password-reset email to that address. Occasionally we may send you promotional emails,
                    but you can unsubscribe from it at any time.
When you're out of resort we permanently monitor your GPS location to identify if you enter a resort. At this point we don't record any information.
When we identify that you've entered a resort we start tracking your location. We record all your movements in a resort. Specifically we record all the information
                    that GPS sends us with each location: latitude, longitude, speed, timestamp, course, horizontal accuracy, vertical accuracy. GPS information is enriched with user activity type
                    that we calculate using our algorithms. We recognize 3 activity types: Ride, Rest, Lift. All that information is used in 3 ways:
Part of these locations forms a ski track that you can see on Tracks screen. Track points and related track metadata (duration, max speed, average speed, distance, etc.)
                            are sent to our servers so you can access it later from any device.
Other locations that Skill denotes either to Rest or Lift activity types are recorded too. At the moment we don't use those locations to show your rest or lift routes
                            but we still send that to our servers. We do that to analyze the correctness of the recorded tracks. We are looking for anomalies in these routes to further improve our Track recording algorithms.
Besides routes and tracks we store more generic information on our servers, like the trips you made (theirs start and finish dates) and the resorts you were in if you recorded at least one track there.
We share your locations with your friends that want to track you.
We share your tracks, trips and seasons with other Skill users. Any Skill user can use Search form on Friends screen to find any other Skill user by nickname.
                            However if you don't want your profile to be publicly available you can make it private. Just go to your Profile screen, choose Settings, then Privacy, tap Friends Only.
                            In that case only your friends can access your detailed statistics. Other users can see your basic profile screen with nickname and avatar, nothing else. Also Friends Only profiles
                            are excluded from all global ratings (these are Global Rating and Resort Rating) besides rating among friends.
Your statistics is used to build various ratings. We used the following statistics: max speed, track count, distance. We show your nickname along these statistics. As mentioned earlier
                            Friends Only profiles participate only in Friends rating.
For crash reporting we use
Firebase Crashlytics
. In a case of a crash it captures all the necessary information about the error
                            (such as error message, stacktrace, device model and platform, Skill version, user ID, IP address, date/time when the crash happened, last 50 steps a user did, which might have led to the crash)
                            and sends that to Google Firebase servers we can access further to debug and fix the issue.
Anonymous Data
Anonymous data is captured to collect usage statistics of various Skill functions to analyze and improve the application:
We use
Firebase Analytics
to record various events happening during a user session. These events are like
                "User tapped stop track button", "User visited Rating screen", "User accepted friend request", etc. We don't collect any personal information at this point, just record that a particular event has happened.

        and individuals due to the following reasons:
