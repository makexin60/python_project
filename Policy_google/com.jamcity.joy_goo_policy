Wemade Play uses information provided by the platform provider or collected or recorded while using the service for the purposes of service provision, maintenance, security, updates, and development and provision of new services. Data is also used to provide more relevant customized services (including advertisements) to users.
Wemade Play may display on the service the user nicknames, profiles, and friend information provided by the platform provider and users may change the display of this information at any time by using the application's feature enabling users to change the display on the platform provider and/or social media website.
If users make service-related inquiries via telephone or email, Wemade Play may keep records of communication with users to provide answers to those inquiries. Furthermore, Wemade Play may use user’s emails addresses to provide users with information relevant to service usage. Moreover, Wemade Play may use information collected (excluding information of EEA user’s) or provided to update the service environment or quality for users, and Wemade Play automated system may analyze users' records of service usage and/or payments to provide individual users with valuable features such as targeted advertisements.
If Wemade Play uses collected or provided user data for purposes other than those declared in the Privacy Policy, it will declare these purposes to users in advance and receive prior consent.
Data collected or provided by Wemade Play is processed by Amazon Web Services (AWS region: Frankfurt, Germany and California, USA) with safety measures certified as appropriate in accordance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, and user data may be processed at the other AWS region(Seoul, South Korea) to provide better service or implement the service contract to users.

Wemade Play does not share data with companies or people outside Wemade Play with the following exceptions. This data may be shared in the following cases.

When external processing is required.
Wemade Play
may entrust data processing to its partners or reliable companies in compliance with physical and technical frameworks that follow internal policies (self-regulatory frameworks). In such cases, Wemade Play bears all liability for the companies to which data processing is entrusted.
If required by law.
If Wemade Play deems it necessary to access, use, store, or publish information for the following purposes, Wemade Play will share information with external companies, organizations, or individuals.
-     If data is requested through legal proceedings, regulations, or relevant laws, or by an investigative or regulatory agency with legal power
-     If needed to detect, prevent, or resolve fraud, technical, or security problems
-     If needed to protect users or the public from elements threatening user or public rights, assets, or public safety
Wemade Play may share anonymous data or data that does not allow users to be identified with its partners. Furthermore, if Wemade Play is subject to the acquisition, merger, or sale of assets (collectively referred to as "M&A" below), it may transfer data to the company undertaking the M&A while maintaining the confidentiality of the information, and in such cases, it will notify users before user data is transferred to the company undertaking the M&A.
4. Information Security
Wemade Play information security management system has been certified safe and reliable by the Korean government and works to protect the data in Wemade Play possession from illegal access, modification, release, or deletion. In particular, Wemade Play periodically reviews the privacy lifecycle and continuously makes necessary updates by applying the latest technology to collect, store, and use personal data to ensure users can safely access the system. This includes using SSL (secure socket layer) and taking physical and technical protective measures to detect unauthorized access to the service system. Furthermore, access authority is limited to the minimum number of employees necessary according to internal policies (self-regulatory frameworks).
5. Updating and Deleting Information
Updating information provided by the platform provider.
Users may request updates of their own data from the platform provider at any time while using the service. Users who are nationals of EU member nations may additionally request access, rectification, adaptation or alteration, transfer or movement of their data, and may restrict or oppose processing or profiling (collectively referred to as "processing", below).
Wemade Play has no authority to process data provided to the platform provider by the user. Therefore, if users request the processing of their own data provided to Wemade Play by the platform provider, Wemade Play will inform users that it has no authority to process user data and instruct them to request data processing from the platform provider and/or social media provider
Updating information collected while using the service.
Users may request updating or processing of their own data from Wemade Play while using the service (restricted to nationals of EU member nations) and, unless data must be kept for reasonable business purposes or legal purposes, Wemade Play will attempt to fulfill this processing request without delay. Furthermore, this requested user data processing will be provided free of charge so long as it does not require excessive effort to comply, and Wemade Play may request verification of user identity before updating or processing the data.
However, the user request may be denied if it is unreasonably repeated, if it requires excessive technical effort to comply (e.g. if a new system must be developed or existing practices must be fundamentally changed), if the request impinges upon others' rights or freedoms, or if the request is extremely impractical. In such cases, the user may object or file a civil complaint with the privacy protection agency in the user's country of residence in accordance with Wemade Play CS procedure for rejection of processing.
Information Delete:
Users may directly request the company to delete the personal information that was collected.

However, to protect user data from accidental or malicious deletion and for maintenance and management of the service, copies of user data may not be immediately deleted from service servers even after a user deletes his or her data from the service. Furthermore, data may not be deleted from backup systems for a certain period of time to comply with laws in the user's country of residence and/or the country of Wemade Play business jurisdiction. In such cases, this data will be deleted without delay once the storage period required by relevant laws has elapsed.
6. Cooperation with Regulations and Regulatory Agencies
Wemade Play periodically reviews compliance with its Privacy Policy in accordance with internal policies (self-regulatory frameworks) and strives to protect user data by applying the latest technology. It complies with several regulatory frameworks including EU and American privacy shield frameworks.
Should a complaint be raised through Wemade Play user CS procedure, the user will be contacted and further steps are taken.

Your Inquiry
Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.
A quick summary of how your inquiry will be handled:
As you’re likely aware, the purpose of this form is to help make it easier for you to get in touch with non-EU and/or non-UK organizations that process your personal data. Given that, any data you submit on this form will be transferred to the foreign organization that you identify in the “Name of the organization that your inquiry relates to” field, above, with the aim of helping resolve your concern. Note that you likely won’t hear any response to your inquiry from VeraSafe directly. Unless the foreign organization specifically authorizes us to respond to you directly, the foreign organization will be fully responsible for handling your inquiry on their own, without any involvement from VeraSafe. In our role as a representative working on behalf of foreign organizations, we can facilitate communication between you and the foreign organization but we don’t have any way to resolve your inquiry ourselves. We want to help you, but we have no power to force any foreign organization to respond to your inquiry, even if we (you and us) both think they should.
Since VeraSafe has a legal obligation to relay your inquiry to the foreign organization you identify above, your rights to request that we not use your data for this purpose are quite limited. Likewise, please be aware that we have a legal obligation to document how we handle your inquiries, which may prevent us from erasing your personal data upon your request. If you do not want VeraSafe to process your personal data, you must not submit such personal data to us in any way. You can always direct your concern to the foreign organization directly (instead of VeraSafe), and you have no obligation to send your inquiry to VeraSafe.
Examples of inquiries that are not likely to be accepted using this form:
Customer service issues
Inquiries that don’t provide enough information or context
Complaints that involve any threats, abusive language, or delivering legal notices
Requests for legal advice
Issues un-related to data protection
Inquiries directed to organizations that have not appointed any VeraSafe entity or affiliate as their Data Protection Representative
Examples of inquiries that are likely to be accepted using this form:
Substantive privacy concerns
Inquiries from regulatory agencies
Requests to exercise privacy rights
