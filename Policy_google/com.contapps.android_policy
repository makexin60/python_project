1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
1.1 Types of Data We Collect
“Personal Data” means any data that allows someone to identify or contact an individual data subject, including, for example, name, address, telephone number, email address, as well as any other non-public information that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
1.2 Information You Provide Us
Account Information.
When you sign up for an Account, we may require certain information such as your full name, organization, phone number, email address(s) and password. You may optionally choose to sign into Contacts+ using a third party (e.g., your Google login). If you choose to do this, you will be asked whether you agree to the third party providing certain information to Contacts+, such as your name, email address, profile photo, and other information associated with your account.
Profile Information.
To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to create a profile including information such as your name, photo, email, phone, urls, physical address, instant message handles, dates, job title, gender, bio, and interests.
Referrals.
When you use Contacts+ to refer our Services to others we will collect and use any contact information you choose to provide and automatically generate an invitation to the contacts you select.
Payment Information.
Some of our Services require payment. We may use third party service providers such as
Stripe
to collect all information necessary to complete the transaction. Such information may include name, credit card and billing information, as well as additional fields required for payment. We never share your billing and payment information.
General Communication.
If you contact us (for example via email or phone) we will collect information such as your name, phone number, email address, as well as any other content that you provide. We also may create event logs to diagnose product or app related issues, and capture information relating to any support or service issues. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives and analyze any feedback provided through voluntary customer surveys.
Additional Information.
You may otherwise choose to provide us information when you fill in a form, conduct a search, update or add information to your Account, respond to surveys, provide feedback, request support, post to forums, participate in promotions, or use other features of our Services. We may also collect information at other points in our Services when clearly stated that information is being collected.
1.3 Information We Receive from Your Use of Our Services
1.3.1 Your Contacts
We provide a variety of Services that enable you to effectively manage contact information that you provide to us as part of the Services (your “Contacts”, also referred to as “End User Contact Data” in our Terms of Use located at
www.contactsplus.com/terms
). Contacts typically contain information on individuals (or organizations) including names, email addresses, phone numbers, URLs, social handles, online identifiers, and physical addresses. Your Contacts may also contain additional information on individuals such as organizational affiliations, job titles, birthdays, key dates, age, gender, general location, relationships, skills, interests, preferences, notes, photos, tags and other categorizations. Depending on which Services you elect to use, Contacts may be collected in one or more of the following ways:
Connected Services.
Many of our Services allow you to connect with external systems or databases that contain your Contacts. Examples include but are not limited to: 1) third-party contact management applications and services, 2) communication applications such as email providers, video conferencing systems, calendar applications, and social networks, and 3) sales, marketing, customer service, and media applications and platforms. Connections to such services generally require you to sign into those services.
User Interfaces.
Many of our Services allow you to directly enter, edit, or otherwise manage your Contacts by means such as typing into a user interface or speaking to a voice interface.
APIs.
Contacts may also be collected when you submit Contacts through our API. This includes both APIs for directly managing contacts as well as APIs for lookup or search.
Uploaded Files.
You may also elect to upload lists of Contacts to Contacts+ for processing.
Third-Party Applications.
Contacts+ may enable you to manually or automatically transfer, upload, or copy-and-paste contact information from certain third-party applications into Contacts+.
Contact Extraction.
You may elect certain Contacts+ features that extract Contacts from email, text or photographs. Examples include our business card scanning feature and our email signature extraction feature. We will
not
process the content of the communication unless you have explicitly asked us to do so.
Shared Contacts.
Other users may elect to share their Contacts or their personal contact details with you.
Caller ID:
When caller ID is enabled for Android phones only, parts of the call log may be sent to our servers for caller identification.
1.3.2 Relationship Information
We provide a variety of Services that enable you to effectively manage your relationships. Depending on which Services you elect to use, relationship information may be collected in one or more of the following ways:
Your Contacts.
Your Contacts suggest a certain relationship between you and the people or organizations those Contacts represent. Your Contacts may explicitly indicate the nature of the relationship. We may also infer the strength or nature of a relationship based on the presence or absence of certain contact information such as mobile numbers or key dates, as well as shared elements such as physical addresses or organizational affiliations. Inferred relationship information may also be based on how you interact with individual Contacts such as how often you access or modify them.
Connected Services.
Many of our Services allow you to connect with external systems or databases that may contain information on your relationships, such as “connections” on social networks or other platforms.
Communication MetaData
. Some of our Services may infer relationship information based on communication patterns. For example, any time communication is initiated within our Apps, we may collect communication metadata including the individual contacted, the time, and the length or duration of the communication. We may similarly collect communication metadata from services you have elected to connect to Contacts+, such as email providers. In some cases, communication metadata may be collected directly from a device. We will
not
process the content of the communication unless you have explicitly asked us to do so (e.g., for purposes of contact extraction).
Appointment Data
. If you have connected a calendar or scheduling service to Contacts+, we may collect information such as the appointment time, location, duration, and participants.
1.3.3 Location Information
Geo-location.
When you use certain features of our Services, we may collect information about your precise or approximate location as determined through data such as your IP address or mobile device’s GPS to offer you an improved user experience. Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu.
Maps Services.
Parts of the Services may use maps services such as Google Maps, Apple Maps and Waze. Use of each service is subject to the respective service’s terms of use (including
Google Maps Additional Terms of Use
) and their respective privacy policies. We recommend you read the respective services terms of use and privacy policies prior to using them.
1.3.4 Usage and Device Information
We may collect the following information from the applications and devices you use to access our Services:
Usage Information.
We collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as when you login, pages you visit, buttons you click, and other actions performed with our Services. This includes usage information related to connected services as well as our APIs.

We automatically collect log data and device information when you access and use our Services, even if you have not created an Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Services, IP address, access dates and times, hardware and software information, device information, device event information, unique identifiers, crash data, cookie data, and the pages you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Services.
Cookies and Similar Technologies.
We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on our Platform or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, our Services currently do not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted.
1.4 Information We Receive from Third Parties.
We may receive information that others provide about you when they use the Services (through Contacts provided to us as described above), or obtain information from other sources, including but not limited to public or licensed APIs (“Public Data”), and combine that with information we collect through the Services. We do not control, supervise, or respond for how the third parties providing your information process your Personal Data.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic or interests data, from third party service providers and/or partners, and combine that information with information we have about you. We may receive information about you and your activities whether as part of or outside our Services through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.
2. HOW WE USE INFORMATION
We use, store, and process information, including Personal Data, to provide, understand, improve, and develop our Services, create and maintain a trusted and safer environment, and comply with our legal obligations. Contacts+ use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to
Google API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
2.1 Provide, Maintain, and Support the Services
Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our Terms of Use. For example, we may process your Contacts to provide you with the contact management features you select, including but not limited to Contact storage, backup, editing, synchronization, deduplication, search, tagging, sharing, and grouping.
Relationship information may be used for relationship management services including determining, classifying, and ranking relationships, as well as recommending communication actions, appointments, or new connections. Relationship information may also be used to improve certain contact management functions such as deduplication, tagging, and grouping.
We also need to use the information you provide (including Personal Data) to facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network, identify you as a user in our system, provide improved administration and quality of experience of our Site and Services, send email, call, or send SMS text messages to you to verify ownership of the email address or phone number provided when your Account was created, send you service, support or maintenance messages, updates, security alerts, and Account notifications. Your information may also be used for the detection and prevention of fraud, spam, abuse, and other harmful activity, and for any purpose you authorize at the time of collection.
Additionally, to provide you technical support, we may need to review your Account and the contents of your Account to identify, research, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues that you report to us or that we otherwise become aware of.
2.2 Improve, Personalize, and Develop the Services
We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; and develop new features and services.
2.3 Provide, Personalize, Measure, and Improve our Advertising and Marketing
We may process your information (including Personal Data) for marketing purposes including profiling and offering you products or services that may be of interest to you (such as information about our Services or partner campaigns and other third party services). We may also administer referral programs, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, newsletters, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or a third party partners. You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in our marketing communications or changing your notification settings within your Account.
We may also process your Contacts and relationship information to suggest people for you to invite to use our Services. When you have chosen to send a referral to another individual or organization, we may process your Contacts and relationship information to facilitate your referral invitations.
2.4 Combine Contacts Across Users
By selectively combining your Contacts and relationship information with information from other users we can provide you and other users with enhanced features and Services. Your Contacts may be combined with other Users’ Contacts, as well as Public Data and other publicly available information and information we receive from third parties, to build more complete contact records of individuals (“Completed Contact Data”). Completed Contact Data reside in our Database and may be processed for the purposes described in the remainder of this section.
Completed Contact Data may be used to provide you and other Users of our Services with enhanced deduplication. Deduplication is a service that cleans up Contacts by automatically merging duplicate Contact records. The deduplication service relies on making associations between different Contact elements. For example, you might have two Contacts for the same individual in your address book or in your Customer database or file: one Contact that contains just a first name and a phone number, and a second Contact that contains a full name and an email address only. In order to determine whether those two Contacts represent the same individual and should be merged, we look at the Completed Contact Data for that individual. If, in this example, both the phone number and the email address exist within Completed Contact Data for that individual, we may automatically merge (or suggest you to merge) your two Contacts. In the above example, we may have learned of the linkage between the phone number and email address from publicly available sources. In other cases, we may have been able to infer the linkage or we may have learned the linkage from one or more other Users of our Services who have contributed a Contact that contains those two contact elements together. In this way you are benefiting from information that other Users of our Services have contributed to Completed Contact Data. Similarly, contributing your information to Completed Contact Data benefits other Users of our Services. Relationship information from you and other Users of our Services may also be used in providing enhanced deduplication. For example, the fact that two Contacts in your address book contain the same first name may increase the chances that those Contacts represent the same individual.
Your Contact information may also be combined with other Users of our Services data to provide contact enrichment. In contact enrichment, a User is able to match a Contact that they possess to our Completed Contact Data and receive back a subset of the contact information from the relevant Completed Contact Data for that individual. For example, we may share an individual’s name to support features including but not limited to caller ID. We also may share public social handles to support Contact Enrichment. Certain professional information including but not limited to business emails, organizational affiliation and job title, that can be inferred or extracted from a business card or email signature, may also be shared. Finally, generalized demographic information such as age range and gender, affinities, unique pseudonymized identifiers, as well as derived general location from a phone number or physical address, may also be shared. We will never share physical addresses, personal phone numbers, personal emails unless you have given us your specific and unequivocal permission to share that information or we have secured the information via pseudonymization (e.g., through cryptographic hashing). We will never share any of your private notes with any other User.
We also use Completed Contact Data to provide Contact Search, such as when a User of our Services wants to retrieve a set of Completed Contact Data based on a set of search criteria. With the exception of the shareable contact elements described above, all contact elements in a Completed Contact are considered private and are not shared with other Users of our Services. However, any contact element (including those private elements) may be used for lookup and matching purposes.
2.5 Creation of Anonymous Data
We may create Anonymous Data records from information by excluding certain private data in a manner that makes the data not personally identifiable. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation. We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our sole discretion.
2.6 Additional Limits on Use of Your Google User Data
Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, if you provide the App access to the following types of your Google data, the App’s use of that data will be subject to these additional restrictions:
The App will only use access to a read permission to provide a signature extraction feature that allows you to pull signature information from emails directly to your contacts. We will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
The App will not request the following permissions: write, modify, or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings.
The App will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements.
The App will not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for the App’s internal operations and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized.
App’s use of information received, and App’s transfer of information to any other app, from Google APIs will adhere to Google’s Limited Use Requirements.

Privacy Notice for Data Subjects
This Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) is intended for anyone who wishes to review, modify, restrict or take ownership of the information that Contacts+ might have on them, as well as understand how we use that information. Additional information for our Users can be found in the
Privacy Policy
.
Overview
Our core purpose is to
make relationships better
. In today’s fast-paced and multi-layered world, keeping up with everyone you know both online and offline can prove daunting. Discovering, building, and cultivating authentic relationships with the people that matter most to you, both personally and professionally, is hard with our data scattered and fragmented all over the digital world. Most of us also expect the companies that we interact with to treat us like humans and know who we are as a person, not cogs in some machine. Sometimes, having the right information at the right time makes all the difference.
You can think of Contacts+ as the “phone book” for the modern digital world. We do our best to bring together contact information from a variety of public sources (such as is available on the Internet through a simple Google Search) and combine it with contact information that our users contribute (similar to Wikipedia). We couple that with powerful tools for individuals and companies to manage their contacts.
We aim to have the most complete, accurate, and up-to-date record we can for each person in our “phone book” (also known as the “Contacts+ Database”). The types of information we may keep track of include contact elements such as name, address, phone number, email, social profiles, and device IDs. We often also have professional information (such as organizational affiliations, job titles, and skills) as well as personal information (such as interests, relationships, and basic demographic data like age, gender, and location). In many cases we may also find associated profile photos.
All of this information is intended to help the people and companies you interact with to know you better and be able to develop true and meaningful relationships with you. Based on the information someone already has on you, they might look you up in our system and get back some additional information. However, we never share the information that is dearest to your individual privacy: your home addresses, personal email addresses, or your personal phone numbers, unless you have given us your specific and unequivocal permission to share that information or we have secured the information via pseudonymization (e.g., through cryptographic hashing). That means, for example, that a company would not be able to know your personal email unless you have given us your explicit permission or had provided your personal email previously to them.
The information in our system also helps the people and companies you interact with to clean up their own “address books” so that they don’t have information about you scattered across multiple systems and devices and so that they don’t connect with you multiple times, through different channels, with information that its is entirely irrelevant to you . We help our people and companies to gather their existing information into clean contact records for each individual they know.
We also allow people or companies to search in our system for individuals who meet certain criteria. For example, a professional who’s trying to find an expert in their field can use our Services to find the right person. Similarly, an organization could search for the most appropriate audience for their offerings. However, unless you have given us your specific permission, or we have secured the information via pseudonymization (e.g., through cryptographic hashing), we will not provide home addresses, personal email addresses, or personal phone numbers.
In all cases, our goal is to help people and companies make better, more valuable connections. We recognize, however, that not everyone is comfortable sharing their contact information with others. For this reason, anyone can take ownership of their information in our system at any time here:
https://www.contactsplus.com/sar
.
Actually, we hope that you do choose to take ownership of your information and help keep our “phone book” as accurate and up-to-date as possible. It is only through the contributions of people like you that we can provide this valuable service to you and everyone else. Our dream is to have everyone owning their data, fully controlling where it flows, and seeing better relationships in return. We may ask in time for your consent to use that data but as of right now we shall keep our “books open” and you can restrict processing of some parts or all of your data. Period. Please reach out at any time
privacy@contactsplus.com
with any ideas on how we can serve you better.
Your Rights
Anyone, in any country across the world, may access, rectify, or restrict their Personal Data within Contacts+ Database at any time by visiting
https://www.contactsplus.com/sar
. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking action on your request. If you ask us to erase your data, we may still have to retain certain data about you to ensure that your Personal Data does not re-enter our system and protect your rights. Specifically, we will mark your Personal Data as “hidden” and “restrict processing” such that your data is no longer used or made available to anyone.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California law permits users and customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their Personal Data (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of Personal Data disclosed to those third parties. See the “Contact Us” section below for where to send such requests.
GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)
Individuals in the EU may exercise any of the rights described in this section by using the applicable functionality in our Services or by contacting us directly. If you reside outside of the European Union, you may have similar rights under your local laws.
The purpose for processing, categories of Personal Data concerned, and categories of recipients of Personal Data are described in the “Overview” section above. Our lawful basis for processing is our legitimate interest in providing contact management services to our Users, enabling them to better connect and build their relationships with you. Personal Data will be retained as long as necessary to serve that purpose or until you decide it is not in your best interest to keep your information in the Contacts+ Database. You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data at any time.
If you have taken ownership of your data by following the necessary steps at
https://www.contactsplus.com/sar
or by contacting us directly, we may ask for your explicit permission to share certain of your Personal Data. If you choose to give permission to share certain information, then our lawful basis for processing is your Consent. You have the right to withdraw your Consent at any time. You also have the right of portability for any data that you have provided us.
You have the right to request from us access to and rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of processing. You may exercise these rights at
https://www.contactsplus.com/sar
or by contacting us directly. Requests for erasure can not be met because erasing your Personal Data would not achieve the desired result of your Personal Data not being in our system: we receive data continuously and would likely have your Personal Data in our system again quickly. Instead, we will mark your Personal Data as “hidden” and “restrict processing” such that your data is no longer used in providing our service and is no longer made available to anyone.
You have the right to request the sources of your Personal Data. You may do so by contacting us as indicated in the “Contact Us” section below. Please note that to protect the rights of other data subjects, we may only be able to provide you with the general categories of sources.
We may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of companies or with service providers based in the United States. Contacts+ complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with your applicable supervising authority.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Security information
Data encryption
Firebase services encrypt data in transit using HTTPS and logically isolate
customer data.
In addition, several Firebase services also encrypt their data at rest:
Cloud Firestore
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Cloud Functions for Firebase
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase Realtime Database
Cloud Storage for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Firebase Test Lab
Firebase App Check
Firebase App Distribution
Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data
Firebase Service Data is personal information that Google collects and generates
during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.
Examples of Firebase Service Data include information about service usage,
resource identifiers like application IDs and package name/bundle IDs, technical
and operational details of usage such as IP addresses, and direct communications
with developers from feedback and support related conversations.
*Services covered include Firebase A/B Testing, Firebase App Distribution,
  Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Dynamic Links,
  Firebase Hosting, Firebase In-App Messaging, Firebase ML,
  Firebase Performance Monitoring, Firebase Realtime Database,
  Firebase Remote Config, and Firebase User Segmentation Storage.
**For more information about how we process Customer Data, see our
Firebase Data Processing and Security
  Terms
.
Examples of how Firebase Service Data is processed by Firebase
Google uses Firebase Service Data in accordance with our
privacy policy
and applicable terms.
Firebase Service Data is used, for example, to:
Provide Firebase services you request
Make recommendations to optimize use of Firebase services
Maintain and improve Firebase services
Provide and improve other services you request
Understand your use of Firebase and other Google services
Provide better support to and communicate with you
Protect you, our users, the public and Google

Firebase Service Data use by non-Firebase Google services
You can control whether your Firebase Service Data may be used by Google to
provide more in depth analysis, insights, and recommendations about
non-Firebase
Google services and improve
non-Firebase
Google services.
You can configure this in your Firebase data privacy settings page.
If this control is disabled, Firebase Service Data will continue to be used
for other purposes, such as those mentioned above, in accordance with our
privacy policy
and applicable terms, including
to make recommendations about and improve
Firebase
services, and to deliver
and improve other services you request, such as Google products you link to your
Firebase project.

Terms of Service
Effective: October 2, 2024
This Privacy Policy describes how and when Rollbar collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. Rollbar receives your information through our various websites, APIs, email notifications, integrations, and applications (the
"Services"
) and from our partners and other third parties. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Rollbar to use your information in the United States and any other country where Rollbar operates.
All capitalized terms that are not defined herein have the meanings given them in the Rollbar Terms of Service at
https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/terms-of-service
. If your access to the Services is granted subject to a Master Services Agreement or other agreement entered into by you and Rollbar (in either case, an
“Alternative Agreement”
), that Alternative Agreement may have modified the Privacy Policy below. Please contact for details.
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
privacy@rollbar.com
.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, and protect our Services:
Information You Provide:
Basic Account Information.
We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your email address, username, and password) in order to be able to save your profile and the accounts, projects, and other data associated with it.
Payment and Billing Information.
We also collect credit card or payment information for paid subscriptions. This information will be securely stored with a third party specialized in the handling of such information, such as a credit card payment gateway or other payment vendors.
Messages.
If you correspond with us, you may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our engineering, sales, or support teams about a question regarding the Services, or post a question about your application or our Services in our public forums.
Telephone Information.
If we telephone you, or you telephone us, to discuss our Services, we may collect personal information from you, including your name, company name, business address, phone number, job title, email address, whether you use the Services, information about your business needs, the number of users of our Services you require, and, if you telephoned us, how you heard about us, and any other information you choose to share with us by telephone.
Information We Collect Automatically:
Device Information.
Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your account on the Services.
Usage Information.
We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, viewing, and moving files or folders). We use this information to improve our Services, develop new services and features, and protect our Users.
Location Information.
We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.
Cookies and Similar Technologies.
We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. A cookie is a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that may uniquely identify your browser that lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Services. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Services (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the Services, and other actions you take on the Services), and allow us to track your usage of the Services over time. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. Similarly, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track your usage patterns on the Services, or place clear gifs in HTML-based emails we send you to track which emails are opened and which links you click. This information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Services.
Information We Collect from Other Sources:
Authentication Services.
We allow Users with certain third-party accounts (currently Users who have GitHub, Google, Heroku, Okta, OneLogin, or Bitium accounts) to authenticate on the Services using those third-party accounts (each, an “Identity Provider”). If you authenticate on the Services using an Identity Provider, the Identity Provider may send us your registration or basic profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables us to authenticate you and improve the Services, and is deleted from Rollbar within 30 days of your disconnecting your Identity Provider account from the Services.
Third Party Analytics Services.
We may also receive information from third party services to help us better understand you and how you use our Services.
End Users.
We also process information about end users of our Users’ Products, on behalf of our Users and in accordance with our user agreements. Typically, the information we receive from an end user may include the end user’s name, email address, and device information, such as a description of the error or bug the end user experienced while using a Product provided by one of our Users, as well as any other information the User elects to share with us in the context of reporting or tracking the error experienced by an end user in a User’s Product. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our Users for their Products isn’t covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage our Users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information.
Information Collected by Third Parties:
As noted above, sometimes we receive information about you from third party analytics service providers, such as Google, Intercom, Wootric, and other third party service providers. In order to gain useful insights, these analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain features, and deliver features or content that may be more targeted to your needs. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Rollbar and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers. We cannot be responsible for how these third party cookies are used, and you should consult the privacy policies of these third parties for more information about how they use cookies.
Purposes for Collection:
We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:
To provide you the Services, including for example, reporting errors and bugs in your Products and billing you for the Services;
To maintain, monitor, and improve the Services by adding new features, sharing new use cases, or making the Services easier to use;
To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how you interact with our Services;
For our own internal benchmarking, for example, to measure, and gauge the effectiveness of the Services, our advertising of the Services, and to better understand user retention and attrition–for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time;
To prevent problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Rollbar and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services;
To personalize your experience using our Services, remember your preferences on the Services so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Services, target our marketing messages to groups of our Users (for example, those who have a particular plan with us or have been our user for a certain length of time), to serve relevant advertisements; and
To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers and promotions offered by Rollbar and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on what we’re up to and our products. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our free Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. For further information on your choices regarding your choices with regard to the use of your information for marketing purposes, see "Your Choices Regarding Your Information" below.
LEGAL BASIS FOR COLLECTING AND USING INFORMATION
We collect and use the personal data described above based on the following grounds:
The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service at
https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/terms-of-service
or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account–for example, in order to enable access to our Services on your device or charge you for a paid subscription; or
Compliance with a legal obligation necessitates the use; or
The protection of your vital interests or those of another person require the use; or
We have a legitimate interest in using your information–for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience; or
You have given us your consent.
INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
We collect and use the personal data described above based on the following grounds:
Others Working with Rollbar.
We may share information about you within the United States and abroad, with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you, such as payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and those that help us deliver our Services (like hosting and content delivery providers). We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. Rollbar ensures that such recipients of your private personal data will offer an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into an agreement with standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission or, to the extent valid and available, by requiring that the recipients subscribe to the Data Privacy Framework Principles.
Other Users.
Our Services display information like your name, profile picture, and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. You can also share aspects of your Product with other users in certain forums and features of the Services intended to be public if you choose. When you register your Rollbar account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer, educational institution, or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile picture, and email address—visible to other users on the same organization. This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.
Account Administrators.
If your use of the Services is pursuant to an agreement entered into by your employer or other organization to which you belong, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Rollbar team account. Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.
Your Consent.
Certain features let you make additional information available to others.
Other Applications.
You can also give third-party providers access to your information and account—for example, via Rollbar APIs at
https://docs.rollbar.com/reference/getting-started-1
.  Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.
Law & Order and the Public Interest. Third parties as required to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena/court order, legal process or other government request, (b) enforce our Terms of Service, including the investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Rollbar, its users or the public as required or permitted by law and (e) detect, prevent or otherwise address criminal (including fraud or stalking), security or technical issues.
Business Transfers and Affiliates.
In the event that Rollbar is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services.
Aggregated and De-Identified Information.
We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
No Other Disclosures or Uses.
We will not (i) disclose your personal information to any third party that is not acting as an agent, under contract with us, to perform tasks on our behalf and under our instructions, or (ii) use your personal information for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION
Account Data.
All Rollbar account holders may review, update, correct or delete the personal information in their registration profile by logging into their account. Rollbar account holders may also contact us at
privacy@rollbar.com
to accomplish the foregoing or if you have additional requests or questions.
Access to Data Controlled by Our Users.
Rollbar has no direct relationship with the end users of our Users’ Products whose personal information is contained within the personal data processed by our Services. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete personal information provided by our Users should direct their request the specific User. You may also contact us at
privacy@rollbar.com
if you have additional questions or concerns.
Marketing Communications.
If you do not wish to receive promotional emails, you can click the "unsubscribe" button on promotional email communications. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices. We sometimes contact people who do not have a Rollbar account. For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before contacting you. If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by Rollbar, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.
Analytics Services.
As noted above, analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of the Services, and potentially your use of other websites and online services. For more information about how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org. For further information on what information is collected by analytics service providers and why, see "What We Collect and Why."
Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies.
At this time, Rollbar does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using the Services, with the drawback that certain features of the Services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Close Your Account.
Of course, while it’s hard to say goodbye, we understand that sometimes you just need to move on. You can delete your information from within your account or close your account and keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Store Your Information below–for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
Access and Take Your Data.
You can download a copy of your content in a machine readable format as outlined in your account settings. If the export option is ever unavailable for any reason, you can also request a copy of the personal data you provided to us by sending a request to
privacy@rollbar.com
.
HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION
Security
. We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, and to ensure that the information we process is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current to the extent necessary for the purposes for which we use the information. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please contact us immediately if you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure. Our Security and Compliance page at
https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/security
describes the measures we take to secure the Services and your data.
Location of Storage
. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process, and transmit information in the United States and locations around the world—including those outside your country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.
Retention
. When you sign up for an account with us, we’ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account is in existence or as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we will immediately initiate deletion of your information. Deletion of your information, including deletion of your information from our backup storage, will be completed within 30 days of your request. But please note we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.
Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have the following data protection rights.
For personal information we have about you, you can:
Access your personal information or request a copy.
You have the right to be notified of what personal information we collect about you and how we use it, disclose it and protect it.
Change or correct your personal information.
Delete or erase your personal information.
Object to the processing of your personal information.
Ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information.
Export your personal data.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local organizations in charge of enforcing the privacy legislation applicable in your territory.
You have the right to request that we export to you in a machine-readable format all of the personal information we have about you.
If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us at
privacy@rollbar.com
.
TRANSFERRING YOUR DATA
Because the Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the What We Collect and Why section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include, for instance, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them or, to the extent valid and available, ensuring they have signed up to the EU-US DPF or Swiss-US DPF.
Rollbar complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Rollbar has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Rollbar has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. You can find Rollbar’s Data Privacy Framework certification at
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list
. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
In cases of onward transfers of personal data to third parties, Rollbar is potentially liable for the acts or omissions of such third parties that are in violation of the DPF Principles.
Rollbar is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Data Privacy Framework compliance—free of charge to you. We ask that you first submit any such complaints directly to us via
privacy@rollbar.com.
If you aren’t satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
. In the event your concern still isn’t addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under Data Privacy Framework and its principles.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Acceptable Use Policy,
where you can see that Fullstory has high standards regarding how our customers respect your privacy.

California Consumer Privacy Act

You have the right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights.
Fullstory may disclose your Personal Information to commercial providers for a business purpose, which includes verifying your identity when you make a payment or registering access to your accounts.  When we disclose Personal Information for these reasons, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not to use it for any purpose except for the purposes set forth in the contract.

Privacy Rights for Californians
Under the CCPA, California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes Californians' rights and explains how California residents can exercise those rights.
Below we further outline specific rights which California residents may have under the CCPA.
Right to Access Your Data.
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12- month period preceding the receipt of your request.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
Right to Data Portability.
You have the right to a "portable" copy of your Personal Information that you have submitted to us. Generally, this means you have a right to request that we move, copy or transmit your Personal Information stored on our servers or information technology environment to another service provider's servers or information technology environment.
Right to Delete Your Data.
You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
Right of correction
. You have the right to request correction or changes of your Personal Information if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date.
Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights.
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising your privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.
How to Submit a Request
You may submit a request to exercise your rights to know/access or delete your Personal Information through one of two means:
Submit a request via email to
privacy@fullstory.com
, or
Call 1-833-385-5786 to submit your request.
Upon submission of your request, we will contact you via the email address provided in your request.  To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information.  In some instances, such as a request for data deletion, we may first separately confirm that you would like for us to in fact delete your personal information before acting on your request.  With all requests, we will aim to complete requests as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with any timeframes mandated by applicable laws. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. You may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, or designate an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf through these means.
In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process Personal Information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.);
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;
Comply with a legal obligation; or
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

Fullstory does not sell certain Personal Information as described above. Fullstory does not engage in profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. Fullstory does engage in “targeted advertising” as that term is defined in VCDPA.

Right to Delete Your Data.
You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
