Disclaimers
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PAPAYA DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS) AS TO THE SERVICE.

‍
Dispute Resolution; Class Action Waiver
YOU SHOULD REVIEW THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS, EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT YOU FILE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN THE STATE OR MUNICIPALITY OF YOUR RESIDENCE WITHIN THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMITS OF THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND AS LONG AS SUCH MATTER IS ONLY PENDING IN THAT COURT. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A FAIR HEARING, BUT THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. AN ARBITRATOR’S DECISION IS AS ENFORCEABLE AS ANY COURT ORDER AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO THIS PROVISION AS A CONDITION OF ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE.
If you have a complaint/dispute, you must first notify us at help@ppaya.com and attempt to resolve it with us informally. You may also write to the address below. Note that email is the optimum method of communication.

‍
Customer Service is available Monday through Sunday from 4AM - 9PM (PT).
If Papaya is unable to resolve any complaint/dispute you bring to its attention within sixty (60) days of receipt of your notice or we raise any complaint/dispute, you and we agree that, except where prohibited by law or as set forth above (small claims court), all complaints/disputes shall be resolved individually and exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”). For more information on the AAA, the AAA Rules, or the process for filing an arbitration claim, you may call the AAA at (800) 778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.
You and we agree to the following with respect to the arbitration of any complaint/dispute: (1) ANY CLAIM MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (3) the arbitration will be held at a location in your hometown area unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration; (4) you will pay any filing fee or other costs of arbitration only as required under the AAA Rules or as otherwise specified by the arbitrator; (5) Papaya reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration; (6) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (7) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (8) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (9) each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded by the arbitrator will be determined in accordance with applicable law. ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, WHETHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL OR A CLASS BASIS, IS HEREBY WAIVED.
This Section will survive the termination of the Service or these Terms. With the exception of the provisions prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the AAA Rules, then the balance of this provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting part was not contained herein. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the Dispute will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence.
‍
Entire Agreement
These Terms, including
Papaya’s Privacy Policy
along with the terms, privacy policy and agreements of/with other third parties referenced within, constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us relating to the Service and cancel and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements and other communications between you and us, whether written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the Service.

Privacy Protection with Papaya
Your personal data is constantly at risk. Papaya Privacy Protection removes sensitive personal data from hundreds of websites, monitors the dark web for breaches, and includes $1M in identity theft insurance to safeguard your household.
How Privacy Protection works
Scan
Papaya scans over 100 data brokers and the dark web to identify exposed personal data, including phone numbers, email addresses, and home addresses, that could put you or your family at risk of fraud.
Remove
Papaya automatically removes your exposed data from data broker sites, helping protect your digital identity. Our service saves you hours of time and frustration.
Monitor
Papaya continuously monitors data brokers and the dark web to detect new exposures. You’ll receive alerts about potential threats, data breaches, or suspicious activity, allowing you to take action to protect your identity. When data brokers re-list your information, we automatically initiate the removal process.
Why choose Papaya Privacy Protection?
Data brokers (also called people search sites) pose serious risks like identity theft, fraud, spam, and harassment to you and your loved ones. With Papaya Privacy Protection, you can safeguard your household and protect up to 4 family members from these threats.
Identified as “PAPAYA PRIVACY SUBSCR” on your bank statement, Papaya Privacy Protection automatically removes your data from these sites, protecting your digital identity.
It also includes dark web monitoring to detect exposed data from hundreds of data breaches. Our $1M identity theft insurance covers legal costs, lost wages, and more in the event of theft; identity restoration services are also included to assist in recovery.
What our customers say
Papaya does the heavy lifting so I don't have to! They remove me from lists and monitor publicly available information from 'scraper' sites which is info I don't think should be easily available.
Kathleen M.
It has shown me areas I did not know that I was exposed to.
Ju F.
It doesn’t cost that much, a great value for all it can do to keep my information safe and secure”

FAQs
What is a data broker, or people search site?
Data brokers and people search sites are companies that collect, aggregate, and sell personal information about individuals. They gather data from various public and private sources, including social media, public records, and online activities. These sites often make your personal information easily accessible to anyone searching for it, which can pose privacy and security risks.
Why should I remove my information from these sites?
According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), data brokers, people search sites and other online sources have information about nearly every US consumer, which increases your risk of identity theft, hacks, robo calls, and more.
How long does it take to remove my information?
Initial removals typically begin within days, but complete removal can take several weeks depending on the data broker.
What type of information do you remove?
We remove personal data such as name, address, phone number, email, and relatives' information from public databases.
How can I track my removal progress?
You can track your progress anytime by logging into your account dashboard. We will also email you periodic reports on your progress.
Can Papaya guarantee all my information will be removed?
While we strive for complete removal, new information can always appear online. That's why we offer continuous monitoring and removal services.
How do I change my billing information?
To change your billing information, please contact our Customer Service team. You may reach us through email privacy@papayapay.com or by calling 888-850-5196.
