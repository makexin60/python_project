Note about access to camera.
When you choose to upload photos to the App, you will typically grant us permission to access your camera or your device’s photo library. You provide such a permission through the request that appears on your mobile device (it may differ depending on your device’s operating system). You can revoke the permission through the settings on your mobile device, and here’s how to do it.
If you use an iOS device:
On your iPhone or iPad open the Settings app.
Scroll down and tap “Privacy”.
Tap “Camera” or “Photos”.
Next to Simple, toggle the permissions switching on or off.
If you use an Android device:
On your device open the Settings app.

Tap “Simple”. If you can’t find it, tap “See all apps”, then choose Simple.
Tap “Permissions”.
To change a permission setting, tap it, then choose “Allow” or “Don’t allow”.
Note about payment data. When you make payments through the Services, you need to provide payment data, such as your credit card number, to our third-party service providers that act as our data and payment processors.

Aggregated information.
We may aggregate, anonymize, or de-identify your personal data so that it cannot be reasonably used to identify you. We may share such data with third parties such as academic research institutions or use the data for statistical purposes. For example, we may share or use general age and demographic information and aggregate statistics about certain activities or symptoms from data collected to help identify patterns across users in articles, blog posts, and scientific publications.
For certain targeted academic or user research studies, we will contact you and rely on your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at

We use your personal data in Avo prompts, including your food preferences, health conditions, meal logs, fasting logs, activity logs, and other personal data, so that Avo can provide relevant and safe responses to your requests.

While communicating with Avo, do not provide any information that may directly identify you or any other people.
Where and how long are my conversations stored?
All the conversations shared with Avo are stored on our Amazon Web Server (AWS) in the United States until you decide to delete these conversations.

11. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
The date this Privacy Policy was last reviewed is indicated at the top of the page. The Company may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent or notification: for example, when we make changes for the sake of transparency, when we add a new purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or a new processing activity that falls under the users’ reasonable expectations. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this Privacy Policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. This can negatively affect some of our Services provided to you if those Services inevitably require consent to the changes.
