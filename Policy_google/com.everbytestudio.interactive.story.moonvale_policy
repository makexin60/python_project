General information on data processing
Scope of the processing of personal data
As a general rule, we only collect and use the personal data of our users to the extent necessary to provide our Website, our content and our services (in particular Games). We regularly only collect and use the personal data of our users after they have given their consent to such processing. An exception applies in cases where it is not possible to obtain consent in advance for factual reasons and processing is permitted by legal regulations.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data
Where we obtain the data subject’s consent to the processing of personal data, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
For the processing of personal data which is necessary to perform a contract to which the data subject is a party, the legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract.
Where personal data must be processed to comply with a legal obligation to which our company is subject, the legal basis for processing is Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, the legal basis is Art. 6(1)(d) GDPR.
Where personal data must be processed to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, and where the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not override such legitimate interest, the legal basis for processing such data is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Erasure of data and storage period
The personal data of data subjects is erased or blocked when the purpose for which it was stored no longer exists. The data may be stored beyond such time where the European or national legislator provided for this in Union law regulations, laws or other legal regulations to which the controller is subject. Data is also blocked or erased when a storage period required by the aforementioned legal norms expires unless we must continue to store the data for the execution or performance of a contract.
Provision of the Website and creation of logfiles
Every time our Website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the system of the computer accessing our website. In this context, the following data is collected for a limited period of time:
User’s IP address
Date and time of access
Name of the file that was accessed and its URL
Status code of the access request
Size of the requested data in bytes
Referrer URL (website from which the access request originates)
Browser, operating system and interface of the visitor
The data is stored in the logfiles of our system. This data is only required for the analysis of any technical problems and will be erased within 14 days. The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the logfiles is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The system must temporarily store the user’s IP address to enable the provision of the Website and the Games to the user’s devices. For this purpose, the user’s IP address must be stored for the duration of the session. Data is stored in logfiles to ensure the functionality of the Website and the Games. In addition, the data is used to optimise the Website and the Games and to ensure the security of our IT systems. In this context, data is not analysed for marketing purposes or used to identify a person. The aforementioned collection of data to provide the Website and the storage of data in logfiles are indispensable for the operation of the Website and the Games. Consequently users are not entitled to object to such collection or storage.

The legal basis for processing the data is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our interest in replying to your inquiry outweighs your interest. Given that you are writing to us, our replying to your inquiry is ultimately in your interest too, and you are aware that we need to process your data to reply to your inquiry.

Google services
We use Google Fonts on this Website, i.e. the Google fonts provided by the company Google Inc. The company responsible for all Google services provided in the European region is Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland). When users visit our Website, the fonts are loaded afterwards using Google Fonts via a Google server. In the context of this external access, data such as the user’s IP address is sent to Google servers, including Google servers located in the USA. The legal basis for processing data in the context of the use of Google Fonts is our overriding legitimate interest in the appealing presentation and simple functionality of our Website in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Google processes the data in the USA on the basis of EU standard contractual clauses and thereby offers sufficient safeguards as described in Art. 46 (1), (2)(c) GDPR.

Payments
We offer users the opportunity to have payments for in-app purchases processed online by the payment service providers of the platforms. These service providers, as the relevant controller, process invoice data, such as card details, payment information, billing addresses, as well as other information required by law. We will never be able to view sensitive information, such as your full credit card or bank account number, held by any of the service providers, but merely receive the payment confirmation, with its allocation to the user (order ID), the country, the payment amount and the product, as well as the date of execution.
We have a legitimate interest in working with payment service providers and in redirecting you to them in the context of the payment process given that they facilitate payment processing for us and provide access to our services to a broader audience using such payment services and given that they also facilitate the payment process for you, as the user of such a payment service provider. The legal basis for redirecting users to such payment service providers is our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
The data processed by us for the purpose of confirming the payment will be erased when it is no longer needed for achieving the purpose for which it was collected. This applies when the verification of the relevant payment transaction has been completed and we were able to verify that the relevant payment transaction was authorised lawfully. The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
Where data we have a duty to retain or store based on tax law, commercial law or other regulations is generated in the context of payments, such data will only be erased upon the expiry of the relevant retention or storage periods specified by law (cf. III. no. 2). The legal basis for storing such data is Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
Processing carried out via Google Play: When you make a payment using Google Play, we disclose your payment data to Google Ireland Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Google”) in the context of payment processing. All data required for payment processing is transmitted securely using “SSL” technology.

Right of information
Where you have asserted the right of rectification, erasure or restriction of processing vis-à-vis the controller, the controller has a duty to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you was disclosed of such rectification or erasure of the data or the restriction of processing unless this turns out to be impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
You have the right to be informed about these recipients by the controller.
Right to data portability
You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you which you provided to the controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.

(1)
The processing is based on a consent in accordance with Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR or on a contract in accordance with Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR; and
(2)
The processing is carried out using automated means.
In the exercise of this right you also have the right to procure that the personal data concerning you be directly transmitted from one controller to another controller where this is technically feasible. This must not adversely affect the freedoms and rights of other individuals.
The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal data that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
Right to object
You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your personal situation, at any time to processing of the personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1) (e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to any profiling based on these provisions.

Where you object to the processing for purposes of direct marketing, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for such purposes.
In the context of the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, you may exercise your right to object by automated means using technical specifications.
Right to revoke the consent required under data protection law
You have the right to revoke your consent required under data protection law at any time. The revocation does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out based on the consent prior to such revocation.
Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
You have the right not to be subjected to a decision that is solely based on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal consequences for you or significantly adversely affects you in a similar way.
This does not apply where the decision:
(1)
Is necessary for the execution or performance of a contract between you and the controller;
(2)
Is permissible based on legal regulations of the Union or Member States to which the controller is subject and such legal regulations contain appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms, as well as your legitimate interests; or
(3)
Is made with your express consent.
Nevertheless, such decisions must not be based on special categories of personal data, as described in Art. 9(1) GDPR, unless Art. 9(2) (a) or (g) apply and appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms, as well as your legitimate interests, are in place.
With respect to the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the controller shall take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms, as well as your legitimate interests, which, as a minimum, shall include the right to procure the intervention of a natural person on the part of the controller, the data subject’s right to present his/her own point of view and the right to contest the decision.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
Notwithstanding any other remedy under administrative law or the right to apply to the courts, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged violation, if you believe that the personal data concerning you is processed in violation of the GDPR.
The supervisory authority to which the complaint was submitted will notify the complainant of the status and the outcome of the complaint, including the option to apply to the courts pursuant to Art. 78 GDPR.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup

rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.

legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

PRIVACY POLICY
About Us
Tapjoy, Inc. ("Tapjoy") operates an ad network platform that allows app developers to serve ads within their apps, and advertisers to promote their products, and services within apps.
We collect information in either of 2 ways:
Directly – through our SDKs integrated by app developers in their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information directly from such apps.
Indirectly – through other third-party mediation platforms with which we engage in order to serve ads in apps, or by receiving information from our advertisers, or affiliates.
Scope
This privacy policy describes Tapjoy’s privacy practices with respect to information it processes through its ad network. This privacy policy does not govern the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for advertisers.
Tapjoy serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example, whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado,Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, Texas, Montana, Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire, or New Jersey, please see the “State Privacy Rights” section of this privacy policy for information related to privacy laws in these states.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH OUR AD NETWORK PLATFORM
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”), on iOS devices . The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising companies to recognize a device across apps, for advertising purposes. You can find additional information about how to limit our use of the Advertising ID under “How to Control Information”. If you submit a customer support request to us, we will also collect your email address in order to respond to your request. If you opt in to receive marketing materials from us, we will also collect your email address in order to provide you information on our products and services.
General technical information about a device: Technical information such as the device’s time zone, the amount of free memory on the device, the name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status, operating system name and version, the language of the operating system, time zone, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection type (e.g. WiFi), etc.
Campaign information: An indication if an ad was viewed, or clicked, or if there was an install of an advertised app. Information about actions performed within an advertiser’s app following such an install, such as in-app purchases, and level in the game (if the advertiser chooses to provide such information). Publishers, at their option, may also share with us information about what level of the game you are on and your in-app purchases.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We (including our affiliates) use the information we collect through our ad network platform to provide you with the service and to serve ads on app developers' apps. More specifically, we use that information in the following ways:
Ad delivery: we use the information to technically enable the delivery of ads to your device.
To serve you offers customized based on your interests inferred from your past activity.
To serve you offers based on information such as the publisher app, technical parameters of the device, and interactions with the offerwall.
Reporting, billing and attribution: Generating reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.
Internal Operations: For internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Optimization and frequency capping: For optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of ads you view in a specific app.
Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in, or from their advertising campaigns.
To notify app developers of when you earn rewards through our platform, so they can increase your in-app virtual currency balances by the amount of the reward.
To respond to and resolve your customer support requests.
Where you have opted in, to provide you with marketing information about our products and services.
To prevent and detect fraud.
The GDPR Angle:
Our legal basis for processing personal data:
When we process personal data for operating our ad network, including for purposes listed above, such as optimization and frequency capping, reporting, attribution, fraud detection and prevention and internal operations, we process data as a data controller and we rely on our legitimate interests, and the legitimate interests of our app developer and advertiser partners.
When we process personal data for the purpose of serving you offers based on your interests, we process data as a data controller, and we rely on your consent.
When we process personal data for the purpose of providing you with marketing materials, we process data as a data controller, and we rely on your consent.
When we process personal data for the purpose of serving you offers based on information such as the publisher app, technical parameters of the device, and interactions with the offerwall, we rely on our legitimate interests, and the legitimate interests of our app developer and advertiser partners
When we process personal data for the purpose of excluding/including devices from, or in an ad campaign, we act as a processor on behalf of our app developer or advertiser partner, who also chooses the applicable legal basis for such processing, as the data controller.
We may also process personal data for compliance with applicable legal obligations. In that case, we shall act as a data controller and our legal basis is compliance with a legal obligation.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
We share information with:
App developers and advertisers: To provide you with the service and for the purposes of attribution, whitelisting/blacklisting and reporting, as stated above, for marketing purposes (subject to your consent), and as required to investigate and resolve your customer support requests.
Our corporate affiliates, including
Unity Technologies SF
: For the purposes described in this privacy policy.
Service providers: for the purpose of receiving services such as fraud detection and prevention, viewability measurement, reporting, and storage.
We may also disclose information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our agreements and policies, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) investigate, detect, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or other wrongdoing, suspected fraud or security issues; (iv) to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; (v) prevent harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users, yourself or any third party; (vi) for the purpose of collaborating with law enforcement agencies or in case we find it necessary in order to enforce intellectual property or other legal rights; or (vii) when we are undergoing any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of our assets.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP INFORMATION COLLECTED?
We keep information as long as necessary to provide our services or as permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law, for example, for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.Generally speaking. Information used for interest-based ad targeting is rotated out on a 90-day basis. Conversion data and non-production backups of production data are retained for longer due to financial records and disaster recovery requirements.
HOW TO CONTROL INFORMATION
Updated versions of iOS, and Android, enable you to control how apps can collect the Advertising ID. To do that, please follow the below instructions:
iOS devices (iOS 14+): go to Settings > Privacy > Tracking > Allow Apps to Request to Track. Please note that if you use more than one device, you need to opt-out separately in each device.
Android devices: Please follow the instructions set forth at:
https://support.google.com/ads/answer/1660762
(under Mobile devices). Please note that if you use more than one device, you need to opt-out separately in each device.
With regards to marketing emails, you may withdraw your consent using the unsubscribe link available at the bottom of all marketing emails we send to you.
Depending on the country or state in which you reside, you may have various privacy rights such as the right to request from us access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data we process as controllers, or to restrict or to object to processing of your personal data in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. To submit a request for exercising your rights, please use one of the following ways:
For access and erasure requests, submit your request through our online form, which can be accessed
here
.
For other data subject requests, please send an email with your request to the following address: tapjoy-privacy-request@unity3d.com.
Please note that we will process your request subject to verification, and authentication of your identity.
The GDPR Angle:
Withdraw consent – You have the right to withdraw the consent you provided to us. You can withdraw your consent from within the app you provided to us the consent (this will affect only our processing within this specific app), or by following the instructions above on how to control collection of device data (this will affect our processing of data of all apps on your device). With regards to marketing emails, you may withdraw your consent using the unsubscribe link available at the bottom of all marketing emails we send to you.
Data subject rights – Please note that you have the right to request from us access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data we process as controllers, or to restrict or to object to processing of your personal data in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. To submit a request for exercising your rights, please use one of the following ways:
For access and erasure requests, submit your request through our online form, which can be accessed
here
.
For other data subject requests, please send an email with your request to the following address: tapjoy-privacy-request@unity3d.com.
Please note that we will process your request subject to verification, and authentication of your identity.
Complaint to supervisory authority – You also have the right to file a complaint with the relevant
supervisory authority
(e.g. of your country or domicile) where Tapjoy has not addressed your concerns.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
We store information that we collect from a device on our Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud servers in the United States. Accordingly, please note that if you do not live in the United States, we will transfer your information to and store it in the United States.
The GDPR Angle:
We will transfer personal data to third parties located outside of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland based on standard contractual clauses.
CHILDREN
Developers using Tapjoy services may offer any of the following three categories of applications: 1) child-directed (Users are likely children), 2) mixed audience (users are both children and non-children), 3) non-child directed (users are unlikely to be children). If the application is mixed audience, the developer should implement an age-gate where required by law, and send a signal to Tapjoy which indicates that we need to limit data collection and not provide the Tapjoy service. The developer similarly categorizes applications which are specifically child-directed. A child is considered to be any user under the age of consent in their applicable jurisdiction.
In connection with the Tapjoy services, in the event we receive a signal from a developer, we will collect and maintain a service-specific identifier associated with the developer’s application in order to enable a service block since the Tapjoy services are not intended for children.
If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, you may contact us at tapjoy_privacy@unity3d.com and we will make reasonable efforts to delete the information from our records.
The GDPR Angle:
We do not collect or otherwise process personal data from individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland whom we know to be under the applicable age stated in the different implementations of the GDPR, except to comply with law or to support our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of our app developers partners as described above.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We may revise this privacy policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our processing of information and is posted at
https://dev.tapjoy.com/en/legal/Privacy-Policy
. If we make a change to this policy we will post the revised privacy policy to this page.
STATE PRIVACY RIGHTS
