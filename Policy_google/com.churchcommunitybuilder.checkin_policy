When we share your data, it may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country you live in – such as the United States, where our data hosting provider’s servers are located. The laws in the United States regarding personal information may be different from the laws of your jurisdiction. Any cross-border transfers of your personal data by us will comply with the safeguards required by applicable law. For further information about these international data transfer safeguards for individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom, and Switzerland, please see the section titled “For EEA, UK, and Swiss Users Only” below, and its sub-section “International Data Transfers (for EEA, UK, and Swiss Users Only)”.
FOR EEA, UK, AND SWISS USERS ONLY
Legal Basis (For EEA, UK, and Swiss Users Only)
If you are a visitor from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Where we collect personal data, we typically only process it:
to perform a contract with you;
when you provide consent;
where we have legitimate interests to process the personal data and they’re not overridden by your rights; or
in accordance with a legal obligation.
International Data Transfers (For EEA, UK, And Swiss Users Only)
For individuals in the EEA, UK, and/or Switzerland, your personal data will be transferred outside of your jurisdiction. Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, UK, and/or Switzerland, it will only be transferred to jurisdictions that have been identified as providing adequate protection for such personal data (like New Zealand), or under an approved data transfer mechanism such as Standard Contractual Clauses, or the EU-US, UK-US, or Swiss-US Data Privacy Frameworks.
EU-US, UK-US, and Swiss-US Data Privacy Frameworks
Church Community Builder (“CCB”) participates and complies with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (“EU-US DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-US DPF”), as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.
CCB has certified to the US Department of Commerce that it commits to comply with the EU-US DPF Principles with regards to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-US DPF, and from the United Kingdom in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. CCB has also certified to the US Department of Commerce that it commits to comply with the Swiss-US DPF Principles with regards to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-US DPF (collectively, the “DPF Principles”).
The DPF Principles are: Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability when processing such personal data. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern.
For more information about the DPF, and to view CCB’s certification, please visit:
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
CCB’s compliance with the DPF Principles is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
CCB is responsible for the processing of EEA, UK, and/or Swiss personal data it receives in the US which it then subsequently transfers to a third party acting as its agent. If such third party agent processes your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, then CCB will remain responsible for such third party, unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In certain situations, CCB may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have any questions or complaints about our DPF certification, please contact us using the details set out in the How to Contact Us section below.
In compliance with the DPF Principles, we commit to resolve DPF-related complaints within forty-five (45) days of receipt.
CCB has further committed to refer unresolved DPF complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
If neither CCB nor our designated independent recourse mechanism, JAMS, is able to resolve your DPF-related complaint, then an individual may, under certain conditions, be able to invoke binding arbitration for the resolution of your complaint. To find out more about the DPF’s binding arbitration scheme, please see

Residents of the State of California have the right to request information regarding third parties to whom companies have disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “personal information,” as well as rights to access and control personal information. The CCPA defines “personal information” to mean “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered publicly available information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a federal privacy law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
To the extent that we collect personal information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and our rights are described below.

We may share any of the above-listed information with service providers, which are external parties that we engage for business purposes and are restricted from using personal information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. The categories of service providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described in this Policy.

Church Community Builder is committed to providing you with the best security for your data. Our main goal is to make your entire community of users feel that we have done everything we can do to protect their information.
We Want Your Staff To Feel Secure
as they work with member data.
as they invite members and volunteer leaders to be a part of the online community.
as they communicate across the Internet.
We Want Your Members To Feel Secure
as they update their information (helping their church know when changes occur in their lives).
as they share information with staff, group leaders, and the community.
as they view and print their own contribution information.
We Want Your IT Professionals And Consultants To Feel Secure
by knowing we use a state-of-the-art Cloud Hosting Provider.
by knowing we use high-quality 256-bit SSL encryption to secure transmission of data.
by knowing we monitor inbound/outbound traffic daily to evaluate security risks.
by knowing your data is replicated in real-time to a separate, highly available data center hosted by our Cloud Hosting Provider, and your data is backed up nightly to a separate region of our Cloud Hosting Provider.
Hosting Platform
Your data is one of the most important aspects of the Church Community Builder Solution and we treat it as such. Having great security, resilience, and responsiveness in a solution is important, which is why we here at Church Community Builder have taken every effort to find the best way in which to host your data. The following details provide information about the capabilities provided by the Cloud Hosting Provider’s data centers where the Church Community Builder software is maintained and your live data is stored.
Access to data centers is limited to only authorized individuals, and only for the time which they need facility access.
Continuous monitoring for unauthorized facility access is performed via video surveillance, intrusion detection, and access log monitoring systems.
Audits of over 2600 requirements are performed by external auditors throughout the year to validate compliance with numerous regulatory programs.
Fully redundant power systems are built to ensure the availability of systems even in the event of a critical power failure.
Water leakage detection systems are implemented to prevent system damage and outages.
Climate control systems are in place to maintain acceptable temperatures for the servers, helping prevent system outages.
Multiple data centers within the same region with high speed, highly available connectivity between them, allowing for data and system availability, even through a full data center outage.
Highly available internet connectivity with scalable throughput.
Application Security
We recognize you are entrusting your data to Church Community Builder, and that it’s critical for your staff, volunteer ministry leaders, and members to have access to this data in a safe and secure manner.
Data Encryption
Church Community Builder uses high-grade 256-bit certificates and modern TLS to encrypt access to our application, regardless of whether it’s user logins, accessing user data, or processing financial transaction data. These enterprise-level certificates maintained through Digicert, provide assurance that your data is protected between our servers and your computer.
Account Security
On the user end, we require that all individual logins require at least one numeric and one alpha character and that their password must be at least six characters long to further ensure the security of the data. After five unsuccessful attempts at log in, a user’s account is automatically locked for a 60-minute period. Additionally, we also automatically log users out of sessions after six hours of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.
User Permissions
Church Community Builder was designed to give you control over how each person is able to access your data. This control can be done via standard user permissions such as a Limited Access User which cannot see any people in your database, a Basic User with the ability to see other listed individuals or a Small Group Leader with access to individuals and data in their groups. If these permissions don’t quite meet your needs, customized administrative users can be granted granular control with over 100 different areas of the application in which permissions can be configured.
Data Security
Hardware & Software
Security and reliability depend on great systems. Church Community Builder’s solution has been designed from the ground up to implement industry best practices ranging from least privilege to network segmentation. As part of this, security patches for operating systems and installed applications are updated regularly, and systems are also hardened by disabling non-essential services/ports and enabling secure configurations on the operating systems and installed applications.
In addition to building secure systems, we also implement some pretty cool tools to protect against threats to our systems and your data. One of these is a web application firewall (WAF). This tool is built to inspect connections coming into our systems and analyze it for malicious behavior. Depending on the type of threat, the WAF may then present the user a captcha, or if it’s too risky, it’ll simply block the traffic.
Another type of threat that service providers face is a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. These types of attacks may be performed in many ways, but ultimately result in an impact to the availability of a service. To combat this, we have implemented a tool to provide us DDOS protection. You can be confident that even when something attempts to cause a DDOS to Church Community Builder’s services, access to your data will still be functional.
Scalability
Church Community Builder’s critical services are hosted behind load balancers to enhance availability and throughput. One of the amazing characteristics of Church Community Builder’s software is its ability to scale automatically. As load increases on our software, systems are built to detect the need and power up additional resources to ensure that access to your data is still responsive. Don’t worry, each new resource that is powered up is secured in the same way as our other systems. When these systems automatically power down, there’s never any impact to your data.
Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance
When using Church Community Builder’s Payment portal, you can be confident that your payment information is secure. We engage with a third-party assessor annually to validate that our systems are implemented securely and comply with the PCI Data Security Standard. Components of this program include third-party penetration tests, vulnerability scanning, patching, security incident management, daily log review, alerts for critical events, and much more.

Backups
Church Community Builder utilizes multiple methods to ensure that your church’s data will be available to you when you need it. First, and most important, Church Community Builder replicates your data in realtime between resilient, secure environments in different data centers owned by our Cloud Hosting Provider. This ensures that if there is a disastrous outage at the primary data center hosting our services, even your most recent updates to data will still have been captured. Second, Church Community Builder also retains daily backups for weeks, and weekly backups for months, in a separate region provided by our Cloud Hosting Provider. In the event of a critical impact to an entire region for our Cloud Hosting Provider, your data will still be recoverable.
Data Ownership
Church Community Builder does not own or have any rights to any data that the customer submits as a result of using the service. Church Community Builder will not monitor, edit, or disclose any information regarding the customer or customer’s database without the customer’s express written permission except as may be required by law.
The Benefits of Software as a Service (SaaS)
Church Community Builder was built from the ground up to utilize the power of the Internet. Gone are the days when it was OK to have an assistant enter all of the church member data and create reports to get that information back out. Churches in today’s world need the ability to empower volunteer leaders to communicate instantly and dynamically and to build community. The traditional church management software cannot provide this; Church Community Builder can.
One of the additional benefits to utilizing Church Community Builder’s is a built-in Disaster Recovery plan, which would protect your data regardless of hardware issues, office fires, flooding, or other scenarios that might take place at your local church or data center. Any internet access, from any location, will give you access to your Church Community Builder software.
Lower Cost of Maintenance
Your church does not have to maintain the physical equipment or logical systems that ensure security, resilience, and responsiveness that exist when hosting a solution from your church office. Nor does the church have to put additional strain on their IT departments or volunteers to install and maintain applications or infrastructure.
No Cost For Updates
By using a hosted software, updates are automatically loaded to your application as they come available, ensuring that you have the latest version. No more manual upgrades or updates to infrastructure or software.

Who is Church Community Builder?
Church Community Builder provides a platform that churches use to connect and communicate with their community members, record member service history, facilitate online giving, and perform a range of administrative functions.  If your church uses our software, staff and leaders at your church are interacting with our software behind the scenes to help keep things running smoothly.

No matter what level of involvement you have with your church, at Church Community Builder we are committed to making sure your personal data is safe and secure.
What data does Church Community Builder store?
Churches use our software, in part, to help keep track of their people. That means that a church may use our systems to maintain names, addresses, contact information, family connections, or other types of information about their people. That might include some information about your attendance, volunteer history, or giving history with the church. If you have questions on what types of data your church is storing, reach out to your church’s office staff.
Who owns this data?

We are considered a “Processor” under Europe’s
General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), and a “Service Provider” under the
California Consumer Privacy Act
(CCPA). That legally obligates us to only share this data as necessary to provide our services, and to keep your data safe and secure using appropriate technical and organizational measures.
What are my rights?
Depending on where you live, you may have legal rights on how your church uses your personal data. Those rights might include things like:
The right to know what data is held on you
The right to have that data be accurate
The right to object to the processing of that data
The right to have that data deleted

Please contact your church community for information regarding their information collection, use, and retention practices.

International Data Transfers
When we share your data, it may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country you live in – such as the United States, where our data hosting provider’s servers are located. The laws in the United States regarding personal information may be different from the laws of your jurisdiction. Any cross-border transfers of your personal data by us will comply with the safeguards required by applicable law. For further information about these international data transfer safeguards for individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom, and Switzerland, please see the section titled “For EEA, UK, and Swiss Users Only” below, and its sub-section “International Data Transfers (for EEA, UK, and Swiss Users Only)”.
FOR EEA, UK, AND SWISS USERS ONLY
Legal Basis (For EEA, UK, and Swiss Users Only)
If you are a visitor from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Where we collect personal data, we typically only process it:
to perform a contract with you;
when you provide consent;
where we have legitimate interests to process the personal data and they’re not overridden by your rights; or
in accordance with a legal obligation.
International Data Transfers (For EEA, UK, And Swiss Users Only)
For individuals in the EEA, UK, and/or Switzerland, your personal data will be transferred outside of your jurisdiction. Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, UK, and/or Switzerland, it will only be transferred to jurisdictions that have been identified as providing adequate protection for such personal data (like New Zealand), or under an approved data transfer mechanism such as Standard Contractual Clauses, or the EU-US, UK-US, or Swiss-US Data Privacy Frameworks.
EU-US, UK-US, and Swiss-US Data Privacy Frameworks
Church Community Builder (“CCB”) participates and complies with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (“EU-US DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-US DPF”), as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.
CCB has certified to the US Department of Commerce that it commits to comply with the EU-US DPF Principles with regards to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-US DPF, and from the United Kingdom in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. CCB has also certified to the US Department of Commerce that it commits to comply with the Swiss-US DPF Principles with regards to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-US DPF (collectively, the “DPF Principles”).
The DPF Principles are: Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability when processing such personal data. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern.
For more information about the DPF, and to view CCB’s certification, please visit:
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
CCB’s compliance with the DPF Principles is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
CCB is responsible for the processing of EEA, UK, and/or Swiss personal data it receives in the US which it then subsequently transfers to a third party acting as its agent. If such third party agent processes your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, then CCB will remain responsible for such third party, unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In certain situations, CCB may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have any questions or complaints about our DPF certification, please contact us using the details set out in the How to Contact Us section below.
In compliance with the DPF Principles, we commit to resolve DPF-related complaints within forty-five (45) days of receipt.
CCB has further committed to refer unresolved DPF complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
If neither CCB nor our designated independent recourse mechanism, JAMS, is able to resolve your DPF-related complaint, then an individual may, under certain conditions, be able to invoke binding arbitration for the resolution of your complaint. To find out more about the DPF’s binding arbitration scheme, please see

Persons with disabilities may obtain this Policy in alternative format upon request by contacting us at
privacy@churchcommunitybuilder.com
or by calling +1 (866) 242-1199.
Residents of the State of California have the right to request information regarding third parties to whom companies have disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “personal information,” as well as rights to access and control personal information. The CCPA defines “personal information” to mean “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered publicly available information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a federal privacy law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
To the extent that we collect personal information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and our rights are described below.
Right To Information Regarding The Categories Of Personal Information Collected, Sold, And Disclosed
The following is a description of our data collection practices, including the personal information we collect, the sources of that information, the purposes for which we collect information, and whether we disclose that information to external parties. We may use any and all of the information for any of the purposes described in this Policy, unless limitations are listed. The categories we use to describe the information are those enumerated in the CCPA.
Personal Identifiers:
We collect your name, billing address, email address, and telephone number when you create an account, complete a transaction, or otherwise communicate with us. We collect your email address when you subscribe to our email list.
We collect your social media handle and basic account information when you interact with our Services through social media.
We collect a unique numerical identifier, assigned to you by a first-party cookie, automatically when you use our Services in order to identify you, provide the Services, keep you logged in to the Services, prevent fraud, and provide you with targeted information and offers.
We collect your payment information when you complete a transaction. You have the option to store this information to your account or set up a recurring transaction. We use this information to streamline and facilitate payments and transactions.
We do not collect your Social Security number, Driver’s License number, or Passport number.
We collect your IP address automatically when you use our Websites and Services. We may use this information to identify you, gauge online activity on our website, measure the effectiveness of online services, applications, and tools, and serve targeted advertisements based on your online activities.
We collect your Device ID automatically when you use our Websites and Services. We use this information to monitor your use and the effectiveness of our Services, to identify you, and to provide you with targeted information and offers.

When you engage in transactions with us, we create records of goods or services purchased or considered, as well as your purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.

We collect information about your browsing history, search history, information regarding your interaction with websites, and applications or advertisements automatically when you utilize our Websites or Services.

As described above, we collect your IP address automatically when you use our Services. We may be able to determine your general location based on your IP address. If you allow your device to provide us with this information, we use it to make improvements to our products and services, and to provide recommendations and deliver relevant advertising.
Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information:
If you contact us via phone, we may record the call. We will notify you if a call is being recorded at the beginning of the call. We do not collect thermal, olfactory, or other similar information.
Education information:
We do not collect any information about the institutions you have attended or the level of education you have attained.
Inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or characteristics:
We analyze your actual or likely preferences through a series of computer processes and add our observations to your internal profile. We use this information to gauge and develop our marketing activities, measure the appeal and effectiveness of our services, applications, and tools, and to provide you with targeted information, advertisements, and offers.
We may share any of the above-listed information with service providers, which are external parties that we engage for business purposes and are restricted from using personal information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. The categories of service providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described in this Policy.
We may also disclose information to other external parties who are not listed here when required by law or to protect our company or other persons, as described in this policy.
Right To Access Information
You have the right to request access to personal information collected about you and information regarding the source of that information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we share it. To protect your personal information, we will verify your identity before we act on your request.
Right To Request Deletion Of Information
You have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete any personal information that we have collected directly from you. To protect your personal information, we will verify your identity before we act on your request.
Right to Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA.
Right to Opt-Out of Sales

Church Community Builder is committed to providing you with the best security for your data. Our main goal is to make your entire community of users feel that we have done everything we can do to protect their information.
We Want Your Staff To Feel Secure

as they invite members and volunteer leaders to be a part of the online community.
as they communicate across the Internet.
We Want Your Members To Feel Secure
as they update their information (helping their church know when changes occur in their lives).
as they share information with staff, group leaders, and the community.
as they view and print their own contribution information.
We Want Your IT Professionals And Consultants To Feel Secure
by knowing we use a state-of-the-art Cloud Hosting Provider.
by knowing we use high-quality 256-bit SSL encryption to secure transmission of data.
by knowing we monitor inbound/outbound traffic daily to evaluate security risks.
by knowing your data is replicated in real-time to a separate, highly available data center hosted by our Cloud Hosting Provider, and your data is backed up nightly to a separate region of our Cloud Hosting Provider.
Hosting Platform
Your data is one of the most important aspects of the Church Community Builder Solution and we treat it as such. Having great security, resilience, and responsiveness in a solution is important, which is why we here at Church Community Builder have taken every effort to find the best way in which to host your data. The following details provide information about the capabilities provided by the Cloud Hosting Provider’s data centers where the Church Community Builder software is maintained and your live data is stored.
Access to data centers is limited to only authorized individuals, and only for the time which they need facility access.
Continuous monitoring for unauthorized facility access is performed via video surveillance, intrusion detection, and access log monitoring systems.
Audits of over 2600 requirements are performed by external auditors throughout the year to validate compliance with numerous regulatory programs.
Fully redundant power systems are built to ensure the availability of systems even in the event of a critical power failure.
Water leakage detection systems are implemented to prevent system damage and outages.
Climate control systems are in place to maintain acceptable temperatures for the servers, helping prevent system outages.
Multiple data centers within the same region with high speed, highly available connectivity between them, allowing for data and system availability, even through a full data center outage.
Highly available internet connectivity with scalable throughput.
Application Security
We recognize you are entrusting your data to Church Community Builder, and that it’s critical for your staff, volunteer ministry leaders, and members to have access to this data in a safe and secure manner.
Data Encryption
Church Community Builder uses high-grade 256-bit certificates and modern TLS to encrypt access to our application, regardless of whether it’s user logins, accessing user data, or processing financial transaction data. These enterprise-level certificates maintained through Digicert, provide assurance that your data is protected between our servers and your computer.
Account Security
On the user end, we require that all individual logins require at least one numeric and one alpha character and that their password must be at least six characters long to further ensure the security of the data. After five unsuccessful attempts at log in, a user’s account is automatically locked for a 60-minute period. Additionally, we also automatically log users out of sessions after six hours of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.
User Permissions
Church Community Builder was designed to give you control over how each person is able to access your data. This control can be done via standard user permissions such as a Limited Access User which cannot see any people in your database, a Basic User with the ability to see other listed individuals or a Small Group Leader with access to individuals and data in their groups. If these permissions don’t quite meet your needs, customized administrative users can be granted granular control with over 100 different areas of the application in which permissions can be configured.
Data Security
Hardware & Software
Security and reliability depend on great systems. Church Community Builder’s solution has been designed from the ground up to implement industry best practices ranging from least privilege to network segmentation. As part of this, security patches for operating systems and installed applications are updated regularly, and systems are also hardened by disabling non-essential services/ports and enabling secure configurations on the operating systems and installed applications.
In addition to building secure systems, we also implement some pretty cool tools to protect against threats to our systems and your data. One of these is a web application firewall (WAF). This tool is built to inspect connections coming into our systems and analyze it for malicious behavior. Depending on the type of threat, the WAF may then present the user a captcha, or if it’s too risky, it’ll simply block the traffic.
Another type of threat that service providers face is a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. These types of attacks may be performed in many ways, but ultimately result in an impact to the availability of a service. To combat this, we have implemented a tool to provide us DDOS protection. You can be confident that even when something attempts to cause a DDOS to Church Community Builder’s services, access to your data will still be functional.
Scalability
Church Community Builder’s critical services are hosted behind load balancers to enhance availability and throughput. One of the amazing characteristics of Church Community Builder’s software is its ability to scale automatically. As load increases on our software, systems are built to detect the need and power up additional resources to ensure that access to your data is still responsive. Don’t worry, each new resource that is powered up is secured in the same way as our other systems. When these systems automatically power down, there’s never any impact to your data.
Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance
When using Church Community Builder’s Payment portal, you can be confident that your payment information is secure. We engage with a third-party assessor annually to validate that our systems are implemented securely and comply with the PCI Data Security Standard. Components of this program include third-party penetration tests, vulnerability scanning, patching, security incident management, daily log review, alerts for critical events, and much more.
For more information on our commitment to you around PCI compliance, please feel free to check out our
PCI Compliance article

Backups
Church Community Builder utilizes multiple methods to ensure that your church’s data will be available to you when you need it. First, and most important, Church Community Builder replicates your data in realtime between resilient, secure environments in different data centers owned by our Cloud Hosting Provider. This ensures that if there is a disastrous outage at the primary data center hosting our services, even your most recent updates to data will still have been captured. Second, Church Community Builder also retains daily backups for weeks, and weekly backups for months, in a separate region provided by our Cloud Hosting Provider. In the event of a critical impact to an entire region for our Cloud Hosting Provider, your data will still be recoverable.
Data Ownership
Church Community Builder does not own or have any rights to any data that the customer submits as a result of using the service. Church Community Builder will not monitor, edit, or disclose any information regarding the customer or customer’s database without the customer’s express written permission except as may be required by law.
The Benefits of Software as a Service (SaaS)
Church Community Builder was built from the ground up to utilize the power of the Internet. Gone are the days when it was OK to have an assistant enter all of the church member data and create reports to get that information back out. Churches in today’s world need the ability to empower volunteer leaders to communicate instantly and dynamically and to build community. The traditional church management software cannot provide this; Church Community Builder can.
One of the additional benefits to utilizing Church Community Builder’s is a built-in Disaster Recovery plan, which would protect your data regardless of hardware issues, office fires, flooding, or other scenarios that might take place at your local church or data center. Any internet access, from any location, will give you access to your Church Community Builder software.
Lower Cost of Maintenance
Your church does not have to maintain the physical equipment or logical systems that ensure security, resilience, and responsiveness that exist when hosting a solution from your church office. Nor does the church have to put additional strain on their IT departments or volunteers to install and maintain applications or infrastructure.
No Cost For Updates
By using a hosted software, updates are automatically loaded to your application as they come available, ensuring that you have the latest version. No more manual upgrades or updates to infrastructure or software.

Who is Church Community Builder?
Church Community Builder provides a platform that churches use to connect and communicate with their community members, record member service history, facilitate online giving, and perform a range of administrative functions.  If your church uses our software, staff and leaders at your church are interacting with our software behind the scenes to help keep things running smoothly.

No matter what level of involvement you have with your church, at Church Community Builder we are committed to making sure your personal data is safe and secure.
What data does Church Community Builder store?
Churches use our software, in part, to help keep track of their people. That means that a church may use our systems to maintain names, addresses, contact information, family connections, or other types of information about their people.

If you have questions on what types of data your church is storing, reach out to your church’s office staff.

We are considered a “Processor” under Europe’s
General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), and a “Service Provider” under the
California Consumer Privacy Act
(CCPA). That legally obligates us to only share this data as necessary to provide our services, and to keep your data safe and secure using appropriate technical and organizational measures.
What are my rights?

The right to know what data is held on you
The right to have that data be accurate
The right to object to the processing of that data
The right to have that data deleted

Each Order Form will remain in effect for an initial term of one year, unless otherwise specified in the Order Form, beginning on the Effective Date identified on the Order Form (the “initial term”). Unless the parties agree to a longer renewal term, after the initial term, these terms and each Order Form will automatically renew on a month to month basis (each, monthly or longer renewal term, as applicable, a “renewal term”) until cancelled by either party on at least thirty days’ prior written notice.

In such event, Customer, as its sole and exclusive monetary remedy in connection with such termination, may elect to have refunded the price paid in advance (if any) for the remaining portion of the Agreement’s term for use of the Service (excluding any setup fees or data migration fees). Church Community Builder may terminate use on notice of the Service if Customer is a competitor of Church Community Builder and upon such termination shall refund a pro rata portion of the fees paid for the unused term of the Agreement.
XIX. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
Use of the Service and any reliance by Customer upon the Service, including any action taken by Customer because of such use or reliance, is at Customer’s sole risk.

XX. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
