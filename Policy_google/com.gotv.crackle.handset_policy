This Privacy Policy explains how CSS collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our Services such as our websites, applications, and other connected devices where our Services are available. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting our Sites, our Applications and using our Services, you agree that your information, including your personal information, will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this Terms of Use
https://www.chickensoup.com/terms-of-use
and

.
The privacy practices of third parties that host our Services are governed by their own privacy policies and are not governed by this privacy policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of those third parties. When you click on an advertisement in our Services, you are redirected to another website or property governed by its own privacy policy. We recommend that you review those privacy policies as well.
Consent to Processing in the United States
Many of our Services such as Crackle are only available in the United States. All users, including, without limitation, users in the member states of the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, fully understand and consent to this Privacy Policy. That means by using our Sites, participating in any of our Services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, use and processing of your personal information to and in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United States law, please note that you are transferring your personal information to the United States. The laws of some countries may not provide the same levels of protection of personal information as your home country, particularly if you are resident in the European Union. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that information about you is treated securely in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and that all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our service providers.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES TREAT YOUR INFORMATION IN A MANNER THAT MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM, AND LESS PROTECTIVE THAN, THE TREATMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH US, OR MAKE USE OF THESE WEBSITES.
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO REQUIRE US TO TREAT YOUR INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ANY COUNTRY OR JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING WAIVER MAY NOT BE LEGALLY BINDING IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. TO THE EXTENT IT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING IN THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, THIS FOREGOING WAIVER DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Collection of Information
CSS and/or its Service Providers, Contractors, and Third Parties (defined below), may collect Personal Information you provide directly to CSS and/or its Service Providers via the Service. "Personal Information" includes information that can identify, relate to, describe, be associated with, or be reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. For the purpose of this policy, we may use Personal Information and information synonymously.
CSS collects information when you use or register for the Service, subscribe to notifications, post on the Service, provide reviews and testimonials, participate in promotional activities, or communicate or transact with CSS through the Service. In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those third parties.
Information You Provide to Us
We collect the following categories of information:
Identifiers:
CSS may ask you to provide contact information such as name, email address, phone number, date of birth when you create an account on Crackle or Pivotshare, provide a testimonial, sign up for newsletters, the Crackle Rewards Program (available in the U.S. only), participate in surveys; contact customer service or communicate with us by other means. Certain content such as rewards, some features, and functionality can only be accessed with an account. It is necessary that CSS collects your account log-in information and password to verify your account and maintain the account. This data is not used to personalize content or advertisements.
Information Collected from Partners and Other Sources
The information CSS receives via the Service may be combined with information CSS receives from Third Parties and sources outside of the Service. CSS may collect information from other commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or our business partners, which may include your interests, purchasing behavior and your activities online, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed, if you connect your social networking account with your account. This aggregated data is non-identifiable about how you use our services. CSS may also obtain information about you from other sources, including companies’ affiliates. CSS is not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or for third party policies or practices.
Information Collected Automatically (Cookies and Tracking Technologies)
Internet or other electronic network activity information:
CSS, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, information about your use of the Service, and data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device), advertising IDs, cookies, and other technologies to keep track of your interactions with the Service, and to serve you with ads on third-party services, to offer you a more personalized and relevant experience. We may collect geolocation data in the form of an IP address to know the region from where you are accessing our Services. CSS does not collect precise geolocation data. You may see us refer to "Log Data." Log Information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files. We may link your Log Data with your account information or with information collected from third parties.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
: Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed ("Tracking Technologies") may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser.
Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from CSS’s web server, or from a third party with which CSS works and is active only while you are connected to the Service and deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other location- aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location.
Fingerprinting
Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes of identification and/or tracking.
Device Recognition Technologies
Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by CSS and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. See Section 10 regarding certain choices regarding these activities.
CSS is giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them explained in Section 10 so that your consent to encountering them is meaningfully informed.

● for web analytic purposes such as Google Analytics: we use Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to gather information about how users engage with the sites and the services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
. You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to

Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data practices from those
contained in this Privacy Policy. Please review those rules carefully;
● To CSS’s agents, vendors, consultants, processors and other service providers
(collectively "Service Providers") who may receive, or be given access to your information, including, without limitation, Personal Information, non-Personal Information, and Usage Information in connection with their work on CSS’s behalf, provided however, CSS does not authorize its Service Providers to use CSS-Collected PI provided by CSS to the Service Providers to send you direct marketing messages other than related to Crackle Plus Companies absent your consent.
● To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal process, and in response to a government request;
● If CSS believes your actions are inconsistent with CSS’s terms of use, user agreements, applicable terms or policies, or to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of CSS, the Service or its users, or any third party; and
● CSS may share your CSS-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information), in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of CSS assets or transfer of all or a portion of CSS’s business to another company ("Corporate Transactions").
INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS
The Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including Personal Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Service, your UGC will be considered "public" and will be accessible by anyone, including CSS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Personal Information included in UGC is not subject to CSS’s usage or sharing limitations, or other obligations, regarding CSS-Collected PI or other Personal Information under this Privacy Policy or otherwise, and may be used and shared by CSS and third parties to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law. CSS encourages you to exercise caution when making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas. For more information on how UGC is treated under the Service’s Terms of Use click here. California minors should see Section 8 regarding potential removal of certain UGC they have posted on the Service.
Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication to a friend. If so, CSS relies on you to only send to people that have given you permission to do so. The friend’s Personal Information you provide (e.g., name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication, but not used by CSS for any other marketing purpose unless CSS obtains consent from that person. Your contact information and message may be included in the communication.
THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ("Third-Party Service(s)". These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" CSS’s content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with us in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by our Companies. Also, both CSS and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
CSS may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting").
CSS may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without limitation, Google Analytics. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help CSS analyze Service users and how they use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other internet usage.
Except to the extent CSS combines information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other third parties with CSS-Collected PI, in which case CSS will treat the combined information as CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy (see Section 1(c)), data obtained by CSS from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to CSS’s limitations regarding
CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on CSS by the third party, if any . Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with CSS, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third-Party Services.
CSS is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third- Party Services associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. See Section 10 for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising and analytics.
Data Security
CSS takes reasonable measures to protect CSS-Collected PI (excluding UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and CSS cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.
To help protect you and others, CSS and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use related information including CSS- Collected PI and other Personal Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance with the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of CSS, their partners, and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Service.
Minors’ and Children’s Privacy
CSS offers to its users a range of sites and applications, some of which are intended for users and their families. CSS does not permit the registration of, nor does CSS knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII from anyone under 13 years of age (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") ("Children’s Personal Information").
Our channel, Popcornflix Kids, may automatically collect information such as IP address and watch time of shows if a child is watching from their own device to support internal operations such as to conduct research and analysis to address the performance of the platform, provide contextual advertising, and to provide access to content. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. We do not share this information with third parties. We may share information with our service providers if necessary, for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.
We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.
If you are using any of our other sites and you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to use these Services. If you are aware of anyone under the age of 13 using our other Sites, please notify us. Upon confirmation, we will terminate any account that a user may have, and we will eliminate any personal information we may have obtained from that user immediately.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe CSS has collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact CSS and CSS will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.

You can withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information at any time.
Tracking Options
Tracking Technologies Generally
You can control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from CSS by visiting
this form
.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-
player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or device manufacturer.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, CSS currently does not alter CSS’s practices when CSS receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit
https://allaboutdnt.com/
but CSS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. CSS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third-party choice notices or choice mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt- outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us, and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or web browsers or use a non- browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI /DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
CSS supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self- regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (
https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf
). CSS is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
Global Privacy Control
You may use an Opt-Out Preference Signal such as the Global Privacy Control ("GPC") to opt out of the sale/sharing of your personal information. GPC is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking. To find out more about and set up GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about
.
If you do not have an account, or are not logged into your account, your request to opt-out will be linked to your browser identifier only and not linked to your account. You may also opt out by using this form.

California Users
Shine the Light
CSS only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California’s "Shine the Light" law), with non-affiliated third parties (i.e., parties other than our affiliated Crackle Plus Companies) for their own direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in or are offered the opportunity to opt- out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide personal information or choose to participate in a feature on the Service. If you do not opt-in or if you opt- out at that time, CSS will not knowingly share the personal information that was collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes but may continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same or other non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from time-to-time. Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated separately so it is possible that you may consent to some sharing but not to others.
In addition, California residents may request information about CSS’ compliance with the Shine the Light law and the CSS Companies with which CSS may have shared personal information for their direct marketing purposes by contacting CSS here or by sending a letter to Crackle Plus, LLC at PO Box 700, Cos Cob, CT 06807 (Attention: Privacy Program, Information Security). Requests must include "California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that CSS is only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and CSS is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mail address.
California Privacy Notice
The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA"), and any implementing regulations provide California residents specific rights regarding personal information. CSS is providing this notice at or before the point of collection to explain whether we sell or share personal information, how long we retain data, and how we may use "sensitive personal information."
If you have a specific question or concern about your rights, or questions about our policy in support of your rights as a Californian consumer, please contact us through our email or mailing address in the "Questions about our Privacy Policy" section below. You may also submit a request

We obtain the categories of personal information from sources as described in the CSS Privacy Policy. We use and share personal information as described in the CSS Privacy Policy. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.
We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
The CCPA/CPRA provides California residents (consumers) with specific rights regarding their personal information. If you are a resident of California you have the right to request what information we collect, use, and disclose. This includes the categories of personal information and the specific pieces of personal information. You may also request the sources of personal information collected about you, the purpose for collecting the personal information. You also have the right to request that we delete your information or to correct your information.
The CCPA/CPRA also gives California residents the right to stop the "sale" or "sharing" of their personal information. CSS utilizes Tracking Technologies including for example, cookies and tracking pixels, that help us, and others better understand you and serve you more relevant content and ads. To opt out of certain Tracking Technologies, please see the Tracking Options Section of this Privacy Policy. CSS may sell or share your personal information such as online identifiers, internet protocol address, or other similar identifiers to our advertising partners. We may also sell or share internet or other Electronic Network Activity Information with our affiliates, advertising partners, data analytics providers, and audience measurement companies.
To opt out of sharing, you may set your browser GPC which is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking. To find out more about and set up GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about
. You may also contact us as described below or submit a request to us here. You can also opt-out of the sale of personal information that is automatically collected from our Sites by changing your preferences at any time by updating your "Cookies Settings’ available on our website.
We do not have actual knowledge that we sell any personal information of individuals under the age of 16.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. CSS does not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe we have collected information about your child, you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
● Deny you goods or services.
● Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
● Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
● Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. Notice of Financial Incentive and Right to Opt Out.
As described in the terms of service for the Crackle Rewards Program, when participants sign up for the Program, they agree to allow Crackle and its Program-related service providers ("Crackle"), to (i) collect personal information and information on your use of Crackle Rewards and (ii) share the information with our service providers, as defined our Privacy Policy, to facilitate participation in the Rewards Program. Crackle uses the information it collects through the Program to operate the Rewards Program. Under California law, Rewards Programs may be considered a financial incentive provided in exchange for the collection and retention of personal information.
While we do not assign a monetary value to the data that we collect, based on our reasonable estimate, the value received from the insights and the Program is reasonably equal to or greater than the value Crackle receives from the use of this information. To the extent that we provide programs that may be considered a financial incentive because the program is directly or reasonably related to the collection, deletion or retention of consumer personal information, the value is reasonably related to the overall value we receive from the personal information participants provide specific to the program minus the costs and expenses we incur in providing the program. Participation in our rewards program is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Please refer to our FAQs page to learn more about the rewards program.
You may opt out of the rewards program by going to the settings menu and toggling the button to read "opt-out". If a Participant opts-out of their Rewards Account, all of your data associated with your Rewards Account will be immediately and permanently deleted. Participants forfeit their Rewards Points and Sponsor will not be able to provide any customer service related to any previous transactions associated with their Rewards Account once a Participant has opted- out. If Participant elects to re-enroll in the Program after they have opted-out of their Rewards Account, they may do so, but will start with a zero Point balance. For more information about our Rewards Program, please see our FAQs.
CSS will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in CSS then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from CSS’ databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

. CSS is the data controller of information collected by our Services.
This Privacy Policy explains how CSS collects, uses, and shares
      information about you when you use our Services such as our websites,
      applications, and other connected devices where our Services are
      available. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting our
      Sites, our Applications and using our Services, you agree that your
      information, including your personal information, will be handled as
      described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into
      this Terms of Use
https://www.chickensoup.com/terms-of-use
and
https://crackle.com/tos
.
The privacy practices of third parties that host our Services are governed
      by their own privacy policies and are not governed by this privacy policy.
      We recommend that you review the privacy policies of those third parties.
      When you click on an advertisement in our Services, you are redirected to
      another website or property governed by its own privacy policy. We
      recommend that you review those privacy policies as well.
Consent to Processing in the United States
Our Services are operated in the United States. By providing any
      information to CSS, all users, including, without limitation, users in the
      member states of the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the
      United States, fully understand and consent to this Privacy Policy. That
      means by using our Sites, participating in any of our Services and/or
      providing us with your information, you consent to the collection,
      transfer, storage, use and processing of your personal information to and
      in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are
      visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data
      collection and use that may differ from United States law, please note
      that you are transferring your personal information to the United States.
      The laws of some countries may not provide the same levels of protection
      of personal information as your home country, particularly if you are
      resident in the European Union. We will take reasonable steps to ensure
      that information about you is treated securely in accordance with this
      Privacy Policy, and that all information you provide to us is stored on
      our secure servers or those of our service providers.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES TREAT YOUR INFORMATION
      IN A MANNER THAT MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM, AND LESS PROTECTIVE
      THAN, THE TREATMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND
      JURISDICTIONS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED TO THE
      UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH US, OR MAKE USE
      OF THESE WEBSITES.
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED,
      YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO REQUIRE US TO TREAT YOUR
      INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ANY COUNTRY OR JURISDICTION
      OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING WAIVER MAY NOT BE
      LEGALLY BINDING IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE MEMBER STATES OF THE
      EUROPEAN UNION. TO THE EXTENT IT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING IN THE COUNTRY IN
      WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, THIS FOREGOING WAIVER DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Collection of Information
CSS and/or its Service Providers, Contractors, and Third Parties (defined
      below), may collect Personal Information you provide directly to CSS
      and/or its Service Providers via the Service. "Personal Information"
      includes information that can identify, relate to, describe, be associated
      with, or be reasonably capable of being associated with, or could
      reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer
      or household. For the purpose of this policy, we may use Personal
      Information and information synonymously.
CSS collects information when you use or register for the Service,
      subscribe to notifications, post on the Service, provide reviews and
      testimonials, participate in promotional activities, or communicate or
      transact with CSS through the Service. In addition, when you interact with
      Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide
      information to those third parties.
Information You Provide to Us
We collect the following categories of information:
Identifiers:
CSS may ask you to provide contact
      information such as name, email address, phone number, date of birth when
      you create an account on Crackle or Pivotshare, provide a testimonial,
      sign up for newsletters, the Crackle Rewards Program (available in the
      U.S. only), participate in surveys; contact customer service or
      communicate with us by other means. Certain content such as rewards, some
      features, and functionality can only be accessed with an account.
Sensitive Personal Information
: At your option, CSS may
      collect sensitive personal information such as gender when you create an
      account. In addition, it is necessary that CSS collects your account
      log-in information and password to verify your account and maintain the
      account. This data is not used to personalize content or advertisements.
Information Collected from Partners and Other Sources
The information CSS receives via the Service may be combined with
      information CSS receives from Third Parties and sources outside of the
      Service. CSS may collect information from other commercially available
      sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or our business
      partners, which may include your interests, purchasing behavior and your
      activities online, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed, if
      you connect your social networking account with your account. This
      aggregated data is non-identifiable about how you use our services. CSS
      may also obtain information about you from other sources, including
      companies’ affiliates. CSS is not responsible or liable for the accuracy
      of the information provided by third parties or for third party policies
      or practices.
Information Collected Automatically (Cookies and Tracking Technologies)
Internet or other electronic network activity information:
CSS, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also
      automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use
      the Service ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include IP
      address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, information
      about your use of the Service, and data regarding network connected
      hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device), advertising IDs, cookies, and
      other technologies to keep track of your interactions with the Service,
      and to serve you with ads on third-party services, to offer you a more
      personalized and relevant experience. We may collect geolocation data in
      the form of an IP address to know the region from where you are accessing
      our Services. CSS does not collect precise geolocation data. You may see
      us refer to "Log Data." Log Information is data about your use of the
      Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider,
      referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related
      data, and may be stored in log files. We may link your Log Data with your
      account information or with information collected from third parties.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking
        Technologies
: Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded
      scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device
      recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking
      technologies now and hereafter developed ("Tracking Technologies") may be
      used to collect information about interactions with the Service or
      e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing
      behavior.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may
      be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier
      for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser.
Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "internet tags" or
      "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may
      be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the
      Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content
      views.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information
      about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded
      onto your computer from CSS’s web server, or from a third party with which
      CSS works and is active only while you are connected to the Service and
      deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other
      location- aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes
      such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content
      based on your location.
Fingerprinting
Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without
      limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data,
      for purposes of identification and/or tracking.
Device Recognition Technologies
Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data
      sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device
      use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions
      about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same
      user or household).
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in
      mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and
      cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or
      other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a
      particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third-Party
      Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and
      services and used by CSS and third parties for purposes such as to
      associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other
      content to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. See
      Section 10 regarding certain choices regarding these activities.
CSS is giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your choices
      regarding them explained in Section 10 so that your consent to
      encountering them is meaningfully informed.
Use of Information
CSS uses Personal Information to provide services, to enhance our
      services, to personalize our services and marketing efforts, to set up
      accounts, to administer rewards programs. For example, we may use Personal
      Information to:
Allow you to participate in the features we offer on the Service;
Facilitate, manage, personalize, and improve your online experience;
Process your registration and/or upload your User Generated Content
          ("UGC"). (For more information on how UGC is treated under the

          UGC, see Section 5);
Transact with you, provide services or information you request,
          respond to your comments, questions and requests, serve you content
          and/or advertising, and send you notices;

          terms, and threats or harm.
Sharing of Information
General Sharing
CSS may share the information CSS receives from or about you via the
      Service (or give others access to it), including your Personal
      Information, for a variety of purposes, as detailed in this Privacy
      Policy. CSS may share your non-Personal Information, aggregate and/or
      de-identified information about you except as prohibited by applicable
      law. These include, without limitation:
With our service providers to deliver and improve CSS’s services;
with outside companies that support customizing the advertising and
          marketing content you see. These marketing service providers allow us
          to to better market products and services to you;
with advertisers and advertising technology companies often with the
          ability to click-through to websites or properties owned by other
          companies. They may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies
          to collect information from or about you in order to tailor
          advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other
          enhancements;
for our own marketing and other purposes;
for web analytic purposes such as Google Analytics: we use Google
          Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to gather
          information about how users engage with the sites and the services.

          ("Facebook") that enable it to collect or receive information about
          actions users take on: (a) the CSS site and elsewhere on the internet
          through use of Cookies, Web Beacons and other storage technologies; or
          (b) our App and other mobile applications, in order to provide

. through the use of cookies, Web beacons, and other storage
          technologies;
to display your posts or send your messages;
in connection with your use of third-party services;
in connection with sweepstakes, contests and promotions. CSS may offer
          sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a "Promotion"),
          including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties,
          which may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily
          choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including Personal
          Information, may be disclosed to CSS, co-sponsors, Service Providers,
          and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as
          required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you are
          agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may
          include consent to additional or differing data practices from those
          contained in this Privacy Policy. Please review those rules carefully;
To CSS’s agents, vendors, consultants, processors and other service
          providers (collectively "Service Providers") who may receive, or be
          given access to your information, including, without limitation,
          Personal Information, non-Personal Information, and Usage Information
          in connection with their work on CSS’s behalf, provided however, CSS
          does not authorize its Service Providers to use CSS-Collected PI
          provided by CSS to the Service Providers to send you direct marketing
          messages other than related to Crackle Plus Companies absent your
          consent.
To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal process, and in
          response to a government request;
If CSS believes your actions are inconsistent with CSS’s terms of use,
          user agreements, applicable terms or policies, or to protect the
          rights, property, life, health, security and safety of CSS, the
          Service or its users, or any third party; and
CSS may share your CSS-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal
          Information and your non-Personal Information), in connection with or
          during negotiations of any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale,
          joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business
          combination of all or any portion of CSS assets or transfer of all or
          a portion of CSS’s business to another company ("Corporate
          Transactions").
INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS
The Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without
      limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings,
      computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including Personal
      Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the
      Service, your UGC will be considered "public" and will be accessible by
      anyone, including CSS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Personal
      Information included in UGC is not subject to CSS’s usage or sharing
      limitations, or other obligations, regarding CSS-Collected PI or other
      Personal Information under this Privacy Policy or otherwise, and may be
      used and shared by CSS and third parties to the fullest extent not
      prohibited by applicable law. CSS encourages you to exercise caution when
      making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas. For more
      information on how UGC is treated under the Service’s Terms of Use click
      here. California minors should see Section 8 regarding potential removal
      of certain UGC they have posted on the Service.
Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication
      to a friend. If so, CSS relies on you to only send to people that have
      given you permission to do so. The friend’s Personal Information you
      provide (e.g., name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the
      communication, but not used by CSS for any other marketing purpose unless
      CSS obtains consent from that person. Your contact information and message
      may be included in the communication.
THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection
      with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations,
      platforms, applications or services operated by third parties
      ("Third-Party Service(s)". These Third-Party Services may use their own
      cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently
      collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from
      you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you
      initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as
      third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social
      Features include enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos
      between the Service and a Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" CSS’s
      content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account
      (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise
      connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push
      information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and
      potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide
      access to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the Third-Party
      Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party
      Service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated
      with us in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in
      connection with the Service or otherwise by our Companies. Also, both CSS
      and the third party may have access to certain information about you and
      your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
CSS may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to
      serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some
      of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of
      the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as
      "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising"
      ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a
      Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting").
CSS may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without
      limitation, Google Analytics. These analytics services may use cookies and
      other Tracking Technologies to help CSS analyze Service users and how they
      use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP
      address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by
      these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these
      Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating
      your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s
      activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and
      other internet usage.
Except to the extent CSS combines information from Service Providers,
      Third-Party Services, or other third parties with CSS-Collected PI, in
      which case CSS will treat the combined information as CSS-Collected PI
      under this Privacy Policy (see Section 1(c)), data obtained by CSS from a
      third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to CSS’s
      limitations regarding CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however
      such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on CSS by the third
      party, if any . Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared
      by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices,
      including whether they continue to share information with CSS, the types
      of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on
      Third-Party Services.
CSS is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the
      policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without
      limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third- Party Services
      associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself
      with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. See Section 10
      for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their
      data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising
      and analytics.
Data Security
CSS takes reasonable measures to protect CSS-Collected PI (excluding UGC)
      from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration,
      and destruction.
Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are
      not completely secure and CSS cannot guarantee the security of your
      information collected through the Service.
To help protect you and others, CSS and its Service Providers may (but
      make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use
      related information including CSS-Collected PI and other Personal
      Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or
      inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, to
      identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and
      investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse
      of the Service; ensure compliance with the Terms of Use and this Privacy
      Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and
      otherwise to protect the rights and property of CSS, their partners, and
      customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and
      analysis of online activity or communications through our Service. If you
      do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the
      Service.
Minors’ and Children’s Privacy
CSS offers to its users a range of sites and applications, some of which
      are intended for users and their families. CSS does not permit the
      registration of, nor does CSS knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII from
      anyone under 13 years of age (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy
      Protection Act ("COPPA") ("Children’s Personal Information").
Our channel, Popcornflix Kids, may automatically collect information such
      as IP address and watch time of shows if a child is watching from their
      own device to support internal operations such as to conduct research and
      analysis to address the performance of the platform, provide contextual
      advertising, and to provide access to content. In any instance that we
      collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information
      only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or
      allow the child to continue to participate in the activity and ensure the
      security of our users and our services, or as required by law. We do not
      share this information with third parties. We may share information with
      our service providers if necessary, for them to perform a business,
      professional, or technology support function for us.
We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for
      example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent
      permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information
      collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public
      agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we
      believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an
      investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child
      using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or
      integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the
      technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions
      against liability.
We do not "sell" personal information of known minors under 16 years of
      age.
If you are using any of our other sites and you are under the age of 13,
      you are not permitted to use these Services. If you are aware of anyone
      under the age of 13 using our other Sites, please notify us. Upon
      confirmation, we will terminate any account that a user may have, and we
      will eliminate any personal information we may have obtained from that
      user immediately.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe CSS has collected Children’s
      Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact
      CSS and CSS will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.
Your Choices and Rights
Your Rights
If your region provides the right to do so, you can request for example,
      access, correction, and deletion of information we hold about you. If you

      have an account, you are able to update information in the "Settings" tab.
      If you have an account with us, CSS provides web pages and other
      mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the
      CSS-Collected PI, and potentially certain other information about you
      (e.g., profile and account information) within account settings.

For EU Residents
If you are an EU or UK resident, you have a number of rights when it comes
      to your personal information. Further information and advice about your
      rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country
      of residence within the EU or the UK.
You can exercise any of these rights by filling out
this form
or by contacting us through our email or mailing address in the "Contact
      CSS" section below.
The right to be informed.
You have the right to be
      provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information
      about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re
      providing you with the information in this Policy.
The right of access.
You have the right to obtain access
      to your information, and certain other information (similar to that
      provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you’re aware and can check
      that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.
The right to rectification.
You are entitled to have your
      information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
The right to erasure
. This is also known as ‘the right to
      be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or
      removal of your information where there is no compelling reason for us to
      keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are
      exceptions.
The right to restrict processing
. You have rights to
      ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is
      restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it
      further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their
      information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in
      future.
The right to data portability
. You have rights to obtain
      and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different
      services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this
      enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our
      IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its
      usability. This is not a general right however and there are exceptions.
The right to object to processing.
You have the right to
      object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct
      marketing (i.e., receiving emails from us notifying you about other
      services we provide which we think may be of interest to you or being
      contacted with varying potential opportunities). You may change your
      preferences regarding email or newsletters as described above.
The right to lodge a complaint
. You have a right to lodge
      a complaint with your local Data Protection Supervisory Authority or with
      the UK Information Commissioner’s Office:
https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public
.
The right to withdraw consent
. If you have given your
      consent to anything we do with your personal data (i.e., we rely on
      consent as a legal basis for processing your personal information), you
      have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do
      so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal data
      with your consent up to that point is unlawful). You can withdraw your
      consent to the processing of your personal information at any time.
Tracking Options
Tracking Technologies Generally
You can control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from
      CSS by visiting
this form
.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as
      part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the
      future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different
      functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also,
      tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash
      cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other
      Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to
      Adobe’s website
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-
player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html. Please be aware that if
      you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may
      not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit
      browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings
      and limitations.
App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage
      (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by
      uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from
      your operating system or device manufacturer.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not
      Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no
      consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in
      this context. Like many online services, CSS currently does not alter
      CSS’s practices when CSS receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s
      browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit
https://allaboutdnt.com/
but CSS is
      not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party
      information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding
      their Tracking Technologies. CSS is not responsible for the completeness
      or accuracy of third-party choice notices or choice mechanisms. For
      specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party
      analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google
      Analytics by going to
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by
      submitting opt- outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that
      perform advertising-related services for us, and our partners may
      participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s("DAA") Self-Regulatory
      Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can
      exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of
      these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative
      ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their
      members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds
      of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of
      ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer
      deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you
      will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other
      ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
      you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies,
      use of a different device or web browsers or use a non- browser-based
      method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI /DAA browser-based opt-out
      may not, or may no longer, be effective.
CSS supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self- regulatory Principles for Online
      Behavioral Advertising (
https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf
). CSS is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any
      third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their
      statements regarding their programs.
Global Privacy Control
You may use an Opt-Out Preference Signal such as the Global Privacy
      Control to opt out of the sale/sharing of your personal information.
If you do not have an account, or are not logged into your account, your
      request to opt-out will be linked to your browser identifier only and not
      linked to your account. You may also opt out by using
this form

      continue to send you non- promotional communications, such as those about
      your account, transactions, servicing, or CSS’s ongoing business
      relations.
Audience Measurement
The Service may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which

Changes to this Policy
CSS reserves the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any
      time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the
      revised Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Service indicates
      your consent to the Privacy Policy then posted. If you do not agree,
      discontinue use of the Service and uninstall Service downloads and
      applications. If you have a subscription to a Service offering, material
      changes to this Privacy Policy will only become effective with respect to

California Users
Shine the Light
CSS only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California’s
      "Shine the Light" law), with non-affiliated third parties (i.e., parties
      other than our affiliated Crackle Plus Companies) for their own direct
      marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in or are offered the
      opportunity to opt- out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the
      time you provide personal information or choose to participate in a
      feature on the Service. If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at that
      time, CSS will not knowingly share the personal information that was
      collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated
      third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes but may
      continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same or other
      non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from
      time-to-time. Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated
      separately so it is possible that you may consent to some sharing but not
      to others.
In addition, California residents may request information about CSS’
      compliance with the Shine the Light law and the CSS Companies with which
      CSS may have shared personal information for their direct marketing
      purposes by contacting CSS here or by sending a letter to Crackle Plus,
      LLC at PO Box 700, Cos Cob, CT 06807 (Attention: Privacy Program,
      Information Security). Requests must include "California Privacy Rights
      Request" in the first line of the description and include your name,
      street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that CSS is only
      required to respond to one request per customer each year, and CSS is not
      required to respond to requests made by means other than through the
      provided e-mail address or mail address.
California Privacy Notice
The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the California Privacy
      Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA"), and any implementing regulations provide
      California residents specific rights regarding personal information. CSS
      is providing this notice at or before the point of collection to explain
      whether we sell or share personal information, how long we retain data,
      and how we may use "sensitive personal information."
If you have a specific question or concern about your rights, or questions

We obtain the categories of personal information from sources as described
      in the CSS Privacy Policy. We use and share personal information as
      described in the CSS Privacy Policy. When we disclose personal information
      for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and
      requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential
      and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.
We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to
      fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer
      retention period is required or permitted by law.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
The CCPA/CPRA provides California residents (consumers) with specific
      rights regarding their personal information. If you are a resident of
      California you have the right to request what information we collect, use,
      and disclose. This includes the categories of personal information and the
      specific pieces of personal information. You may also request the sources
      of personal information collected about you, the purpose for collecting
      the personal information. You also have the right to request that we
      delete your information or to correct your information.
The CCPA/CPRA also gives California residents the right to stop the "sale"
      or "sharing" of their personal information. CSS utilizes Tracking
      Technologies including for example, cookies and tracking pixels, that help
      us, and others better understand you and serve you more relevant content
      and ads. To opt out of certain Tracking Technologies, please see the
Tracking Options
Section of this Privacy
      Policy. CSS may sell or share your personal information such as online
      identifiers, internet protocol address, or other similar identifiers to
      our advertising partners. We may also sell or share internet or other
      Electronic Network Activity Information with our affiliates, advertising
      partners, data analytics providers, and audience measurement companies.
You have the right to opt-out of this sale of your personal information.
To do so, please contact us as described below or submit a request to us
here
. You can also opt-out of the sale of personal information that is
      automatically collected from our Sites by changing your preferences at any
      time by updating your ‘Cookies Settings’ available on our website.
We do not have actual knowledge that we sell any personal information of
      individuals under the age of 16.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State
      that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
      request related to your personal information. CSS does not knowingly
      collect information from children. If you believe we have collected
      information about your child, you may also make a verifiable consumer
      request on behalf of your child. You may only make a verifiable consumer
      request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are
      the person we collected personal information or an authorized
      representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly
      understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request
      or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity
      or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information
      relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you
      to create an account with us. We will only use personal information
      provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's
      identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of
      its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you
      of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with
      us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures
      we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
      consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the
      reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer
      request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
      determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made
      that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
      request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA
      rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including
          through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or
          services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
Notice of Financial Incentive and Right to Opt Out
As described in the
terms of service
for the Crackle Rewards Program, when participants sign up for the
      Program, they agree to allow Crackle and its Program-related service
      providers ("Crackle"), to (i) collect personal information and information
      on your use of Crackle Rewards and (ii) share the information with our
      service providers, as defined our Privacy Policy, to facilitate
      participation in the Rewards Program. Crackle uses the information it
      collects through the Program to operate the Rewards Program. Under
      California law, Rewards Programs may be considered a financial incentive
      provided in exchange for the collection and retention of personal
      information.
While we do not assign a monetary value to the data that we collect, based
      on our reasonable estimate, the value received from the insights and the
      Program is reasonably equal to or greater than the value Crackle receives
      from the use of this information. To the extent that we provide programs
      that may be considered a financial incentive because the program is
      directly or reasonably related to the collection, deletion or retention of
      consumer personal information, the value is reasonably related to the
      overall value we receive from the personal information participants
      provide specific to the program minus the costs and expenses we incur in
      providing the program. Participation in our rewards program is voluntary
      and you can withdraw at any time. Please refer to
our FAQs page
to learn
      more about the rewards program.
You may opt out of the rewards program by going to the settings menu and
      toggling the button to read "opt-out". If a Participant opts-out of their
      Rewards Account, all of your data associated with your Rewards Account
      will be immediately and permanently deleted. Participants forfeit their
      Rewards Points and Sponsor will not be able to provide any customer
      service related to any previous transactions associated with their Rewards
      Account once a Participant has opted-out. If Participant elects to
      re-enroll in the Program after they have opted-out of their Rewards
      Account, they may do so, but will start with a zero Point balance. For
      more information about our Rewards Program, please see our
FAQs
.
CSS will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in CSS
      then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always
      possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or
      public postings from CSS’ databases and residual and/or cached data may
      remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data
      (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably
      necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to
      the extent prohibited by applicable law. To submit individual right’s

This Privacy Policy explains how CSS collects, uses, and shares
      information about you when you use our Services such as our websites,
      applications, and other connected devices where our Services are
      available. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting our
      Sites, our Applications and using our Services, you agree that your
      information, including your personal information, will be handled as
      described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into

The privacy practices of third parties that host our Services are governed
      by their own privacy policies and are not governed by this privacy policy.
      We recommend that you review the privacy policies of those third parties.
      When you click on an advertisement in our Services, you are redirected to
      another website or property governed by its own privacy policy. We
      recommend that you review those privacy policies as well.
Consent to Processing in the United States
Our Services are operated in the United States. By providing any
      information to CSS, all users, including, without limitation, users in the
      member states of the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the
      United States, fully understand and consent to this Privacy Policy. That
      means by using our Sites, participating in any of our Services and/or
      providing us with your information, you consent to the collection,
      transfer, storage, use and processing of your personal information to and
      in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are
      visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data
      collection and use that may differ from United States law, please note
      that you are transferring your personal information to the United States.
      The laws of some countries may not provide the same levels of protection
      of personal information as your home country, particularly if you are
      resident in the European Union. We will take reasonable steps to ensure
      that information about you is treated securely in accordance with this
      Privacy Policy, and that all information you provide to us is stored on
      our secure servers or those of our service providers.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES TREAT YOUR INFORMATION
      IN A MANNER THAT MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM, AND LESS PROTECTIVE
      THAN, THE TREATMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND
      JURISDICTIONS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED TO THE
      UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH US, OR MAKE USE
      OF THESE WEBSITES.
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED,
      YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO REQUIRE US TO TREAT YOUR
      INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ANY COUNTRY OR JURISDICTION
      OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING WAIVER MAY NOT BE
      LEGALLY BINDING IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE MEMBER STATES OF THE
      EUROPEAN UNION. TO THE EXTENT IT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING IN THE COUNTRY IN
      WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, THIS FOREGOING WAIVER DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Collection of Information
CSS and/or its Service Providers, Contractors, and Third Parties (defined
      below), may collect Personal Information you provide directly to CSS
      and/or its Service Providers via the Service. “Personal Information”
      includes information that can identify, relate to, describe, be associated
      with, or be reasonably capable of being associated with, or could
      reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer
      or household. For the purpose of this policy, we may use Personal
      Information and information synonymously.
CSS collects information when you use or register for the Service,
      subscribe to notifications, post on the Service, provide reviews and
      testimonials, participate in promotional activities, or communicate or
      transact with CSS through the Service. In addition, when you interact with
      Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide
      information to those third parties.
Information You Provide to Us
We collect the following categories of information:
Identifiers:
CSS may ask you to provide contact
      information such as name, email address, phone number, date of birth when
      you create an account on Crackle or Pivotshare, provide a testimonial,
      sign up for newsletters, the Crackle Rewards Program (available in the
      U.S. only), participate in surveys; contact customer service or
      communicate with us by other means. Certain content such as rewards, some
      features, and functionality can only be accessed with an account.
Sensitive Personal Information
: At your option, CSS may
      collect sensitive personal information such as gender when you create an
      account. In addition, it is necessary that CSS collects your account
      log-in information and password to verify your account and maintain the
      account. This data is not used to personalize content or advertisements.
Information Collected from Partners and Other Sources
The information CSS receives via the Service may be combined with
      information CSS receives from Third Parties and sources outside of the
      Service. CSS may collect information from other commercially available
      sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or our business
      partners, which may include your interests, purchasing behavior and your
      activities online, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed, if
      you connect your social networking account with your account. This
      aggregated data is non-identifiable about how you use our services. CSS
      may also obtain information about you from other sources, including
      companies’ affiliates. CSS is not responsible or liable for the accuracy
      of the information provided by third parties or for third party policies
      or practices.
Information Collected Automatically (Cookies and Tracking Technologies)
Internet or other electronic network activity information:
CSS, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also
      automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use
      the Service ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include IP
      address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, information
      about your use of the Service, and data regarding network connected
      hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device), advertising IDs, cookies, and
      other technologies to keep track of your interactions with the Service,
      and to serve you with ads on third-party services, to offer you a more
      personalized and relevant experience. We may collect geolocation data in
      the form of an IP address to know the region from where you are accessing
      our Services. CSS does not collect precise geolocation data. You may see
      us refer to “Log Data.” Log Information is data about your use of the
      Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider,
      referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related
      data, and may be stored in log files. We may link your Log Data with your
      account information or with information collected from third parties.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking
        Technologies
: Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded
      scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device
      recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking
      technologies now and hereafter developed ("Tracking Technologies") may be
      used to collect information about interactions with the Service or
      e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing
      behavior.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may
      be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier
      for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser.
Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "internet tags" or
      "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may
      be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the
      Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content
      views.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information
      about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded
      onto your computer from CSS’s web server, or from a third party with which
      CSS works and is active only while you are connected to the Service and
      deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other
      location- aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes
      such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content
      based on your location.
Fingerprinting
Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without
      limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data,
      for purposes of identification and/or tracking.
Device Recognition Technologies
Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data
      sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device
      use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions
      about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same
      user or household).
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in
      mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and
      cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or
      other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a
      particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third-Party
      Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and
      services and used by CSS and third parties for purposes such as to
      associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other
      content to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. See
      Section 10 regarding certain choices regarding these activities.
CSS is giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your choices
      regarding them explained in Section 10 so that your consent to
      encountering them is meaningfully informed.
Use of Information
CSS uses Personal Information to provide services, to enhance our
      services, to personalize our services and marketing efforts, to set up
      accounts, to administer rewards programs. For example, we may use Personal
      Information to:
Allow you to participate in the features we offer on the Service;
Facilitate, manage, personalize, and improve your online experience;
Process your registration and/or upload your User Generated Content
          ("UGC"). (For more information on how UGC is treated under the
          Service’s Terms of Use click here. For more on the public nature of
          UGC, see Section 5);
Transact with you, provide services or information you request,
          respond to your comments, questions and requests, serve you content
          and/or advertising, and send you notices;

CSS may share the information CSS receives from or about you via the
      Service (or give others access to it), including your Personal
      Information, for a variety of purposes, as detailed in this Privacy
      Policy. CSS may share your non-Personal Information, aggregate and/or
      de-identified information about you except as prohibited by applicable
      law. These include, without limitation:
With our service providers to deliver and improve CSS’s services;
with outside companies that support customizing the advertising and
          marketing content you see. These marketing service providers allow us
          to to better market products and services to you;
with advertisers and advertising technology companies often with the
          ability to click-through to websites or properties owned by other
          companies. They may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies
          to collect information from or about you in order to tailor
          advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other
          enhancements;
for our own marketing and other purposes;
for web analytic purposes such as Google Analytics: we use Google
          Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to gather
          information about how users engage with the sites and the services.
          For more information about Google Analytics, please visit
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
. You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data
          generated by your use of the Services by going to
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
Facebook: we may use certain tools offered by Facebook, Inc.
          (“Facebook”) that enable it to collect or receive information about
          actions users take on: (a) the CSS site and elsewhere on the internet
          through use of Cookies, Web Beacons and other storage technologies; or
          (b) our App and other mobile applications, in order to provide
          measurement services, targeted ads and other services. For more
          information regarding the collection and use of such information by
          Facebook, please see the Facebook Data Policy available at
https://www.facebook.com/policy.php
. through the use of cookies, Web beacons, and other storage
          technologies;
to display your posts or send your messages;
in connection with your use of third-party services;
in connection with sweepstakes, contests and promotions. CSS may offer
          sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a "Promotion"),
          including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties,
          which may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily
          choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including Personal
          Information, may be disclosed to CSS, co-sponsors, Service Providers,
          and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as
          required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you are
          agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may
          include consent to additional or differing data practices from those
          contained in this Privacy Policy. Please review those rules carefully;
To CSS’s agents, vendors, consultants, processors and other service
          providers (collectively "Service Providers") who may receive, or be
          given access to your information, including, without limitation,
          Personal Information, non-Personal Information, and Usage Information
          in connection with their work on CSS’s behalf, provided however, CSS
          does not authorize its Service Providers to use CSS-Collected PI
          provided by CSS to the Service Providers to send you direct marketing
          messages other than related to Crackle Plus Companies absent your
          consent.
To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal process, and in
          response to a government request;
If CSS believes your actions are inconsistent with CSS’s terms of use,
          user agreements, applicable terms or policies, or to protect the
          rights, property, life, health, security and safety of CSS, the
          Service or its users, or any third party; and
CSS may share your CSS-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal
          Information and your non-Personal Information), in connection with or
          during negotiations of any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale,
          joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business
          combination of all or any portion of CSS assets or transfer of all or
          a portion of CSS’s business to another company ("Corporate
          Transactions").
INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS
The Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without
      limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings,
      computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including Personal
      Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the
      Service, your UGC will be considered "public" and will be accessible by
      anyone, including CSS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Personal
      Information included in UGC is not subject to CSS’s usage or sharing
      limitations, or other obligations, regarding CSS-Collected PI or other
      Personal Information under this Privacy Policy or otherwise, and may be
      used and shared by CSS and third parties to the fullest extent not
      prohibited by applicable law. CSS encourages you to exercise caution when
      making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas. For more
      information on how UGC is treated under the Service’s Terms of Use click
      here. California minors should see Section 8 regarding potential removal
      of certain UGC they have posted on the Service.
Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication
      to a friend. If so, CSS relies on you to only send to people that have
      given you permission to do so. The friend’s Personal Information you
      provide (e.g., name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the
      communication, but not used by CSS for any other marketing purpose unless
      CSS obtains consent from that person. Your contact information and message
      may be included in the communication.
THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection
      with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations,
      platforms, applications or services operated by third parties
      ("Third-Party Service(s)". These Third-Party Services may use their own
      cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently
      collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from
      you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you
      initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as
      third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social
      Features include enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos
      between the Service and a Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" CSS’s
      content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account
      (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise
      connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push
      information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and
      potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide
      access to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the Third-Party
      Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party
      Service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated
      with us in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in
      connection with the Service or otherwise by our Companies. Also, both CSS
      and the third party may have access to certain information about you and
      your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
CSS may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to
      serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some
      of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of
      the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as
      "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising"
      ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a
      Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting").
CSS may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without
      limitation, Google Analytics. These analytics services may use cookies and
      other Tracking Technologies to help CSS analyze Service users and how they
      use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP
      address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by
      these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these
      Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating
      your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s
      activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and
      other internet usage.
Except to the extent CSS combines information from Service Providers,
      Third-Party Services, or other third parties with CSS-Collected PI, in
      which case CSS will treat the combined information as CSS-Collected PI
      under this Privacy Policy (see Section 1(c)), data obtained by CSS from a
      third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to CSS’s
      limitations regarding CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however
      such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on CSS by the third
      party, if any . Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared
      by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices,
      including whether they continue to share information with CSS, the types
      of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on
      Third-Party Services.
CSS is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the
      policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without
      limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third- Party Services
      associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself
      with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. See Section 10
      for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their
      data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising
      and analytics.
Data Security
CSS takes reasonable measures to protect CSS-Collected PI (excluding UGC)
      from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration,
      and destruction.
Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are
      not completely secure and CSS cannot guarantee the security of your
      information collected through the Service.
To help protect you and others, CSS and its Service Providers may (but
      make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use
      related information including CSS-Collected PI and other Personal
      Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or
      inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, to
      identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and
      investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse
      of the Service; ensure compliance with the Terms of Use and this Privacy
      Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and
      otherwise to protect the rights and property of CSS, their partners, and
      customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and
      analysis of online activity or communications through our Service. If you
      do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the
      Service.
Minors’ and Children’s Privacy
CSS offers to its users a range of sites and applications, some of which
      are intended for users and their families. CSS does not permit the
      registration of, nor does CSS knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII from
      anyone under 13 years of age (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy
      Protection Act ("COPPA") ("Children’s Personal Information").
Our channel, Popcornflix Kids, may automatically collect information such
      as IP address and watch time of shows if a child is watching from their
      own device to support internal operations such as to conduct research and
      analysis to address the performance of the platform, provide contextual
      advertising, and to provide access to content. In any instance that we
      collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information
      only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or
      allow the child to continue to participate in the activity and ensure the
      security of our users and our services, or as required by law. We do not
      share this information with third parties. We may share information with
      our service providers if necessary, for them to perform a business,
      professional, or technology support function for us.
We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for
      example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent
      permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information
      collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public
      agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we
      believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an
      investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child
      using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or
      integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the
      technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions
      against liability.
We do not “sell” personal information of known minors under 16 years of
      age.
If you are using any of our other sites and you are under the age of 13,
      you are not permitted to use these Services. If you are aware of anyone
      under the age of 13 using our other Sites, please notify us. Upon
      confirmation, we will terminate any account that a user may have, and we
      will eliminate any personal information we may have obtained from that
      user immediately.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe CSS has collected Children’s
      Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact
      CSS and CSS will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.

      to your personal information. Further information and advice about your
      rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country
      of residence within the EU or the UK.
You can exercise any of these rights by filling out

      CSS" section below.
The right to be informed.

      provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information
      about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re
      providing you with the information in this Policy.
The right of access.
You have the right to obtain access
      to your information, and certain other information (similar to that
      provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you’re aware and can check
      that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.
The right to rectification.
You are entitled to have your
      information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
The right to erasure
. This is also known as ‘the right to
      be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or
      removal of your information where there is no compelling reason for us to
      keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are
      exceptions.
The right to restrict processing
. You have rights to
      ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is
      restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it
      further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their
      information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in
      future.
The right to data portability
. You have rights to obtain
      and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different
      services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this
      enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our
      IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its
      usability. This is not a general right however and there are exceptions.
The right to object to processing.
You have the right to
      object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct
      marketing (i.e., receiving emails from us notifying you about other

.
The right to withdraw consent
. If you have given your
      consent to anything we do with your personal data (i.e., we rely on
      consent as a legal basis for processing your personal information), you
      have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do
      so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal data
      with your consent up to that point is unlawful). You can withdraw your
      consent to the processing of your personal information at any time.
Tracking Options
Tracking Technologies Generally
You can control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from
      CSS by visiting
this form
.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as
      part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the
      future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different
      functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also,
      tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash
      cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other
      Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to
      Adobe’s website
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html
. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some
      parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service
      your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to
      your browser settings and limitations.
App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage
      (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by
      uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from
      your operating system or device manufacturer.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not
      Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no
      consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in
      this context. Like many online services, CSS currently does not alter
      CSS’s practices when CSS receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s
      browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit
https://allaboutdnt.com/
but CSS is
      not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party
      information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding
      their Tracking Technologies. CSS is not responsible for the completeness
      or accuracy of third-party choice notices or choice mechanisms. For
      specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party
      analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google
      Analytics by going to
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by
      submitting opt- outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that
      perform advertising-related services for us, and our partners may
      participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s("DAA") Self-Regulatory
      Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can
      exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of
      these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative
      ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their
      members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds
      of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of
      ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer
      deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you
      will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other
      ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
      you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies,
      use of a different device or web browsers or use a non- browser-based
      method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI /DAA browser-based opt-out
      may not, or may no longer, be effective.
CSS supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self- regulatory Principles for Online
      Behavioral Advertising (
https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf
). CSS is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any
      third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their
      statements regarding their programs.

      receiving promotional communications, CSS may, subject to applicable law,
      continue to send you non- promotional communications, such as those about
      your account, transactions, servicing, or CSS’s ongoing business
      relations.

Changes to this Policy
CSS reserves the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any
      time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the
      revised Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Service indicates
      your consent to the Privacy Policy then posted. If you do not agree,
      discontinue use of the Service and uninstall Service downloads and
      applications. If you have a subscription to a Service offering, material

California Users
Shine the Light
CSS only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California’s
      "Shine the Light" law), with non-affiliated third parties (i.e., parties
      other than our affiliated Crackle Plus Companies) for their own direct
      marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in or are offered the
      opportunity to opt- out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the
      time you provide personal information or choose to participate in a
      feature on the Service. If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at that
      time, CSS will not knowingly share the personal information that was
      collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated
      third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes but may
      continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same or other
      non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from
      time-to-time. Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated
      separately so it is possible that you may consent to some sharing but not
      to others.
In addition, California residents may request information about CSS’
      compliance with the Shine the Light law and the CSS Companies with which
      CSS may have shared personal information for their direct marketing
      purposes by contacting CSS here or by sending a letter to Crackle Plus,
      LLC at PO Box 700, Cos Cob, CT 06807 (Attention: Privacy Program,
      Information Security). Requests must include "California Privacy Rights
      Request" in the first line of the description and include your name,
      street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that CSS is only
      required to respond to one request per customer each year, and CSS is not
      required to respond to requests made by means other than through the
      provided e-mail address or mail address.
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents
      specific rights regarding personal information. These rights have been
      described in the Supplemental Privacy Policy. If you have a specific
      question or concern about your rights, or questions about our policy in
      support of your rights as a Californian consumer, please contact us
      through our email or mailing address in the “Questions about our Privacy
      Policy” section below.
California Consumers under CCPA (“California Statement”) explains rights
      that California consumers may have under the California Consumer Privacy
      Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).
When we use the term “personal information” in this supplemental
      California Statement, we are using that term as CCPA defines it, which
      CCPA generally defines “personal information” to mean information that
      identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or
      could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular
      consumer or household. However, personal information does not include
      publicly available, de-identified, or aggregate consumer information
      (which are all defined in CCPA). Notably, the definition of “personal
      information” also does not apply to the collection of personal information
      from job applicants, employees – whether you are our employee or any
      employee of the entity arranging access to our Services for you, business
      owners, directors, officers, staff, or contractors.
AS A BUSINESS UNDER CCPA
Where we act as a “business” under CCPA (meaning we determine the manner
      and reasons for why we process your personal information), we may be
      required to disclose the categories of personal information we collect,
      the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we
      collect that information, and who we share that information – all of which
      depends on the specific Service.
A. Identifiers.
A real name, alias, unique personal identifier, online identifier,
            Internet Protocol address, email address, or other similar
            identifiers. Testimonials and reviews.

            all users
B. Personal information categories listed in the California Customer
            Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)).

            license or state identification card number, insurance policy
            number, education, employment, employment history, bank account
            number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other
            financial information, medical information, or health insurance
            information. Some personal information included in this category may
            overlap with other categories.

            federal law.

            or tendencies.

Genetic, physiological, behavioral, and biological characteristics,
            or activity patterns used to extract a template or other identifier

            voiceprints, iris or retina scans, keystroke, gait, or other
            physical patterns, and sleep, health, or exercise data.
No.

            disciplinary records.
No.
We obtain the categories of personal information from sources as described
      in the CSS Privacy Policy. We use and share personal information as
      described in the CSS Privacy Policy. When we disclose personal information
      for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and
      requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential
      and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.
YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
The CCPA provides California residents (consumers) with specific rights
      regarding their personal information. If you are a resident of California
      and are not a job applicant, employee, or employee of another company
      interacting with us in your job role, you have the right to request what
      information we collect, use, and disclose. This includes the categories of
      personal information and the specific pieces of personal information. You
      may also request the sources of personal information collected about you,
      the purpose for collecting the personal information. You also have the
      right to request that we delete your information. To submit other
      individual right’s requests that apply in your region, please click here.
The CCPA also gives California residents the right to stop the “sale” of
      their personal information. Based on the current draft CCPA regulations,
      amendments, and modifications CSS does not "sell" your Personal
      Information. CSS utilizes Tracking Technologies including for example,
      cookies and tracking pixels, that help us, and others better understand
      you and serve you more relevant content and ads. To opt out of certain
      Tracking Technologies, please see Section 11 of this Privacy Policy.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State
      that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
      request related to your personal information. CSS does not knowingly
      collect information from children. If you believe we have collected
      information about your child, you may also make a verifiable consumer
      request on behalf of your child. You may only make a verifiable consumer
      request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are
      the person we collected personal information or an authorized
      representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly
      understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request
      or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity
      or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information
      relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you
      to create an account with us. We will only use personal information
      provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's
      identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of
      its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you
      of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with
      us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures
      we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
      consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the
      reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer
      request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
      determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made
      that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
      request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA
      rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including
          through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or
          services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

Sub-policy 2
https://www.crackle.com/privacy/privacy-policy-2021-12-01.html:
FULL PRIVACY POLICY
Thank you for visiting an online service (e.g., website or mobile app) that posts a link to this Privacy Policy ("Service") owned or operated by Chicken Soup for the Soul, LLC or one of its family of companies (collectively, "CSS"). This Privacy Policy will provide you with information as to how CSS collects, uses, and shares information about you, including the choices CSS offers with respect to that information, and applies to your use of any Service, regardless of how you access or use it. It does not apply to CSS’s data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of the Service (unless otherwise stated below or at the time of collection). For certain Services, there may be additional notices about information practices and choices. Please read those additional privacy disclosures to understand how they apply to you.
If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. To learn more about your California privacy rights, visit https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/privacy-laws. To further define how the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (
CCPA
) impacts CSS, we have a
Supplemental Privacy Statement for California Consumers
.
By visiting or otherwise using the Service, you agree to the Service’s
Terms of Use
and consent to CSS’s collection, use, and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy, and any additional privacy statements that may be posted on an applicable part of the Service (including any Children’s Privacy Policy). If you do not agree and consent, please discontinue use of the Service, and uninstall Service downloads and applications.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
Information You Provide
CSS, and/or its Service Providers (defined below), may collect information you provide directly to CSS and/or its Service Providers via the Service. For example, CSS collects information when you use or register for the Service, subscribe to notifications, post on the Service, provide reviews and testimonials, participate in promotional activities, or communicate or transact with CSS through the Service. In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those third parties. For more information on Third-Party Services’ data collection and practices refer to
Section 6
. For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices refer to
Section 3
.
Information CSS, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party Services may collect: personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, and address, ("Personal Information"); and (2) non-Personal information, such as (to the extent permitted by applicable law) your gender, age, interests, and recent and upcoming purchases ("non-Personal Information"). In addition, Personal
Information, including, without limitation, CSS-Collected PI (defined below), once "de- identified" (i.e., the removal of personal identifiers from data to make it no longer personally identifiable) is also non-Personal Information and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law. To the extent any non- Personal Information is combined by or on behalf of CSS with Personal Information CSS itself collects directly from you on the Service ("CSS-Collected PI"), CSS will treat the combined data as CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy
Information Collected Automatically (Cookies and Tracking Technologies)
CSS, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, information about your use of the Service, and data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device). Except to the extent defined by applicable law, or to the extent Usage Information is combined by or on behalf of CSS with CSS- Collected PI, CSS does not consider Usage Information (including, without limitation, device identifiers) to be Personal Information or CSS- Collected PI. CSS considers IP address to be PI. For more information on Third-Party Services’ data collection and practices, refer to
Section 6
. For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices, refer to
Section 10
. For information on choices some of these third parties may offer you regarding automated data collection, refer to
Section 10
.
The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:
Log Information: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed ("Tracking Technologies") may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser.
Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from CSS’s web server, or from a third party with which CSS works and is active only while you are connected to the Service and deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other location- aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location.
Fingerprinting
Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes of identification and/or tracking.
Device Recognition Technologies
Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by CSS and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. See
Section 10
regarding certain choices regarding these activities.
CSS is giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them explained in
Section 10
so that your consent to encountering them is meaningfully informed.
Information CSS Collects from Partners and Other Sources
Crackle may also obtain information about you from other sources, including Crackle’s and Crackle’s parent and related companies’ affiliates ("Crackle Plus Companies"), Service Providers and Third- Party Services solely as allowed by law, and combine that with CSS- Collected PI. Such third- party-sourced, or non-Service-sourced, information (including Personal Information) will only be treated as CSS-Collected PI to the extent it is combined with CSS-Collected PI. CSS is not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or for third party policies or practices.
USE OF INFORMATION

SHARING OF INFORMATION
CSS may share non-Personal Information, and Personal Information that is not deemed CSS- Collected PI hereunder
                (provided that CSS is aware of no restrictions on CSS’s use, if any), with third parties or Crackle Plus Companies and
                their affiliates for the purposes defined in this Policy. CSS may share the information CSS receives from or about you
                via the Service (or give others access to it), including your Personal Information, for a variety of purposes. These
                include, without limitation:
with our service providers to deliver and improve CSS’s services;
with outside companies that support customizing the advertising and marketing content you see. These marketing service providers allow us to to better market products and services to you;

They may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information from or about you in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements;
for CSS Companies’ (defined below) marketing and other purposes;
for web analytic purposes such as Google Analytics:  we use Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc.

Section 5
.
in connection with your use of third-party services refer to
Section 6
, and
in connection with sweepstakes, contests and promotions refer to
Section 4
.
CSS’s sharing of CSS-Collected PI is, however, subject to the following:
Marketing
: While on the Service, you may have the opportunity to consent (which may be by opt-in or election not to opt-out) to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of CSS-Collected PI with a third party. Absent your consent (which may be by means of third-party interaction described in the next bullet point), however, CSS will not share your CSS- Collected PI with third parties, other than Crackle Plus Companies, for their own direct marketing purposes, except in connection with Corporate Transactions (defined below).
Your Disclosure or Consent
: As more fully described in
Section 5
(Information You Disclose Publicly or to Others) and
Section 6
(Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics), your activities on the Service may, by their nature, result in the sharing of your CSS-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information) with third parties, and by engaging in these activities you consent to that and further sharing and disclosure to third parties.Such third-party data receipt and collection is subject to the privacy and business practices of that third party, not CSS.
CSS may also share any information about you (including, without limitation, CSS- Collected PI) for any purposes not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, or otherwise not prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation:
To CSS’s agents, vendors, consultants, processors and other service providers (collectively "Service Providers") who may receive, or be given access to your information, including, without limitation, Personal Information, non-Personal Information, and Usage Information in connection with their work on CSS’s behalf, provided however, CSS does not authorize its Service Providers to use CSS-Collected PI provided by CSS to the Service Providers to send you direct marketing messages other than related to Crackle Plus Companies absent your consent. For more information on choices Service Providers may offer refer to
Section 10
.
To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal process, and in response to a government request;
If CSS believes your actions are inconsistent with CSS’s terms of use, user agreements, applicable terms or policies, or to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of CSS, the Service or its users, or any third party; and
CSS may share your CSS-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information), in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of CSS assets or transfer of all or a portion of CSS’s business to another company ("Corporate Transactions").
SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, AND PROMOTIONS
CSS may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a "Promotion"), including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties, which may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including Personal Information, may be disclosed to CSS, co-sponsors, Service Providers, and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data practices from those contained in this Privacy Policy.
Please review those rules carefully.
INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS
The Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including Personal Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Service, your UGC will be considered "public" and will be accessible by anyone, including CSS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Personal Information included in UGC is not subject to CSS’s usage or sharing limitations, or other obligations, regarding CSS-Collected PI or other Personal Information under this Privacy Policy or otherwise, and may be used and shared by CSS and third parties to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law. CSS encourages you to exercise caution when making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas. For more information on how UGC is treated under the Service’s Terms of Use click
here
. California minors should see
Section 8
regarding potential removal of certain UGC they have posted on the Service.
Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication to a friend. If so, CSS relies on you to only
              send to people that have given you permission to do so. The friend’s Personal Information you provide (e.g., name,
              e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication, but not used by CSS for any other marketing purpose unless
              CSS obtains consent from that person. Your contact information and message may be included in the communication.
THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ("Third-Party Service(s)". These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" CSS’s content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service (see
Section 5
) or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Crackle Plus Companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by Crackle Plus Companies. Also, both CSS and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
CSS may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting").
CSS may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without limitation, Google Analytics. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help CSS analyze Service users and how they use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other internet usage.
Except to the extent CSS combines information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other third parties with CSS-Collected PI, in which case CSS will treat the combined information as CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy (see
Section 1(c)
), data obtained by CSS from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to CSS’s limitations regarding CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on CSS by the third party, if any . Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with CSS, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third-Party Services.
CSS is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third- Party Services associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. See
Section 10
for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising and analytics.
DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING
CSS takes reasonable measures to protect CSS-Collected PI (excluding UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and CSS cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.
To help protect you and others, CSS and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use related information including CSS-Collected PI and other Personal Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance with the
Terms of Use
and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of CSS, their partners, and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Service.
MINORS & CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
CSS offers to its users a range of sites and applications, some of which are intended for users and their families. CSS does not permit the registration of, nor does CSS knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII from anyone under 13 years of age (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") ("Children’s Personal Information").
Our platform, Popcornflix Kids, may automatically collect information such as IP address and watch time of shows if a child is watching from their own device to support internal operations such as to conduct research and analysis to address the performance of the platform, provide contextual advertising, and to provide access to content. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law.
We may share information with our service providers if necessary, for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.
We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.
We do not “sell” personal information of known minors under 16 years of age.
If you are using any of our other sites and you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to use these Services. If you are aware of anyone under the age of 13 using our other Sites, please notify us. Upon confirmation, we will terminate any account that a user may have, and we will eliminate any personal information we may have obtained from that user immediately.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe CSS has collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please
contact CSS
and CSS will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.
YOUR CHOICES AND YOUR RIGHTS
If you have an account with us, CSS provides web pages and other mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the CSS-Collected PI, and potentially certain other information about you (e.g., profile and account information).
California Privacy Rights
CSS only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California’s "Shine the Light" law), with non-affiliated third parties (i.e., parties other than our affiliated Crackle Plus Companies) for their own direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in or are offered the opportunity to opt- out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide personal information or choose to participate in a feature on the Service. If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at that time, CSS will not knowingly share the personal information that was collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes but may continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same or other non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from time-to-time. Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated separately so it is possible that you may consent to some sharing but not to others.
In addition, California residents may request information about CSS’ compliance with the Shine the Light law and the CSS Companies with which CSS may have shared personal information for their direct marketing purposes by contacting CSS
in section 13
or by sending a letter to Crackle Plus, LLC at PO Box 700, Cos Cob, CT 06807 (Attention: Privacy Program, Information Security). Requests must include "California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that CSS is only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and CSS is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mail address.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents specific rights regarding personal information. These rights have been described in the
Supplemental Privacy Policy
. If you have a specific question or concern about your rights, or questions about our policy in support of your rights as a Californian consumer, please contact us through our email or mailing address in the “Questions about our Privacy Policy” section below.
For EU Residents
Under EU Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council; the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal information. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country of residence within the EU. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us through our email or mailing address in the "

" section below:
The right to be informed. You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Policy.
The right of access. You have the right to obtain access to your information, and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.
The right to rectification. You are entitled to have your information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
The right to erasure. This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.
The right to restrict processing. You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.
The right to data portability. You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability. This is not a general right however and there are exceptions.
The right to object to processing. You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (i.e., receiving emails from us notifying you about other services we provide which we think may be of interest to you or being contacted with varying potential opportunities). You may change your preferences regarding email or newsletters as described above.
The right to lodge a complaint. You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.
The right to withdraw consent. If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data (i.e., we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal information), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal data with your consent up to that point is unlawful). You can withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information at any time.
CSS will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in CSS then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from CSS’ databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS
Tracking Technologies Generally
You can control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from CSS by visiting our LINK TO CCM.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website http://helpx.adobe.com/flash- player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or device manufacturer.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, CSS currently does not alter CSS’s practices when CSS receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit https://allaboutdnt.com/ but CSS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. CSS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third-party choice notices or choice mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt- outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us, and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or web browsers or use a non- browser-based method of access (e.g., mobileapp), your NAI /DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
CSS supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self- regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf). CSS is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
Other Platforms: You may also opt-out of targeted advertising on specific devices using the instructions below:
Amazon Fire TV: Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Preferences' > 'Privacy' and disable "Interest Based Ads" and select "Reset Advertising ID"
AppleTV: Navigate to 'Settings' > 'General' > 'Privacy' > 'Advertising' and enable "Limit Ad Tracking" and select "Reset advertising Identifier"
Roku: Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Privacy' > 'Advertising' and enable "Limit Ad Tracking" and select "Reset Advertising Identifier..."

Vizio TV: Navigate to 'HDTV Settings app' > 'System' > 'Reset & Admin' > Highlight 'Viewing Data' > Press right arrow to change the setting to "Off"
Mobile Apps
With respect to CSS’ mobile apps ("apps"), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of the app by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. See also the prior section regarding the DAA’s mobile Interest-based Advertising choices.
For example:
Android Phone/Tablet: Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Privacy' > 'Ads' and enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization" and select "Reset Advertising ID"
Apple Phone/Tablet: Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Privacy' > 'Advertising' and enable "Limit Ad Tracking" and select "Reset Advertising Identifier..."
Communications

CSS Supplemental Privacy Policy for California Consumers under CCPA
INTRODUCTION
This Supplemental Privacy Policy for California Consumers under CCPA (“California Statement”) explains rights that California consumers may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).
When we use the term “personal information” in this supplemental California Statement, we are using that term as CCPA defines it, which CCPA generally defines “personal information” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. However, personal information does not include publicly available, de-identified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in CCPA). Notably, the definition of “personal information” also does not apply to the collection of personal information from job applicants, employees – whether you are our employee or any employee of the entity arranging access to our Services for you, business owners, directors, officers, staff, or contractors.
AS A BUSINESS UNDER CCPA
Where we act as a “business” under CCPA (meaning we determine the manner and reasons for why we process your personal information), we may be required to disclose the categories of personal information we collect, the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we collect that information, and who we share that information – all of which depends on the specific Service.
Category
Examples
Collected
A. Identifiers.
A real name, alias, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, or other
                  similar identifiers. Testimonials and reviews.
Yes
B. Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)).
A name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport
                  number, driver's license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment
                  history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical
                  information, or health insurance information. Some personal information included in this category may overlap with other
                  categories.
Yes for name only.
C. Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law.
Age (40 years or older), race, color, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, religion or creed, marital status, medical condition, physical or mental disability, sex (including gender, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy or childbirth and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, veteran or military status, genetic information (including familial genetic information).
Yes for age and gender.
D. Commercial information.
Records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.
Yes, for videos watched on service.
E. Biometric information.
Genetic, physiological, behavioral, and biological characteristics, or activity patterns used to extract a template or other identifier or identifying information, such as, fingerprints, faceprints, and voiceprints, iris or retina scans, keystroke, gait, or other physical patterns, and sleep, health, or exercise data.
No.
F. Internet or other similar network activity.
Browsing history, search history, information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application, or advertisement.

Physical location or movements.
Yes.
H. Sensory data.
Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information.
No.
I. Professional or employment-related information.
Current or past job history or performance evaluations.
No.
J. Non-public education information (per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. Section 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99)).
Education records directly related to a student maintained by an educational institution or party acting on its behalf, such as grades, transcripts, class lists, student schedules, student identification codes, student financial information, or student disciplinary records.
No.
We obtain the categories of personal information from sources as described in the CSS Privacy Policy. We use and share personal information as described in the CSS Privacy Policy. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.
YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
The CCPA provides California residents (consumers) with specific rights regarding their personal information. If you are a resident of California and are not a job applicant, employee, or employee of another company interacting with us in your job role, you have the right to request what information we collect, use, and disclose. This includes the categories of personal information and the specific pieces of personal information. You may also request the sources of personal information collected about you, the purpose for collecting the personal information. You also have the right to request that we delete your information. To submit other individual right’s requests that apply in your region, please click here.
The CCPA also gives California residents the right to stop the “sale” of their personal information. Based on the current draft CCPA regulations, amendments, and modifications CSS does not "sell" your Personal Information. CSS utilizes Tracking Technologies including for example, cookies and tracking pixels, that help us, and others better understand you and serve you more relevant content and ads. To opt out of certain Tracking Technologies, please see Section 11 of this Privacy Policy.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. CSS does not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe we have collected information about your child, you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

Sub-policy 3
https://www.crackle.com/privacy/privacy-policy-2021-06-05.html:
FULL PRIVACY POLICY
Thank you for visiting an online service (e.g., website or mobile app) that posts a link to this Privacy Policy ("Service") owned or operated by Chicken Soup for the Soul, LLC or one of its family of companies (collectively, "CSS"). This Privacy Policy will provide you with information as to how CSS collects, uses, and shares information about you, including the choices CSS offers with respect to that information, and applies to your use of any Service, regardless of how you access or use it. It does not apply to CSS’s data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of the Service (unless otherwise stated below or at the time of collection). For certain Services, there may be additional notices about information practices and choices. Please read those additional privacy disclosures to understand how they apply to you.
If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. To learn more about your California privacy rights, visit https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/privacy-laws. To further define how the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (
CCPA
) impacts CSS, we have a
Supplemental Privacy Statement for California Consumers
.
By visiting or otherwise using the Service, you agree to the Service’s
Terms of Use
and consent to CSS’s collection, use, and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy, and any additional privacy statements that may be posted on an applicable part of the Service (including any Children’s Privacy Policy). If you do not agree and consent, please discontinue use of the Service, and uninstall Service downloads and applications.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
Information You Provide
CSS, and/or its Service Providers (defined below), may collect information you provide directly to CSS and/or its Service Providers via the Service. For example, CSS collects information when you use or register for the Service, subscribe to notifications, post on the Service, provide reviews and testimonials, participate in promotional activities, or communicate or transact with CSS through the Service. In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those third parties. For more information on Third-Party Services’ data collection and practices refer to
Section 6
. For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices refer to
Section 3
.
Information CSS, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party Services may collect: personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, and address, ("Personal Information"); and (2) non-Personal information, such as (to the extent permitted by applicable law) your gender, age, interests, and recent and upcoming purchases ("non-Personal Information"). In addition, Personal
Information, including, without limitation, CSS-Collected PI (defined below), once "de- identified" (i.e., the removal of personal identifiers from data to make it no longer personally identifiable) is also non-Personal Information and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law. To the extent any non- Personal Information is combined by or on behalf of CSS with Personal Information CSS itself collects directly from you on the Service ("CSS-Collected PI"), CSS will treat the combined data as CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy
Information Collected Automatically (Cookies and Tracking Technologies)
CSS, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, information about your use of the Service, and data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device). Except to the extent defined by applicable law, or to the extent Usage Information is combined by or on behalf of CSS with CSS- Collected PI, CSS does not consider Usage Information (including, without limitation, device identifiers) to be Personal Information or CSS- Collected PI. CSS considers IP address to be PI. For more information on Third-Party Services’ data collection and practices, refer to
Section 6
. For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices, refer to
Section 10
. For information on choices some of these third parties may offer you regarding automated data collection, refer to
Section 10
.
The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:
Log Information: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed ("Tracking Technologies") may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser.
Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from CSS’s web server, or from a third party with which CSS works and is active only while you are connected to the Service and deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other location- aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location.
Fingerprinting
Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes of identification and/or tracking.
Device Recognition Technologies
Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by CSS and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. See
Section 10
regarding certain choices regarding these activities.
CSS is giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them explained in
Section 10
so that your consent to encountering them is meaningfully informed.
Information CSS Collects from Partners and Other Sources
Crackle may also obtain information about you from other sources, including Crackle’s and Crackle’s parent and related companies’ affiliates ("Crackle Plus Companies"), Service Providers and Third- Party Services solely as allowed by law, and combine that with CSS- Collected PI. Such third- party-sourced, or non-Service-sourced, information (including Personal Information) will only be treated as CSS-Collected PI to the extent it is combined with CSS-Collected PI. CSS is not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or for third party policies or practices.
USE OF INFORMATION
CSS may use information about you, including CSS-collected PI and other Personal Information, for any purposes consistent with CSS’s statements under this Privacy Policy and not prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation, the following:
Allow you to participate in the features we offer on the Service;
Facilitate, manage, personalize, and improve your online experience;

                (provided that CSS is aware of no restrictions on CSS’s use, if any), with third parties or Crackle Plus Companies and
                their affiliates for the purposes defined in this Policy. CSS may share the information CSS receives from or about you
                via the Service (or give others access to it), including your Personal Information, for a variety of purposes. These
                include, without limitation:

CSS’s sharing of CSS-Collected PI is, however, subject to the following:
Marketing
: While on the Service, you may have the opportunity to consent (which may be by opt-in or election not to opt-out) to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of CSS-Collected PI with a third party. Absent your consent (which may be by means of third-party interaction described in the next bullet point), however, CSS will not share your CSS- Collected PI with third parties, other than Crackle Plus Companies, for their own direct marketing purposes, except in connection with Corporate Transactions (defined below).
Your Disclosure or Consent
: As more fully described in
Section 5
(Information You Disclose Publicly or to Others) and
Section 6
(Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics), your activities on the Service may, by their nature, result in the sharing of your CSS-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information) with third parties, and by engaging in these activities you consent to that and further sharing and disclosure to third parties.Such third-party data receipt and collection is subject to the privacy and business practices of that third party, not CSS.
CSS may also share any information about you (including, without limitation, CSS- Collected PI) for any purposes not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, or otherwise not prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation:
To CSS’s agents, vendors, consultants, processors and other service providers (collectively "Service Providers") who may receive, or be given access to your information, including, without limitation, Personal Information, non-Personal Information, and Usage Information in connection with their work on CSS’s behalf, provided however, CSS does not authorize its Service Providers to use CSS-Collected PI provided by CSS to the Service Providers to send you direct marketing messages other than related to Crackle Plus Companies absent your consent. For more information on choices Service Providers may offer refer to
Section 10
.
To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal process, and in response to a government request;
If CSS believes your actions are inconsistent with CSS’s terms of use, user agreements, applicable terms or policies, or to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of CSS, the Service or its users, or any third party; and
CSS may share your CSS-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information), in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of CSS assets or transfer of all or a portion of CSS’s business to another company ("Corporate Transactions").
SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, AND PROMOTIONS
CSS may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a "Promotion"), including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties, which may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including Personal Information, may be disclosed to CSS, co-sponsors, Service Providers, and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data practices from those contained in this Privacy Policy.
Please review those rules carefully.
INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS
The Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including Personal Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Service, your UGC will be considered "public" and will be accessible by anyone, including CSS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Personal Information included in UGC is not subject to CSS’s usage or sharing limitations, or other obligations, regarding CSS-Collected PI or other Personal Information under this Privacy Policy or otherwise, and may be used and shared by CSS and third parties to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law. CSS encourages you to exercise caution when making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas. For more information on how UGC is treated under the Service’s Terms of Use click
here
. California minors should see
Section 8
regarding potential removal of certain UGC they have posted on the Service.
Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication to a friend. If so, CSS relies on you to only
              send to people that have given you permission to do so. The friend’s Personal Information you provide (e.g., name,
              e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication, but not used by CSS for any other marketing purpose unless
              CSS obtains consent from that person. Your contact information and message may be included in the communication.
THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ("Third-Party Service(s)". These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" CSS’s content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service (see
Section 5
) or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Crackle Plus Companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by Crackle Plus Companies. Also, both CSS and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
CSS may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting").
CSS may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without limitation, Google Analytics. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help CSS analyze Service users and how they use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other internet usage.
Except to the extent CSS combines information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other third parties with CSS-Collected PI, in which case CSS will treat the combined information as CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy (see
Section 1(c)
), data obtained by CSS from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to CSS’s limitations regarding CSS-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on CSS by the third party, if any . Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with CSS, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third-Party Services.
CSS is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third- Party Services associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. See
Section 10
for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising and analytics.
DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING
CSS takes reasonable measures to protect CSS-Collected PI (excluding UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and CSS cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.
To help protect you and others, CSS and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use related information including CSS-Collected PI and other Personal Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance with the
Terms of Use
and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of CSS, their partners, and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Service.
MINORS & CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
CSS offers to its users a range of sites and applications, some of which are intended for users and their families. CSS does not permit the registration of, nor does CSS knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII from anyone under 13 years of age (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") ("Children’s Personal Information").
Our platform, Popcornflix Kids, may automatically collect information such as IP address and watch time of shows if a child is watching from their own device to support internal operations such as to conduct research and analysis to address the performance of the platform, provide contextual advertising, and to provide access to content. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law.
We may share information with our service providers if necessary, for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.
We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.
We do not “sell” personal information of known minors under 16 years of age.
If you are using any of our other sites and you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to use these Services. If you are aware of anyone under the age of 13 using our other Sites, please notify us. Upon confirmation, we will terminate any account that a user may have, and we will eliminate any personal information we may have obtained from that user immediately.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe CSS has collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please
contact CSS
and CSS will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.
YOUR CHOICES AND YOUR RIGHTS
If you have an account with us, CSS provides web pages and other mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the CSS-Collected PI, and potentially certain other information about you (e.g., profile and account information).
California Privacy Rights
CSS only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California’s "Shine the Light" law), with non-affiliated third parties (i.e., parties other than our affiliated Crackle Plus Companies) for their own direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in or are offered the opportunity to opt- out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide personal information or choose to participate in a feature on the Service. If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at that time, CSS will not knowingly share the personal information that was collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes but may continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same or other non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from time-to-time. Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated separately so it is possible that you may consent to some sharing but not to others.
In addition, California residents may request information about CSS’ compliance with the Shine the Light law and the CSS Companies with which CSS may have shared personal information for their direct marketing purposes by contacting CSS
here
or by sending a letter to Crackle Plus, LLC at PO Box 700, Cos Cob, CT 06807 (Attention: Privacy Program, Information Security). Requests must include "California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that CSS is only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and CSS is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mail address.

The right to be informed. You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Policy.
The right of access. You have the right to obtain access to your information, and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.
The right to rectification. You are entitled to have your information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
The right to erasure. This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.
The right to restrict processing. You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.
The right to data portability. You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability. This is not a general right however and there are exceptions.
The right to object to processing. You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (i.e., receiving emails from us notifying you about other services we provide which we think may be of interest to you or being contacted with varying potential opportunities). You may change your preferences regarding email or newsletters as described above.
The right to lodge a complaint. You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.
The right to withdraw consent. If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data (i.e., we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal information), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal data with your consent up to that point is unlawful). You can withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information at any time.
CSS will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in CSS then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from CSS’ databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS
Tracking Technologies Generally
You can control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from CSS by visiting our LINK TO CCM.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website http://helpx.adobe.com/flash- player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or device manufacturer.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, CSS currently does not alter CSS’s practices when CSS receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit https://allaboutdnt.com/ but CSS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. CSS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third-party choice notices or choice mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt- outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us, and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or web browsers or use a non- browser-based method of access (e.g., mobileapp), your NAI /DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
CSS supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self- regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf). CSS is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

Mobile Apps
With respect to CSS’ mobile apps ("apps"), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of the app by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. See also the prior section regarding the DAA’s mobile Interest-based Advertising choices.
For example:
Android Phone/Tablet: Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Privacy' > 'Ads' and enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization" and select "Reset Advertising ID"
Apple Phone/Tablet: Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Privacy' > 'Advertising' and enable "Limit Ad Tracking" and select "Reset Advertising Identifier..."

CSS Supplemental Privacy Policy for California Consumers under CCPA
INTRODUCTION
This Supplemental Privacy Policy for California Consumers under CCPA (“California Statement”) explains rights that California consumers may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).
When we use the term “personal information” in this supplemental California Statement, we are using that term as CCPA defines it, which CCPA generally defines “personal information” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. However, personal information does not include publicly available, de-identified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in CCPA). Notably, the definition of “personal information” also does not apply to the collection of personal information from job applicants, employees – whether you are our employee or any employee of the entity arranging access to our Services for you, business owners, directors, officers, staff, or contractors.
AS A BUSINESS UNDER CCPA
Where we act as a “business” under CCPA (meaning we determine the manner and reasons for why we process your personal information), we may be required to disclose the categories of personal information we collect, the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we collect that information, and who we share that information – all of which depends on the specific Service.
Category
Examples
Collected
A. Identifiers.
A real name, alias, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, or other
                  similar identifiers. Testimonials and reviews.

B. Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)).
A name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport
                  number, driver's license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment
                  history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical
                  information, or health insurance information. Some personal information included in this category may overlap with other
                  categories.
Yes for name only.
C. Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law.
Age (40 years or older), race, color, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, religion or creed, marital status, medical condition, physical or mental disability, sex (including gender, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy or childbirth and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, veteran or military status, genetic information (including familial genetic information).
Yes for age and gender.
D. Commercial information.
Records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.
Yes, for videos watched on service.
E. Biometric information.

Education records directly related to a student maintained by an educational institution or party acting on its behalf, such as grades, transcripts, class lists, student schedules, student identification codes, student financial information, or student disciplinary records.
No.
We obtain the categories of personal information from sources as described in the CSS Privacy Policy. We use and share personal information as described in the CSS Privacy Policy. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.
YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
The CCPA provides California residents (consumers) with specific rights regarding their personal information. If you are a resident of California and are not a job applicant, employee, or employee of another company interacting with us in your job role, you have the right to request what information we collect, use, and disclose. This includes the categories of personal information and the specific pieces of personal information. You may also request the sources of personal information collected about you, the purpose for collecting the personal information. You also have the right to request that we delete your information. To submit other individual right’s requests that apply in your region, please click here.
The CCPA also gives California residents the right to stop the “sale” of their personal information. Based on the current draft CCPA regulations, amendments, and modifications CSS does not "sell" your Personal Information. CSS utilizes Tracking Technologies including for example, cookies and tracking pixels, that help us, and others better understand you and serve you more relevant content and ads. To opt out of certain Tracking Technologies, please see Section 11 of this Privacy Policy.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. CSS does not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe we have collected information about your child, you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

Information CPLLC, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party
                  Services may collect: (1) personally identifiable
                  information, which is information that identifies you personally,
                  such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, and address, ("Personal
                  Information"); and
                  (2) non-Personal information, such as (to
                  the extent permitted by applicable law) your gender, age,
                  interests, and recent and upcoming purchases ("non-Personal
                  Information"). In addition, Personal Information, including,
                  without limitation, CPLLC-Collected PI (defined below), once
                  "de-identified" (i.e., the removal of personal
                  identifiers from data to make it no longer personally
                  identifiable) is also non-Personal Information and may be used and
                  shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by
                  applicable law. To the extent any non-Personal Information is
                  combined by or on behalf of CPLLC with Personal Information CPLLC
                  itself collects directly from you on the Service
                  ("CPLLC-Collected PI"), CPLLC will treat the combined
                  data as CPLLC-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy
Information Collected Automatically.
CPLLC, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also
                automatically collect certain information about you when you access
                or use the Service ("Usage Information"). Usage
                Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type,
                operating system, information about your use of the Service, and
                data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile
                device). Except to the extent defined by applicable law, or to the
                extent Usage Information is combined by or on behalf of CPLLC with
                CPLLC-Collected PI, CPLLC does not consider Usage Information
                (including, without limitation, device identifiers) to be Personal
                Information or CPLLC-Collected PI. CPLLC does consider IP address to be PI. For more information on
                Third-Party Services' data collection and practices click

                  Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"),
                  embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies,
                  fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking
                  methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter
                  developed ("Tracking Technologies") may be used to
                  collect information about interactions with the Service or
                  e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing
                  behavior.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's device,
                        which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session
                        cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and
                        expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain
                        longer and help in understanding how you use the Service, and
                        enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your device
                        for an extended period of time. If you use your browser's method
                        of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of
                        cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result some
                        features and functionalities of the Service may not work. A
                        Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file which may
                        be placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be
                        built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. HTML5 cookies
                        can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies and
                        HTML 5 cookies are locally stored on your device other than in
                        the browser and browser settings won't control them. To identify
                        certain types of local shared objects on your device and adjust
                        your settings, please visit: 5
www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html
. The Service may associate some or all of these types of
                        cookies with your devices.
Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as
                    "internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in
                    web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without
                    limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Service, to
                    monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content
                    views.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect
                    information about your interactions with the Service. It is
                    temporarily downloaded onto your computer from CPLLC's web
                    server, or from a third party with which CPLLC works, and is
                    active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted
                    or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and
                    other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely)
                    you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering
                    or restricting content based on your location.
Fingerprinting
Collection and analysis of information from your device, such
                    as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system
                    fonts, and other data, for purposes of identification and/or
                    tracking.
Device Recognition Technologies
Technologies, including application of statistical probability
                    to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to
                    different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to
                    recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g.,
                    that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be
                    included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based
                    like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some
                    use device identifier, or other identifiers such as "Ad
                    IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and
                    to track user activity across apps and/or devices.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain
                    Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking
                    Technologies across time and services, and used by CPLLC and
                    third parties for purposes such as to associate different
                    devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content
                    to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. See
Section 11
regarding certain choices regarding these activities.
CPLLC is giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your
                    choices regarding them explained in
Section 11
so that your
                    consent to encountering them is meaningfully informed.

Crackle may also obtain information about you from other sources,
                including Crackle's and Crackle's parent and related companies'
                affiliates ("Crackle Plus Companies"), Service Providers
                and Third-Party Services solely as allowed by law, and combine that
                with CPLLC-Collected PI. Such third-party-sourced, or
                non-Service-sourced, information (including Personal Information)
                will only be treated as CPLLC-Collected PI to the extent it is
                combined with CPLLC-Collected PI. CPLLC is not responsible or liable
                for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or for

            profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including
            Personal Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Service, your UGC will be

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and
            plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ("Third-Party
            Service(s)". These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking
            Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and
            certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social
            Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a
            Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" CPLLC's content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party
            Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the
            Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use
            Social Features, and potentially other Third Party Services, information you post or provide access to may
            be publicly displayed on the Service
(see Section 5)
or by the Third-Party Service
            that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (e.g.,
            by using a hashtag associated with Crackle Plus Companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be
            used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by Crackle Plus Companies. Also, both CPLLC and the
            third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party
            Service.
CPLLC may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the
            Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your
            browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising"
            and "online behavioral advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a
            Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting").
CPLLC may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without limitation, Google Analytics. These
            analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help CPLLC analyze Service users and
            how they use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage
            Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or
            elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of
            the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service's activity, and providing other services relating to
            Service activity and other internet usage.
Except to the extent CPLLC combines information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other
            third parties with CPLLC-Collected PI, in which case CPLLC will treat the combined information as
            CPLLC-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy
(see Section 1(c))
, data obtained by
            CPLLC from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to CPLLC's limitations
            regarding CPLLC-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however such data remains subject to any
            restrictions imposed on CPLLC by the third party, if any . Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and
            shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they
            continue to share information with CPLLC, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is
            visible to others on Third-Party Services.
CPLLC is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of
            any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services
            associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy
            policies and terms of use. See
Section 11
for more on certain choices offered by
            some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising
            and analytics.

DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING
CPLLC takes reasonable measures to protect CPLLC-Collected PI (excluding UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and
            unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet
            and online digital storage are not completely secure and CPLLC cannot guarantee the security of your
            information collected through the Service.
To help protect you and others, CPLLC and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use
            of the Service, and may collect and use related information including CPLLC-Collected PI and other Personal
            Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy,
            including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and
            investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance
            with the
Terms of Use
and this Privacy Policy; investigate
            violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of CPCLLC, their
            partners, and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity
            or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your
            use of the Service.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
CPLLC is based in the U.S. and the information CPLLC and its Service Providers collect is governed by U.S.
            law. CPLLC does not offer service outside of the U.S. not intend to collect information outside of the U.S.
            If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected
            through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S. Data protection laws in
            the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or provision of
            any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing,
            and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy
            Policy.

MINORS & CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children.
CPLLC does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children's Privacy
            Protection Act ("COPPA") ("Children's Personal Information") from children under the age of 13.
            If you are a parent or guardian and believe CPLLC has collected Children's Personal Information in a manner
            not permitted by COPPA, please contact CPLLC
in section 14
and CPLLC will remove such data
            to the extent required by COPPA.
Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who
            have posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting CPLLC
in section 14
, detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you
            posted it. CPLLC will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public
            view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable
            law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may
            have republished or archived content by search engines and others that CPLLC does not control.

Section
              9
) and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to

CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS
Tracking Technologies Generally.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial
                browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer
                different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from
                commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared
                objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go
                to Adobe's website
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html
.
                Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work
                and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is
                subject to your browser settings and limitations.
App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a
                mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions
                from your operating system or device manufacturer.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online
                services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not
                Track" means in this context. Like many online services, CPLLC currently does not alter CPLLC's
                practices when CPLLC receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about
                "Do Not Track," you can visit
https://www.allaboutdnt.com
, but CPLLC is not responsible for the completeness or
                accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding
                their Tracking Technologies. CPLLC is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third party
                choice notices or choice mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by
                third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
or downloading the Google Analytics
                Opt-out Browser Add-on.
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the
                advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may
                participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral
                Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based
                Advertising, visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for
                information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of
                the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for
                their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are
                able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types
                of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain
                Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content
                and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
                you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or
                web browsers or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA
                browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. CPLLC supports the ad industry's 2009
                Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (
https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf
). CPLLC is not
                responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or
                the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

                device. For example:

YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
CPLLC only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California's "Shine the Light" law), with

            direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in, or are offered the opportunity to opt-out and elect
            not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide personal information or choose to participate in a

            the personal information that was collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated
            third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes, but may continue to seek your consent to
            sharing with the same or other non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from

CPLLC Supplemental Privacy Policy For California Consumers under CCPA
INTRODUCTION.
This Supplemental Privacy Policy for California Consumers under CCPA ("California Statement") explains
              rights that California consumers may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA").
When we use the term "personal information" in this supplemental California Statement, we are using that
              term as CCPA defines it, which CCPA generally defines "personal information" to mean information that
              identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked,
              directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. However, personal information does not
              include publicly available, deidentified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in
              CCPA). Notably, the definition of "personal information" also does not apply to the collection of personal
              information from job applicants, employees - whether you are our employee or any employee of the entity
              arranging access to our Services for you, business owners, directors, officers, staff, or contractors.
Where we act as a "business" under CCPA (meaning we determine the manner and reasons for why we process
              your personal information), we may be required to disclose the categories of personal information we
              collect, the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we collect that information,
              and who we share that information - all of which depends on the specific Service.

            use and share personal information as described in the CPLLC Privacy Policy. When we disclose personal
            information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the
            recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except
            performing the contract.
YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS.
The CCPA provides California residents (consumers) with specific rights regarding their personal
              information. If you are a resident of California and are not a job applicant, employee, or employee of
              another company interacting with us in your job role, you have the right to request what information we
              collect, use, and disclose. This includes the categories of personal information and the specific pieces
              of personal information. You may also request the sources of personal information collected about you, the
              purpose for collecting the personal information. You also have the right to request that we delete your
              information.
The CCPA also gives California residents the right to stop the "sale" of their personal information.
              Based on the current draft CCPA regulations, amendments, and modifications CPLLC does not "sell" your
              Personal Information. CPLLC utilizes Tracking Technologies including for example, cookies and tracking
              pixels, that help us and others better understand you and serve you more relevant content and ads. To opt
              out of certain Tracking Technologies, please see
Section 11
of this Privacy
              Policy.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your
              behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. CPLLC does not
              knowingly collect information from children. If you believe we have collected information about your
              child, you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your child. You may only make a
              verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
              collected personal information or an authorized representative. Describe your request with sufficient
              detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your
              request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
              the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does
              not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a
              verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more
              time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an
              account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures we provide will
              only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we

CPLLC, and/or its Service Providers (defined below), may collect
                  information you provide directly to CPLLC and/or its Service
                  Providers via the Service. For example, CPLLC collects information

                  activities, or communicate or transact with CPLLC through the
                  Service. In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services
                  (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those
                  third parties. For more information on Third-Party Services' data

Information CPLLC, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party
                  Services may collect may include: (1) personally identifiable
                  information, which is information that identifies you personally,
                  such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number,
                  address, and full payment account number ("Personal
                  Information"); and (2) non-Personal information, such as (to
                  the extent permitted by applicable law) your gender, age,
                  interests, and recent and upcoming purchases ("non-Personal
                  Information"). In addition, Personal Information, including,
                  without limitation, CPLLC-Collected PI (defined below), once
                  "de-identified" (i.e., the removal of personal
                  identifiers from data to make it no longer personally
                  identifiable) is also non-Personal Information and may be used and
                  shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by
                  applicable law. To the extent any non-Personal Information is
                  combined by or on behalf of CPLLC with Personal Information CPLLC
                  itself collects directly from you on the Service
                  ("CPLLC-Collected PI"), CPLLC will treat the combined
                  data as CPLLC-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy
Information Collected Automatically.

                automatically collect certain information about you when you access
                or use the Service ("Usage Information"). Usage
                Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type,
                operating system, information about your use of the Service, and
                data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile
                device). Except to the extent required by applicable law, or to the
                extent Usage Information is combined by or on behalf of CPLLC with
                CPLLC-Collected PI, CPLLC does not consider Usage Information
                (including, without limitation, device identifiers) to be Personal
                Information or CPLLC-Collected PI. For more information on
                Third-Party Services' data collection and practices click

                  provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
                  stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:
                  Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"),
                  embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies,
                  fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking
                  methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter
                  developed ("Tracking Technologies") may be used to
                  collect information about interactions with the Service or
                  e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing
                  behavior.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's device,
                        which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session
                        cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and
                        expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain
                        longer and help in understanding how you use the Service, and
                        enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your device
                        for an extended period of time. If you use your browser's method
                        of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of
                        cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result some
                        features and functionalities of the Service may not work. A
                        Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file which may
                        be placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be
                        built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. HTML5 cookies
                        can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies and
                        HTML 5 cookies are locally stored on your device other than in
                        the browser and browser settings won't control them. To identify
                        certain types of local shared objects on your device and adjust
                        your settings, please visit: 5
www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html
. The Service may associate some or all of these types of
                        cookies with your devices.
Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as
                    "internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in
                    web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without
                    limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Service, to
                    monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content
                    views.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect
                    information about your interactions with the Service. It is
                    temporarily downloaded onto your computer from CPLLC's web
                    server, or from a third party with which CPLLC works, and is
                    active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted
                    or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and
                    other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely)
                    you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering
                    or restricting content based on your location.
Fingerprinting
Collection and analysis of information from your device, such
                    as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system
                    fonts, and other data, for purposes of identification and/or
                    tracking.
Device Recognition Technologies
Technologies, including application of statistical probability
                    to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to
                    different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to
                    recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g.,
                    that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be
                    included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based
                    like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some
                    use device identifier, or other identifiers such as "Ad
                    IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and
                    to track user activity across apps and/or devices.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain
                    Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking
                    Technologies across time and services, and used by CPLLC and
                    third parties for purposes such as to associate different
                    devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content
                    to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. See
Section 11
regarding certain choices regarding these activities.
CPLLC is giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your
                    choices regarding them explained in
Section 11
so that your
                    consent to encountering them is meaningfully informed.

Crackle may also obtain information about you from other sources,
                including Crackle's and Crackle's parent and related companies'
                affiliates ("Crackle Plus Companies"), Service Providers
                and Third-Party Services solely as allowed by law, and combine that
                with CPLLC-Collected PI. Such third-party-sourced, or
                non-Service-sourced, information (including Personal Information)
                will only be treated as CPLLC-Collected PI to the extent it is
                combined with CPLLC-Collected PI. CPLLC is not responsible or liable
                for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or for
                third party policies or practices.

              limitation, Personal Information, non-Personal Information, and Usage
              Information, in connection with their work on CPLLC's behalf, provided

              you direct marketing messages other than related to the Crackle Plus

            profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including
            Personal Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Service, your UGC will be

            contrary, Personal Information included in UGC is not subject to CPLLC's usage or sharing limitations, or
            other obligations, regarding CPLLC-Collected PI or other Personal Information under this Privacy Policy or
            otherwise, and may be used and shared by CPLLC and third parties to the fullest extent not prohibited by

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and
            plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ("Third-Party
            Service(s)". These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking
            Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and
            certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social
            Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a
            Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" CPLLC's content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party
            Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the
            Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use
            Social Features, and potentially other Third Party Services, information you post or provide access to may
            be publicly displayed on the Service
(see Section 5)
or by the Third-Party Service
            that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (e.g.,
            by using a hashtag associated with Crackle Plus Companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be
            used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by Crackle Plus Companies. Also, both CPLLC and the
            third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party
            Service.
CPLLC may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the
            Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your
            browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising"
            and "online behavioral advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a
            Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting").
CPLLC may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without limitation, Google Analytics. These
            analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help CPLLC analyze Service users and
            how they use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage
            Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or
            elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of
            the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service's activity, and providing other services relating to
            Service activity and other internet usage.
Except to the extent CPLLC combines information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other
            third parties with CPLLC-Collected PI, in which case CPLLC will treat the combined information as
            CPLLC-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy
(see Section 1(c))
, data obtained by
            CPLLC from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to CPLLC's limitations
            regarding CPLLC-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however such data remains subject to any
            restrictions imposed on CPLLC by the third party, if any . Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and
            shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they
            continue to share information with CPLLC, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is
            visible to others on Third-Party Services.
CPLLC is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of
            any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services
            associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy
            policies and terms of use. See
Section 11
for more on certain choices offered by
            some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising
            and analytics.

DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING
CPLLC takes reasonable measures to protect CPLLC-Collected PI (excluding UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and
            unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet
            and online digital storage are not completely secure and CPLLC cannot guarantee the security of your
            information collected through the Service.
To help protect you and others, CPLLC and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use
            of the Service, and may collect and use related information including CPLLC-Collected PI and other Personal
            Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy,
            including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and
            investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance
            with the
Terms of Use
and this Privacy Policy; investigate
            violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of CPCLLC, their
            partners, and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity
            or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your
            use of the Service.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
CPLLC is based in the U.S. and the information CPLLC and its Service Providers collect is governed by U.S.
            law. If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected
            through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S. Data protection laws in
            the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or provision of
            any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing,
            and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy
            Policy.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children less than 13 years of age. Some
            portions of the Service, however, may be intended as appropriate for a mixed audience of users under and
            over 13 years of age, or for users under 13 years of age (e.g., a separate "Kids" section). For further
            information on how CPLLC treats Children's Personal Information (defined below) in connection with any
            children's or mixed-use portions of the Service (if any), please see the Children's Privacy Policy posted
            thereon, which will be deemed incorporated herein for purposes of that part of the Service.
CPLLC does not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children's Privacy Protection
            Act ("COPPA") ("Children's Personal Information") in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA, and for any
            children's or mixed-use portions of the Service (if any) CPLLC will comply with COPPA. If you are a parent
            or guardian and believe CPLLC has collected Children's Personal Information in a manner not permitted by
            COPPA, please contact CPLLC
in section 14
and CPLLC will remove such data to the extent
            required by COPPA.
Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who
            have posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting CPLLC
in section 14
, detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you
            posted it. CPLLC will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public
            view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable
            law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may
            have republished or archived content by search engines and others that CPLLC does not control.

ACCESSING AND CHANGING INFORMATION
CPLLC may provide web pages or other mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the
            CPLLC-Collected PI, and potentially certain other information about you (e.g., profile and account
            information). CPLLC will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in CPLLC's then-active databases
            as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your
            information or public postings from CPLLC's databases (California minors
see Section
              9
) and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to
            retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the
            purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS
Tracking Technologies Generally.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial
                browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer
                different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from
                commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared
                objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go
                to Adobe's website
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html
.
                Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work
                and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is
                subject to your browser settings and limitations.
App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a
                mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions
                from your operating system or device manufacturer.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online
                services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not
                Track" means in this context. Like many online services, CPLLC currently does not alter CPLLC's
                practices when CPLLC receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about
                "Do Not Track," you can visit
https://www.allaboutdnt.com
, but CPLLC is not responsible for the completeness or
                accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding
                their Tracking Technologies. CPLLC is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third party
                choice notices or choice mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by
                third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
or downloading the Google Analytics
                Opt-out Browser Add-on.
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the
                advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may
                participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral
                Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based
                Advertising, visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for
                information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of
                the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for
                their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are
                able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types
                of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain
                Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content
                and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
                you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or
                web browsers or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA
                browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. CPLLC supports the ad industry's 2009
                Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (
https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf
). CPLLC is not
                responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or
                the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
Mobile Apps.
With respect to CPLLC's mobile apps ("apps"), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of
                the app by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as
                enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile
                device. See also the prior section regarding the DAA's mobile Interest-based Advertising choices.
Communications.
You can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications (emails or text messaging) from CPLLC
                at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, following the instructions provided in emails to click on
                the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your
                account; and (ii) for text messages, following the instructions provided in text messages from CPLLC to
                text the word, affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other
                subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications,
                CPLLC may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those
                about your account, transactions, servicing, or CPLLC's ongoing business relations.
Audience Measurement.
The Service may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will enable you to contribute
                to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. To learn more about the information that Nielsen
                software may collect, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy at

YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
CPLLC only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California's "Shine the Light" law), with
            non-affiliated third parties (i.e., parties other than our affiliated Crackle Plus Companies) for their own
            direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in, or are offered the opportunity to opt-out and elect
            not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide personal information or choose to participate in a
            feature on the Service. If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at that time, CPLLC will not knowingly share
            the personal information that was collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated
            third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes, but may continue to seek your consent to
            sharing with the same or other non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from
            time-to-time. Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated separately so it is possible that you may
            consent to some sharing but not to others.
In addition, California residents may request information about CPLLC's compliance with the Shine the Light
            law and the Crackle Plus Companies with which CPLLC may have shared personal information for their direct
            marketing purposes by contacting CPLLC here or by sending a letter to Crackle Plus, LLC at PO Box 700, Cos
            Cob, CT 06807 (Attention: Privacy Program, Information Security). Requests must include "California Privacy
            Rights Request" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and
            ZIP code. Please note that CPLLC is only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and
            CPLLC is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or
            mail address

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
CPLLC reserves the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be
            effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Service
            indicates your consent to the Privacy Policy then posted. If you do not agree, discontinue use of the
            Service and uninstall Service downloads and applications. If you have a subscription to a Service offering,
            material changes to this Privacy Policy will only become effective with respect to the aspect of that
            subscription at the end of the then current term unless you otherwise consent.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,

,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see

Digital measurement
privacy
notice - US
Effective Date: December 2024
Nielsen ("
Nielsen
", "
we
", or "
us
") is committed to protecting consumer privacy and processing personal data in an open and transparent manner. This Digital Measurement Privacy Notice ("
Notice
") covers the collection, use, and disclosure of data collected via our proprietary software and digital technologies in order to provide digital measurement services to our clients. These services measure and analyze how consumers engage with media online, across websites, mobile apps and devices, and enable Nielsen to offer research insights into consumer online behavior. The practices described in this Privacy Notice are undertaken by Nielsen companies providing digital measurement services around the world. Learn more about Nielsen's group of companies
here
.
This Privacy Notice reflects our general digital measurement practices. However, our contracts with clients may place limits on what we can or cannot do with data collected when we provide such digital measurement services to them. In some cases, we may not be permitted to use and share data in all of the ways described in this Privacy Notice. When our contract with a client only permits us to process data to provide the client with services, we typically do so as a "service provider" or “data processor”. When our contract with a client permits us to process data for purposes other than providing services to the client, we may do so as a "business" or "data controller".
Please review the privacy notices of website publishers and other parties whose websites and applications you use for specific information about their use of data collected on those websites and applications, including through their use of our digital measurement services. We require our clients to let their users know about the use of measurement products and software (although they may not always identify Nielsen by name), ensure they have obtained appropriate permissions to collect, use, and disclose to us data collected as a result of their use of the our digital measurement services; and ensure users are given appropriate choices with respect to the collection and use of their data.
A. Data collection
Nielsen works with various companies, including , advertisers, agencies and publishers, to measure the effectiveness and reach of online content viewed or listened to, regardless of the device used to consume it. For example, we help advertisers better understand campaign performances across television, computer and mobile device audiences.
How Data is Collected:
Our clients include Nielsen's proprietary measurement software in their content on their chosen sites, advertisements, mobile apps, video players, and other internet-connected devices (such as smart TVs). Alternatively, they may provide us data directly through connections to their servers or other secure data transfer methods. In this Privacy Notice the word "content" refers to audio, video, advertisements and any other media users might encounter or engage with online. Nielsen's measurement software is embedded in the content or via the devices that you use in order to gather information that helps us understand what content users are exposed to and interact with, and which advertising campaigns are effective.
The specific data collected depends on how our clients use our measurement software but a description of the data we can collect is provided below. We do not identify, or attempt to identify individuals from the data collected:
Desktop:
IP address, cookie ID, hashed email address, browser type, language, and referring website addresses.
Mobile Device:
IP address, Cookie ID, hashed email address, device type and model, mobile Advertising identifiers, operating system
Connected TV:
IP address, cookie ID, hashed email address, browser type, language, and referring website addresses.
We also collect information about the content that was viewed – such as the ad campaign, program or episode as well as information about where the content was viewed – such as the website or the app.
We do not track or collect information about users' activities across sites or applications. Data we collect may be matched with data from Nielsen panelists or other companies that recognize their own users or that collect data about consumers generally, such as social media companies or ecommerce companies. Data from these other sources is used to enhance or calibrate the data collected from our measurement software, and to enable more robust research and analyses. These companies provide Nielsen with aggregated audience statistics (such as age and gender make-up of an audience) which does not include data that could directly identify an individual.
In some cases, we collect information directly from individuals. Occasionally, Nielsen presents short surveys to users who may or may not have been exposed to our clients' content. Responses are voluntary, and the surveys do not ask for or collect any directly identifiable data.
B. Data use
We process personal data to provide our digital measurement services to clients. This enables the creation of research insights, reports, and analyses of consumer online behavior including the composition of the audience that viewed certain content or about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign, such as an audience measurement report finding that an ad campaign was viewed by "70,000 females between the ages 24-30 in the U.S., Pacific Northwest region."
We use tools and methods to make sure that there is no reasonable possibility of identifying users from the reports and insights we create and provide to our clients. The data we collect from users is combined with the data collected from other sources to produce aggregated reports from which users cannot be uniquely identified; if it is not aggregated, we take steps to make sure there is no reasonable possibility of re-identification.

Operate and manage our IT and security systems, including to monitor such systems and identify and respond to security events;
