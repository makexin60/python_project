Pixodust Games Privacy Policy
Last Updated:
March 14, 2025.
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how
Pixodust Aplicativos LTDA
(doing business as
Pixodust Games
) and
Pixo Games LDA
(together referred to as “
Pixodust Games
,” “
we
,” or “
us
”) collect, use, and protect your personal data when you play any of our mobile games. We are committed to complying with all applicable data protection laws, including the EU
GDPR
, Brazil’s
LGPD
, and California’s
CCPA
, while keeping the language clear and user-friendly.
Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile games developed and published by
Pixodust Games
and
Pixo Games
. By downloading or playing our games, you agree to the collection and use of your information as described in this policy. If you
do not agree
, please do not play our games or uninstall them.
Data We Collect
When you use our games, we collect certain information to operate and improve the game experience. This includes:
Device Information:
We automatically collect data about the device you use to play, such as your device model, operating system, browser type, language, and general device identifiers (e.g. IP address,
Advertising ID
like Google AdID or Apple IDFA). This helps us ensure the game works correctly on your device and optimize performance.
In-Game Usage Data:
We track your in-game actions and progress (for example, levels completed, scores, game modes used, and other gameplay events). This information is
non-identifying
and is used to balance the game, fix bugs, and provide a better experience for everyone. We may also collect crash reports or error logs when the game crashes or malfunctions to help us diagnose and fix issues (
crash analytics
).
User Communications:
If you contact us for support or feedback (e.g. via email to our support team), we will collect your name, email address, and the content of your message. We use this only to assist you and resolve your issue.
We
do not
directly collect sensitive personal details like your real name, address, phone number, or financial information through the game, unless you voluntarily provide them (for instance, in a support email). Our games typically do not require account registration, so we generally identify you through device information or a game-specific
player ID
.
Third-Party Services (Ads and Analytics)
Our games integrate
third-party SDKs
(Software Development Kits) provided by advertising networks and analytics services. These help us serve ads (so we can offer the game for free) and understand how players use our games. Please note that these third parties may collect additional data under their own privacy policies, which is beyond Pixodust’s direct control. We select partners whose privacy practices align with ours, but we
cannot control their independent data collection
​.
Advertising Partners:
We work with reputable ad networks to show ads in our games. The ad SDKs we use include:
AppLovin
,
DT Exchange (Digital Turbine)
,
Vungle
(
Liftoff
)
,
Google AdMob
,
InMobi
,
IronSource
,
Meta Audience Network
(Facebook)
,
Mintegral
,
Pangle
(TikTok)
,
Chartboost
, and
Unity Ads
. These partners may collect data such as your device identifiers (Advertising ID), IP address, location (general region), and in-app purchase or engagement information to
personalize ads
and prevent fraud. Each of these companies has its own privacy policy detailing their data practices.
For example, see AppLovin’s policy on their site.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these ad partners for more information on their practices.
Analytics Providers:
We use analytics SDKs to understand game performance and player behavior. The services we use include:
Singular
,
GameAnalytics
,
Google Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics
, and the
Facebook SDK
(for Facebook login or analytics). These tools help us collect
aggregated statistics
— for instance, how often levels are completed or which features are most used. This data guides us in improving game features and fixing problems. Analytics providers may also record device information or usage data as described in their privacy policies.
Important:
These third-party SDKs may automatically collect data
independent of us
, and their use of your data is governed by their own privacy policies. Pixodust Games
does not receive personal data like your name or email from these ad/analytics companies
– we mostly see aggregated reports. We do
not share any more data with them than is necessary
for their function (for example, we provide the game ID to analytics to link events). If you want to know more or opt-out of any specific third-party data collection, please refer to the privacy settings provided in-game (if available) or the privacy policies of the respective third-party services.
How We Use Your Data
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
To Run and Improve the Game:
Data like device type and gameplay events are used to ensure the game functions properly on your device, to save your progress, and to diagnose crashes or bugs so we can fix them. This is essential for providing you with a smooth gaming experience.
Analytics:
We analyze usage data (e.g., which levels are most played, where players spend the most time) to make informed decisions on game design and updates. This helps us understand what players enjoy and what might need improvement.
Advertising:
Showing ads allows us to keep our games free. We use the data collected by ad partners to display
relevant ads
(including personalized ads if you have consented to them). For example, ad networks may use your device’s Advertising ID to avoid showing you the same ad repeatedly or to serve ads that are more likely to interest you.
Customer Support:
If you reach out to us with a question or problem, we will use the information you provided (like your email and description of the issue) to help resolve your request and communicate with you.
Safety and Cheating Prevention:
We may monitor certain in-game actions or device signals to detect fraud, hacking, or cheating behaviors and to keep the gaming environment fair and secure for all players. This is done under our legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of our games.
We
do not
use your data for any purposes other than those described above. In particular,
we never use your data to make automated decisions that could significantly affect you
(for example, there is no algorithmic decision to deny you access to features – any data-driven in-game adjustments affect all players generically, like matchmaking or difficulty tuning, not individually targeted decisions).
Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR/LGPD) & Consent
We process personal data
only when we have a valid legal reason
to do so, in accordance with GDPR and LGPD principles. The legal bases we rely on include:
Consent:
In regions that require it (such as the European Economic Area under GDPR, or Brazil under LGPD), we will ask for your consent before collecting or using certain data, especially for personalized advertising and advanced analytics.
When you first launch our game, we detect your country/region and display the appropriate privacy consent notice.
For example, EU and Brazilian players will see a pop-up requesting consent for us and our partners to collect and use data (like device IDs for ads). By accepting, you agree that we can process your data as explained in this policy.
You can withdraw your consent at any time
by using the privacy settings in our games (if available) or by contacting us. Withdrawing consent will stop the further processing of your data for the purposes you had initially agreed to (for instance, if you withdraw consent for personalized ads, we will show you only non-targeted ads thereafter).
Legitimate Interests:
We may process some data without your explicit consent if we have a legitimate interest to do so –
provided this is not overridden by your personal rights and freedoms
. For example, it’s in our legitimate interest to collect basic device info and crash logs to maintain the security and functionality of the game, or to run
non-personalized (contextual) ads
​. We believe these uses benefit both us and players (by improving the product) and have minimal impact on your privacy. You have the right to object to any processing we do on this basis (see
Your Rights
below).
Performance of a Contract:
In many cases, our data processing is necessary to provide the service you are requesting – i.e., the game itself. When you play our game, you are effectively in a user agreement with us: we process data like your game progress and preferences to deliver the features you expect. This is another lawful basis recognized under GDPR/LGPD. In simpler terms,
we use your data to deliver the game you came to play
.
Legal Obligation:
If we are required by law to collect or share certain data (for example, to comply with a court order or tax regulations for in-app purchases), we will do so. We will only disclose the minimum necessary information in such cases.
For users in
California (CCPA)
: The CCPA generally allows data collection and sharing for business purposes as long as we inform you in this policy and give you the opportunity to opt out of any “sale” of personal information. We treat the act of installing/using the game as an acknowledgment that we collect and use your data as described. We do
not
collect sensitive personal information or use your data for any purposes beyond what is stated here without consent. If you do not wish for us to collect or use data as described, you have the right to opt-out or request deletion (see
Your Rights
). We do not collect data from you for any purposes that would be considered outside of what an average player would expect from a mobile game (running the game, showing ads, etc.).
Note on Consent for Ads:
If you decline consent for personalized ads (or opt-out via device settings), we will still serve you ads, but they will be
non-personalized
. Non-personalized ads do not use personal data for targeting – they may still use contextual information (like the content of the game or general region) but not your unique profiles or behavior. This ensures we can keep the game free while respecting your choice. Likewise, if you opt out of analytics, we will limit data collection to only what is essential for the game’s operation.
Data Sharing and Disclosure
We take your privacy seriously.
We do not sell your personal information to third parties
. This means we never share your data with external parties in exchange for money. In fact, under the CCPA’s definitions, we
do not “sell” personal data at all
, and you will not see ads from unrelated third parties using your data outside of our game’s context.
However, we do share certain data with third parties in the following situations, strictly to serve you and operate our business:
With Service Providers:
We share necessary data with our third-party partners listed above (advertising networks and analytics providers) so they can perform services on our behalf – for example, showing an ad to you, or analyzing crash reports. We only share what is needed (such as your Advertising ID for ad frequency capping, or a crash log for debugging). These partners are bound by contracts to
use your data only for our specified purposes
and to protect it. They are not allowed to use your info for their own unrelated purposes. For instance, an ad partner cannot take your device ID from our game and use it to market other products to you outside our app – it’s only used to decide which ad to show in our game.
Within Pixodust/Pixo Games:
The two entities (Pixodust in Brazil and Pixo Games LDA) may share data with each other as essentially they operate together to develop and publish the games. This is an internal sharing just to manage the games and is fully covered by this policy. We treat all data with the same level of protection regardless of which entity processes it.
For Legal Reasons:
If we are
legally required
to disclose data, or if a governmental authority (with the proper jurisdiction) requests information, we might need to comply. For example, responding to a lawful subpoena or court order might require us to provide data we have. In such cases, we will only share the information that we are compelled to and will inform you if legally permitted.
To Protect Rights and Safety:
We may share data when we believe it’s necessary to enforce our
Terms of Service
, to investigate or stop fraud or security issues, or to protect our players, our rights, and the public. For example, if someone is attempting to hack the game or engage in fraudulent purchases, we might share data with platform providers or law enforcement to address it.
Business Transfers:
In the unlikely event that Pixodust Games (or a portion of our business) is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, user data could be transferred to the successor or new owner as part of that transaction. If that happens, we will ensure the new owner honors the commitments we’ve made in this policy regarding your personal data. You would be notified (for example via an in-app notice or on our website) of any such change in data ownership.
Aside from the above,
we do not share your personal data with any other third parties
. We do not disclose or sell your names, emails, or any contact information to marketers. Any sharing is either with your consent or as necessary to provide and maintain the game services. We also may share
aggregated or de-identified information
(which can no longer identify you) publicly or with partners – for example, we might tell a business partner that “1 million players played our game this month” or share general gameplay statistics. This information has
no personal data
and is only used for industry analysis, marketing, or research.
Data Retention
We retain personal data
only for as long as necessary
to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy​. In practice, this means:
As long as you actively play our games, we will keep the data we collect (since it’s needed to run your game and track progress, etc.).
If you stop playing, we may continue to store your data for a period of time in case you return, and for our internal analysis or record-keeping. This period is not fixed, but we aim to not keep data longer than we truly need it.
If you request
deletion
of your data (see
Your Rights
below), we will promptly delete or anonymize your personal data from our active systems, except for information we are required to keep by law or for legitimate business obligations (for example, records of purchases for financial auditing).
Crash logs and analytics data are usually retained only for short periods or in aggregate form. For instance, crash reports might be kept for a few months to ensure the issue is resolved in updates.
When we no longer have a lawful reason or business need to keep your personal data, we will securely erase it or de-identify it.
Please note that due to the nature of mobile platforms, some data (like high scores or achievements saved to your device or cloud services like Apple Game Center/Google Play Games) may remain on your own device or in platform-specific cloud storage even after we delete our copies. You should also delete the game app if you want to remove all local data it may have stored on your device.
Since we do not require account sign-ups, many data points (like Advertising IDs) can be reset by you.
Tip:
You can reset your device’s Advertising ID in your phone settings, which will disassociate your past data from a new identifier.
Your Rights and Choices
We believe you should have control over your personal data. Depending on where you live, you may have some or all of the following rights regarding your data:
Access and Portability:
You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you​. We will provide this in a readily usable format (generally electronic). For example, you can ask us to confirm if we’re processing your data and to give you a summary of what data that is.
Correction (Rectification):
If any personal data we have is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or update it. For instance, if you believe we have an incorrect record of your device or game progress linked to you, let us know and we will fix it (though typically our data is tied to device IDs, not real names).
Deletion (Right to be Forgotten):
You can ask us to delete the personal data we have about you​. This is sometimes called the “right to be forgotten.” For example, if you no longer want us to have your data, you can request deletion and we will remove your information from our records (except data we are required to keep by law).
Important:
If you want us to delete data associated with your game account, please include your
Game ID
in the request so we can identify your records. You can find your unique Game ID in the game’s settings menu (or you can send us an email through the in-game support option, which automatically includes your Game ID). Once deleted, your game progress or any in-app purchase history tied to that data may be lost, so consider this when making a deletion request.
Withdraw Consent:
If we are processing your data based on your consent (for example, you allowed personalized ads), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. You can usually do this in the game settings (look for a privacy or ads settings option) or by contacting us. Once you withdraw consent, we will stop the processing that you previously agreed to. There is
no penalty
for withdrawing consent – the game will remain available to you, just with reduced or adjusted features as necessary (like only generic ads).
Object to Processing:
You have the right to object to certain types of processing. For example, you can object to the use of your data for direct marketing or profiling. In our case, if you prefer that we
do not use any analytics or advertising data
from your gameplay beyond what’s needed to run the game, you can object. We will evaluate requests to object and comply unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue (in which case we will inform you). If you object to personalized ads, we will treat it similar to withdrawing consent and switch you to non-personalized ads. If you object to analytics, we will stop collecting analytics from your play going forward.
Note:
Our processing is fairly limited, but this right exists to give you control.
Restrict Processing:
In certain circumstances, you can ask us to
limit
how we use your data (for instance, if you contest the accuracy of your data, you can request we don’t use it until it’s verified). We don’t typically have scenarios of heavy processing, but if needed, we will mark your data to be excluded from certain processes until resolved.
Non-Discrimination:
We will
never deny you our services or give you lower quality service for exercising your privacy rights
. If you choose to opt-out of certain data uses or ask for deletion, we will respect that and not treat you differently​. The only difference might be that some features relying on your data may become unavailable (for example, if you ask us to delete all your data, your cloud save might not work, since it’s considered personal data; or if you refuse tracking, you might see more repetitive ads since we can’t cap frequency as effectively). But we will not punish or mistreat you for any privacy choice.
California Residents (CCPA-Specific Rights):
If you are a resident of California, in addition to the above rights, you have the right to: (a)
Know
the categories of personal information we have collected about you in the past 12 months, the sources of that information, the business purpose for collecting it, and whether we disclosed it to third parties (which we detail in this policy); (b)
Access
the specific pieces of personal information we have about you (you can request a data export); (c)
Delete
your personal information (same as above); and (d)
Opt-Out of Sale
of personal information. As noted, we do
not sell your data
​, so unless our practices change, you will not need to submit a “Do Not Sell” request because we don’t share your data in that manner. If that ever changes, we will update this policy and provide a clear way to opt out. California law also gives you the right to appoint an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf, and the right to receive equal service and pricing from us even if you exercise your privacy rights (no discrimination, which we already commit to).
Brazilian Residents (LGPD-Specific Rights):
If you are a resident of Brazil, you have rights under the LGPD very similar to GDPR. These include confirmation of the existence of processing, access to your data, correction of incomplete or out-of-date data, anonymization or blocking of unnecessary data, portability (when applicable), deletion of data processed with consent, information about public and private entities with whom we shared your data, and the right to withdraw consent. We intend for our responses to cover these rights as well. For example, a request for deletion under GDPR covers the LGPD deletion right; a request for information covers the confirmation and access rights, etc. You also have the right to petition the Brazilian data protection authority (ANPD) if you have concerns. We include Brazil in all our compliance efforts.
To
exercise any of your rights
, or if you have questions about your privacy, you can contact us at
privacy@pixodust.com
. Please clearly state your request and
identify the game
you play (including your Player/Game ID from that game’s settings). We may need to verify your identity to protect your privacy – for example, we might reply asking you to perform a simple verification action through the game or to confirm details about your account, to ensure we’re dealing with the correct person. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with the applicable law (for example, GDPR requires within 30 days in most cases).
Deletion Requests:
If you email us to delete your data, please note that deletion is irreversible. Once completed, you may lose any in-game progress or purchases tied to your data. We will guide you through what that means before completing your request. Also, after deletion, if you happen to play the game again, we might start collecting fresh data under a new identifier (as if you were a new user).
Access Requests:
If you request to know what data we have, we will compile and send you the information. It will likely be technical (because we mostly have device IDs, event logs, etc.), but we’ll help interpret it if needed.
We aim to make it easy for you to exercise your rights and will never charge you for these requests (they are free).
Children’s Privacy
We care about the privacy of young players, and we do
not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13
​. Our games are
intended for ages 13 and up
. We design our content and ads with a general audience in mind and do not target children specifically. However, we do not put up strict age gates in our games, so it is possible that children under 13 might download and play them.
If you are under 13
, please only play our games with permission and supervision from a parent or guardian. Do not send us any personal information (such as your name, email, or phone number). We strongly encourage parents to be aware of and guide their children’s online and gaming activities.
If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will
take steps to delete that information promptly
. For example, if a child under 13 contacts us and provides their name or email, we will delete that contact info once the support issue is resolved. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child under 13 has provided personal information to us or is being tracked by our services inappropriately, please contact us at privacy@pixodust.com. We will investigate and remove the information as necessary.
For residents in California under age 13, we also do not sell their info (and in general we do not sell data, as stated). For residents in the EU under age 16 (the age of consent may be 16 in some EU countries), we treat the game as not collecting personal data for personalized ads unless consent is obtained from a parent/guardian. Typically, if we detect a user is under the required age for consent, we will default to non-personalized ads and limited data collection mode.
Our games might contain links or ads that could potentially lead to content not suitable for children (for example, an ad might lead to another game or a web page). We advise parents to supervise if a younger child is playing and take advantage of parental controls on app stores or devices (such as setting age ratings, using child profiles, or disabling ad tracking) to ensure an appropriate experience.
International Data Transfers
Pixodust Games operates globally. The data we collect from you
may be transferred to and processed on servers located in countries outside of your own
. For example, if you are in the EU or Brazil, your data might be processed on servers in the United States or other regions where some of our third-party partners are located (like our ad and analytics providers). We will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data during these transfers, as required by GDPR/LGPD. This typically means we rely on standard contractual clauses or other approved transfer mechanisms when moving data from the EU/Brazil to other countries.
By using our games, you understand that your data may be transferred to other jurisdictions. Rest assured, no matter where your data is processed, we protect it under the standards of this Privacy Policy. Our third-party partners are also obligated to handle your data securely and lawfully. If any partner cannot guarantee adequate protection in line with GDPR/LGPD, we will not use that partner for your data.
Security Measures
We employ
reasonable security measures
to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This includes using encryption where appropriate, keeping our software up to date, and limiting access to personal data to only those employees and contractors who need it to perform their duties. We also require our third-party providers to implement security safeguards.
However, please understand that no method of transmitting or storing data is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. It’s important that you also play your part: keep your device secure, and avoid sharing any personal login information (if the game has any) with others. If you suspect any security issue or vulnerability in our game, let us know and we will address it promptly.
Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. If we make material changes, we will
notify you by means appropriate
– for example, by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy and possibly showing you an in-app notice or pop-up about the changes. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically for any updates.
If the changes affect how we process data that we collected based on your consent, we will seek your consent again where required (for instance, if we start using a new type of personal data or introduce a new third-party service, we might trigger a new consent screen so you can agree or disagree)​. Minor updates (like clarifications or grammatical fixes) will be effective once posted. Major changes will be communicated clearly.
Your continued use of our games after an update signifies your acceptance of the revised policy. If you do not agree to the changes, you should stop using the games and you may request that we delete your data.
Contact Us
If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please contact us:

)
We will be happy to assist you and will respond as soon as possible, typically within 30 days. If you contact us by mail, please include an email or other contact method so we can reply more quickly.
If you feel we have not addressed your concerns satisfactorily, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (for EU, your supervisory authority; for Brazil, the ANPD; for California, the California Attorney General’s office or the CPPA). We would appreciate the chance to help you first, though, so please reach out and we’ll do our best to resolve any issue.
Thank you for playing our games and trusting us with your data.
We are committed to providing fun experiences while respecting your privacy.
