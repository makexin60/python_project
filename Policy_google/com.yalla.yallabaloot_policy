Virtual Items and subscription services require users to purchase from officially approved channels such as App

Handing over your account to others for operation, conducting private transactions with others, prohibited
        proxy recharge ( any purchase of Virtual Currencies through unofficial channels, or entrusting accounts to
        others to recharge on their behalf are strictly forbidden. The common types of prohibited proxy recharges
        (including but not limited to, purchase and recharge from nonofficial third-party recharge platforms, private
        transactions with third parties, and provision of user accounts to log in and recharge from third-party devices)
        or malicious refunds after recharging are all violations of the platform rules. These actions will disrupt the
        normal management of the platform, and will also put users’ accounts and personal information at risk including
        but not limited to the leakage of users’ information, fraudulent use of credit cards, failure of recharge, and
        the malicious theft of accounts. Moreover, these types of recharge and/or refunds are mostly scams, which can
        easily cause property damage. We will always crack down on the aforementioned behaviors and maintain the right
        to pursue legal liabilities according to applicable law.
In response to the aforesaid violations, the platform has rights to take measures including but not limited to

          canceled or the amount of refund is reimbursed in full.
Time-limited or permanent ban on the account.

          refunds, or account transactions.
