The Full Detailed Privacy Policy
What Information Do the Services Collect?
Information You Provide to Us
On the Services, we may ask you to provide us, or our service providers, with certain categories of information, such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, title, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone numbers, social security number, birth date, debit card or bank account information (“
Personal Information
”); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender (“
Demographic Information
”). To comply with legal, contractual, and other obligations, you may be required to provide certain information to us in order to utilize the Services, such as first name, last name, title, email address, birth date, telephone number, permanent address, social security number, passport information, driving license information, other identification documents, source of funds, tax-related information, and location-based information (described below). For compliance reasons and identity verification obligations, provision of this information, when requested, may be a mandatory condition of using some or all of the Services. We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Services, including if you register for an account, through “contact us” forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Services. If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Services, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
Information Collected and Stored As You Access and Use the Services
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Services, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services (“
Usage Information
”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “
Device
”) whenever you visit or interact with our Services. When your Device contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit this Services or view an HTML e-mail), our web servers automatically collect Usage Information. We also may determine the applicable technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail, advertising or promotional announcement or similar service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Services, we will treat it as Personal Information.
This Usage Information may include:
your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
your Device functionality (including browser type, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
the areas within our Services that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;
your Device location;
your Device characteristics; and
certain other Device data, including the time of day, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Services among other information.
We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“Tracking Technologies”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies used on the Services, include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
Browser Cookies.
Like many websites, we use browser “cookies”. Cookies are a website’s way of remembering who you are. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer’s hard drive or stored temporarily in your computer’s memory. There are two kinds of cookies: those that are “session” oriented and those that are “persistent”. Session cookies delete from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies retain information for later use tomorrow, next week, next month, or whenever they are set to expire. We use cookies to help us to identify account holders and to optimize their experience on our Services. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of the Services. Most web browsers accept cookies automatically. You can delete cookies manually or set your browser to automatically delete cookies on a pre-determined schedule. If you decline to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of the Services and when you revisit our Services your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.
Flash Cookies.
Our Services enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe’s Flash Player is a commonly used software use by websites that offer video and other interactive content. By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects”). Adobe provides a short disclosure about Flash Cookies in its End User License Agreement, stating: “Use of the web players, specifically the Flash Player, will enable the software to store certain user settings as a local shared object on our computer. These settings are not associated with you, but allow you to configure certain settings within the Flash Player.” The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced above, but flash cookies can store more information than browser cookies and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. You can control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. If you do not allow flash cookies to take any disc space on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features on the Services. Users with a computer running the Windows operating system can view flash cookie files in this folder: \Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player. Users with a computer running the Apple operating system can view flash cookie files in this folder: /users/[username]/Library/Preferences/macromedia/Flash Player. Flash cookies, or LSO files are stored typically with an “.SOL” extension. Although the Adobe Flash Player is a commonly used software used by websites that offer video content and/or games, it is not the only technology being used in the ever-shifting online and mobile content environment. HTML5 is an increasingly popular web standard used for presenting content, especially content delivered to mobile devices. HTML is the mark-up language used for the World Wide Web. Almost all web pages you visit on the internet are based around HTML code. HTML5 is simply the fifth and latest iteration of this mark-up language that allows for more interactive web pages. One of the real benefits of HTML5 is its potential to standardize the highly fragmented rich-media universe. Some HTML5 code may allow your response to advertising and other activities to be monitored across websites and such information to be stored on your computer or mobile device.
Web Beacons.
Our web pages, online services and e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a “clear gif”, that allows us to monitor and collect certain limited information about our users, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our Services, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many of the messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon. We use web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about our Services and our marketing campaigns.
Embedded Scripts.
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Browser Fingerprinting.
Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.
ETag, or entity tag.
A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
Recognition Technologies.
Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user).
We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:
Strictly Necessary.
We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Services, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of Services’ functionality.
Performance Related.
We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Services, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, ads, products or services offered through the Services.
Functionality Related.
We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Services, including identifying you when you use our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences.
Targeting Related.
We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests on our Services and thirdparty services based on how you interact with our advertisements and/or content. This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content and ads that have been delivered to you.
There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Services. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Services, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services as well as across your Devices. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third-party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Services and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.
Location-Based Information
You will not be able to use wagering services or place bets with us without location data being turned on. Our Services use precise location-based services in order to locate you so we may verify your location, process payments, perform analytics, deliver you relevant content and ads based on your location, share your location with our vendors as part of the location-based services we offer, and for purposes of legal and regulatory compliance. We may use non-precise geolocation data for all purposes set forth in this privacy policy. Both precise and non-precise geolocation may be disclosed to third party entities pursuant to Section 3(c) below.
Information Third Parties Provide About You
We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Services. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Services with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. You authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to us or our service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help us identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. To the extent we combine information we receive from third-party sources with Personal Information we collect on the Services, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties, even if they have used our technology to collect it and share it with us.
Interactions with Third-Party Services
The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Services and a third-party website or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Services to facilitate your sending a communication from the Services such as facilitating emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may share information with us and they may also retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Services.
Information You Provide About a Third Party
You may send someone else a communication from the Services, such as sending an invitation to a friend. If so, the information you provide (names, email addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Services, your contact information, name or username and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s). Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies.
Do Not Track Disclosures
Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.
How Do We Use the Information Collected?
We may use your Personal Information, Demographic Information or Usage Information that is subject to this Privacy Policy:
to provide you with information such as to send you electronic newsletters or to provide you with special offers or promotional and marketing materials on behalf of us or third parties, including to let you know about new products, services or upcoming contests, promotions or events;
to protect and administer your Services account;

to improve the overall experience at the Services;

How and When Do We Share Information With Third Parties?
We may share non-Personal Information, including Usage Information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties. Further, we may share your Device Identifiers with third parties along with data related to you and your activities. Also, we may share your Personal Information with third parties with whom we have marketing or other relationships for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Additionally, in our continuous effort to provide services that we believe you may find useful or of value, we may make your Personal Information available to third parties better facilitate your requests, provide more personalized services and communicate separately with you. We may also share the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. BIU may additionally disclose your information under the following circumstances and conditions:
When You Request Information From or Provide Information to Third Parties
You may be presented with an option on our Services to receive certain information and/or marketing offers directly from third parties or to have us send certain information to third parties or give them access to it. If you choose to do so, your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed to such third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to the third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties. In addition, third parties may store, collect or otherwise have access to your information when you interact with their Tracking Technologies, content, tools, apps or ads on our Service or link to them from our Service. This may include using third-party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or other third-party posting or content sharing tools and by so interacting you consent to such third party practices. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review such third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them.
Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf
We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Services, such as: (i) to assist us in Services operations; (ii) to manage a database of customer information; (iii) hosting the Services; (iv) designing and/or operating the Services’ features; (v) tracking the Services’ activities and analytics; (vi) enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services; (vii) to process payments and deliver prizes; and (viii) other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. For example, from time to time, we will use the information we collect to coordinate data entry and payments with the company that provides you with handicapping information, to coordinate marketing/rewards programs with partner racetracks, and to offer other enhancements to the Services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them. However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available
here
. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options.
To Protect the Rights of BIU and Others
We may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose any of your information (including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, including precise geolocation data and other potentially sensitive Personal Information) to third parties: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal process if in our good faith opinion such is required or permitted by law; (ii) to protect and/or defend the Services’, its integrity, and our
Terms and Conditions
or other policies applicable to the Services, including investigation, determination, or validation of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect the safety, rights, property, integrity, or security of the Services or any third party; and/or (iv) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. Such potential disclosures include disclosing Personal Information and Device Identifiers to gaming regulators, leagues, associations, governing bodies, sports teams, colleges or oversight agencies or boards (or their designated vendors) in relation to the enforcement of our
Terms and Conditions
and their rules governing authorized betting, including in connection with identifying or overseeing their athletes, employees, personnel, or members. We may also use IP address or other Device Identifiers to identify individuals, either acting alone or in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies. Such identifying information may be disclosed pursuant to this Section.
Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you. In circumstances where we inadvertently obtain information that appears to pertain to the commission of a crime or where we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person exists, BIU may voluntarily disclose the record or the contents of your communications or other information about you to law enforcement agencies and governmental entities without providing you advance notice. Upon receipt of an applicable search warrant or administrative, grand jury or trial subpoena, BIU may be required to disclose to the government or law enforcement agencies, without advance notice to you, the content of your communications and other records relating to your electronic communications, as well as the following records: your name and address; records of your online communication (including session times and duration); how long you have subscribed to our service(s) (including start date) and the type(s) of service(s) utilized; your telephone number or other subscriber account identifying number(s), including any Internet or network address(es) assigned to you by our network; and the means and source of your payment(s) (including any debit card or bank account number).
Affiliates and Business Transfer
We may share your information, including your Device Identifiers and Personal Information, Demographic Information and Usage Information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, including for their marketing or other purposes. We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Services or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process.
What About Information I Disclose Publicly or to Others?
User Content and Public Information
The Services may permit you to submit ideas, photographs, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, information about your location, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “
User Content
”). We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content. Please note that BIU does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Services or what others do with information you share with them on the Services. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Services.

For full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit to the Services, please review our Services’
Terms and Conditions
.
Ads and Information About You
We and third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges may serve advertisements on the Services or across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities across the Internet and mobile media (“
Behavioral Ads
”). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.
Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information via a Device Identifier. These third party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
We may use third-party advertising companies to target advertisements to you on our Services, across the web, on your mobile Device and on any of your other Devices, based on the information we have collected from and about you, as well as information relating to your and other users’ visits to this and other websites and online services. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags) or recognize an identifier associated with your mobile device. These companies may also use these Tracking Technologies, along with personal information they or we collect on the different devices you use, to recognize you across the Devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. Some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available
here
.
Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit https://thenai.org/opt-out/, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“
NAI
”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members, including through the
Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out link
. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“
DAA
”) website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices. To opt out of Google Analytics display advertising or customize Google display networking ads, visit the
Google Ads Setting page
. For Mobile applications, you can use the "
DAA App Opt-Out Tool
" and the
NAI App Opt-Out Tool
". Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options or programs.
Please note that these opt-outs apply per browser and per device, so you will have to opt out for each device — and each browser on each device — through which you access our Services.
Does Third-Party Content, Links to Third-Party Sites and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Services?
When you are on the Services you may be directed to other sites and apps that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control such as merchants who directly sell products and services to you. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their sites or apps and they may be tracking you across multiple online services and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These third parties may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. For example, if you “click” on a link, the “click” may take you off the Services onto a different location. These other online services may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect information about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of third-party owners. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party online service or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these services. We also encourage you to note when you leave our Services and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.
How Do I Change My Information and Communications Preferences?
You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. The Services may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information you have provided through the Services’ registration forms or otherwise by updating your account, and you may provide registration updates and changes by contacting us by email at:
support@fanduel.com
. If so, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable (but we may retain prior information as business records). Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Services, information that you remove may persist internally for BIU’s administrative purposes. You may cancel or modify our email marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of emails the opt-out will be so limited. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our Services, such as administrative and Service announcements and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.
If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy or practices described in it, you should contact us in the following ways: Postal Mail: Betfair Interactive US LLC, 123 Town Square Place, PMB #607, Jersey City, NJ 07310 (Attn: Privacy Officer); Email:

Privacy Shield
Connexity participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Connexity is committed to subjecting all personal data received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, to the principles underlying the Privacy Shield (the “Principles”). To learn more about the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program, and to view Connexity’s certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce site at https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Accountability for Onward Transfer
If we transfer personal data received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, to a third party acting as a controller, we will do so consistent with any notice provided to data subjects and any consent they have given, and only if the third party has given us contractual assurances that it will (i) process the personal data for limited and specific purposes consistent with any consent provided by the data subjects; (ii) provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and notify us if it makes a determination it cannot do so; and (iii) cease processing of the personal data or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate if it makes such a determination. If Connexity has knowledge that a third party acting as a controller is processing such personal data in a way that is contrary to the Principles, Connexity will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing.
With respect to our third-party agents, we will transfer only the personal data needed for an agent to deliver to Connexity the requested product or service. Furthermore, we will (i) permit the agent to process such personal data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) require the agent to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal data transferred in a manner consistent with Connexity’s obligations under the Principles; and (iv) require the agent to notify Connexity if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles. Upon receiving notice from an agent that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.
Connexity remains liable under the Principles if an agent processes personal data received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, except where Connexity is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Complaints
If you are located in the European Union, in the event that you wish to make a complaint about how your personal data is being processed by us or that we have not taken any action requested by you in relation to your rights set out above, you have the right to lodge a complaint directly with our EU supervisory authority and our data protection representative. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority so please contact us in the first instance.

Privacy Policy
WE TAKE PRIVACY VERY SERIOUSLY
At Dstillery we take consumer privacy very seriously.  As a data science company, we are interested in patterns of web browser IDs and mobile application IDs in order to understand consumer behaviors.  The data we collect via our technology is generally considered pseudonymous in most places we operate.
HOW ADVERTISING KEEPS WHAT’S ON THE INTERNET FREE
Think about TV. These days, if you want to see the really great television series and movies uninterrupted, you have to pay for them. What if you had to pay for all the great websites and apps?
Dstillery is helping keep the Internet free by enabling marketers to target their ads to the right audience in a way that protects the privacy of users. We’ve created technology that drives the performance of online ads while knowing as little about the user as possible. It’s privacy by design. Our technology does not capture personally identifiable information like name, postal address or email address, nor build profiles that enable us to ascertain who you are.
The result for any given user is more relevant advertising. And for all users a robust, free Internet!
GLOBAL OPT-OUT
If you would like to remove and/or opt out of Dstillery’s cookies, you can do so by clicking on the opt-out button below.
By clicking opt-out you will no longer receive targeted advertisements from Dstillery on this browser.
Global Opt-Out
CONSUMER ASSISTANCE
Dstillery uses proprietary social targeting technology to deliver relevant ads to consumers. To accomplish this, Dstillery, like many other Internet advertising technologies, uses “cookies” and similar tracking technologies, including those offered by most mobile operating systems. Mobile operating systems (e.g., iOS and Android) offer opt-out choice mechanisms applicable to mobile applications and these choice mechanisms may be found via your mobile device settings. More information about the choice mechanisms available on mobile devices may be found
here
.
Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. Dstillery’s cookies are generated and stored on a user’s computer when an Internet browser (e.g., Internet Explorer or Firefox) views one of Dstillery’s online ads. The tracking technologies used by Dstillery do not collect or otherwise process your name, address, phone number, email address, or any other personally identifiable information which directly identifies you. The company uses cookies to help track the effectiveness of online ads and to serve the more relevant ads to consumers. If you would like to remove and/or opt out of Dstillery’s cookies, you can do so in one of three ways:
Clear them manually from your browser using the method specified by that browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.)
Use the automated Dstillery process listed on this site as
Opt-out of Dstillery ad targeting on websites.
Visit Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) website and use the opt-out procedure, which can be used to opt-out from the use of data for interest-based advertising purposes from digital advertising companies, including Dstillery. To access this service, please visit the DAA at:

COMPLETE PRIVACY POLICY
LAST UPDATED February 20, 2025
Dstillery, Inc. (“Dstillery”) is an online advertising technology company. Dstillery provides this privacy policy to inform you how its proprietary technology processes information on behalf of the digital advertisers, website owners, and other businesses that use its services. This policy also outlines Dstillery’s privacy practices on its corporate website, www.Dstillery.com as well as the types of information we collect from our clients.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to email the company at
privacy@Dstillery.com
.
THE TYPES OF DATA PROCESSED BY DSTILLERY
Dstillery thinks about the data we process in terms of whether or not the data may be used by Dstillery to identify a data subject. Accordingly, we place the data we process into two categories:
identifiable
personal data and
pseudonymous
personal data. We recognize that identifiable personal data and pseudonymous personal data are considered personal data under the applicable privacy or data protection laws in many places. However, we believe that data that may not be used to identify an individual is inherently less risky. Accordingly, Dstillery endeavors to use pseudonymous personal data via our advertising technology platform in most places and we use data minimization and de-identification techniques where it is feasible for us to do so.
Identifiable personal data such as a name, a postal address, a telephone number or an email address is personally identifiable information (“
PII
”) in that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity.
Pseudonymous personal data such as a mobile ad ID, a cookie ID or an IP address is not personally identifiable (“
Non-PII
”) in that it cannot be used by Dstillery to identify or locate a particular person or entity.
We believe that distinguishing the data processed on the basis of whether it is identifiable is an important privacy distinction.
WEBSITE PRIVACY PRACTICES
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Dstillery collects Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) from its website, www.Dstillery.com, when you choose to provide it to us. For example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, or by completing a form on this website. Dstillery uses this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry. Once collected, Dstillery will store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Dstillery also collects Non-PII from visitors to this Website, including your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system. Non-PII also includes PII that has been hashed so that it may not be used to identify someone. As noted above, in some places, such as the State of California and the EU, certain Non-PII such as cookie IDs and IP addresses are considered personal information.

Dstillery and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, and track users’ movements around the website. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. For more information about cookies, please visit:

Third Party Websites
The Dstillery website may contain links to and advertisements for websites operated by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from Dstillery’s policies.

DSTILLERY’S TECHNOLOGY PRIVACY PRACTICES
Dstillery is in compliance with the
Digital Advertising Alliance Self-regulatory Code in the United States
. Our technology collects non-PII (defined above) from mobile apps and websites, including this website and utilizes that information to deliver interest-based advertising. We also may allow other third-party advertisers to collect Non-PII from this website and utilize it to deliver relevant ads and for other purposes in accordance with industry standards. You may opt-out from interest-based advertising by clicking onto the
DAA
opt-out mechanisms.
TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW
Dstillery’s technology Platform uses “network neighbor” data to help our clients deliver relevant digital advertisements on websites and mobile apps. “Network neighbors” are generally two or more people that visit the same website pages, utilize the same wifi network or use the same mobile apps. For example, a network neighbor might be someone whose social networking profile page you’ve visited, used the same mobile application you’ve used or someone that visits the same website that you visit. Network neighbors are likely to share many similar interests, hobbies, and other key demographic characteristics with you, although we don’t typically know what (if any) interests or hobbies are shared by any group of network neighbors. Rather, Dstillery believes that if you’re interested in a particular product or service, your network neighbors are likely to also be interested in that product or service. Therefore, by understanding whom your network neighbors are and what they like, the company’s proprietary technology Platform will do a better job determining the digital ads that are likely to be of interest to you.
Dstillery’s technology Platform collects information about the website(s) that you visit (including this Website), the mobile apps that you use and the ads that you see. We also obtain data from third-party partners. When we receive de-identified data, we won’t attempt to identify any of the data subjects in the de-identified data set. And where we can reasonably infer that a particular computer or device belong to the same household (e.g., where multiple computers or devices use the same IP address), we may extend our advertising and targeting capabilities across multiple devices. You may encounter our technology Platform when: Dstillery or one of our clients purchases digital ads on a website that you visit or a mobile app that you use or when one of our clients places a web beacon on a website that you visit. Dstillery’s Platform doesn’t operate our pixel technology in the European Union or UK and we take steps to block any personal data from EEA, Swiss and UK data subjects prior to ingestion into our systems. Rather, we focus on our ID-Free Customer AI service in the EEA, Switzerland and UK.
The company uses the information collected in order to help make the digital ads and marketing messages you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by
clicking here
. Please note our opt-out only applies to the browser or device that has opted out and does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive ads, but those ads will not be targeted via our technology Platform. For more information about our opt-out mechanisms, including our mobile application choice mechanisms, please scroll down to the section of this Privacy Policy entitled: “Controlling The Use of Your Information”.
ID-Free Custom AI
Dstillery offers an additional technology platform which collects a limited data set called ID-free Custom AI (“ID-Free”) which does not process personal data and does not involve the use of cookies or mobile advertising IDs by Dstillery. For more information, please scroll down to the section on the EEA and UK or contact
privacy@dstillery.com
.
TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT VIA OUR TECHNOLOGY
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
With the exception of ID-Free Customer AI, we collect pseudonymous personal information (“Non-PII”) via our technology Platform, including but not limited to browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider, IP address, and basic ad serving information such as the time and date an ad is served, the name of the mobile app or URLs from the web page visited. This type of Non-PII is also considered personal information when collected from California consumers. We collect IP addresses and pseudonymous mobile advertising identifiers created by the mobile O/S manufacturers to help our systems recognize a computer or device over time and to help us synch data with our customers and partners. The tracking technologies we use to collect this data include cookies and pixel tags.
We also work with device identity platform partners to enable our clients to bring their online and offline data into our systems for use by our technology Platform. The data collected by our technology Platform is pseudonymized prior to being used for ad targeting.
Retention of Data Collected
For information gathered via our technology Platform, Dstillery retains some data collected via its technology Platform in its original form for up to 30 days in order to ensure that our technology is functioning properly. After 30 days, the original raw data set is deleted and a de-identified data set is stored for up to two years; pseudonymous data may be stored for up to one year for research purposes. We also store Non-PII in cookies, which expire no later than 60 days from the last time our systems have encountered a particular computer or device. For the ID-Free product, the raw data set is stored for up to two years.
CONTROLLING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
Opting Out from Interest Based Advertising (our “Choice Mechanism”)
Computers and Web Browsers
If you’d like to opt out from having Dstillery use your information to target advertising, please
click here
. When you opt out, Dstillery will attempt to place an opt-out cookie on your computer or device. The opt-out cookie tells our technology Platform not to use your data to target ads on websites from that computer or device. The opt-out cookie also tells our technology that California data subjects have opted out from Dstillery’s sale of their personal information. Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Also, when our systems are able to detect that do not track or similar universal opt-out mechanism has been set on a browser, we treat that user as having opted out from Dstillery as well.
Mobile Apps
Mobile operating systems (e.g., iOS and Android) offer opt-out choice mechanisms applicable to mobile applications and these choice mechanisms may be found via your mobile device settings. More information about the choice mechanisms available on mobile devices may be found
here
. And Dstillery participates in the
DAA AppChoices mobile opt-out application
as part of honoring the
DAA Code for the Mobile Environment.
Where our systems detect that a user of a device has opted out via their mobile operating system, our technology Platform won’t use your data to target ads on mobile applications for that device. Similarly, when our systems indicate that a user of a device has opted-out from Dstillery via AppChoices, our technology Platform won’t use your data to target ads on mobile applications for that device. We also use mobile operating system opt-outs and AppChoices opt-outs as a way for data subjects to opt-out from our sale of their personal information as required under applicable law. Also, when we can see that a website or mobile app publisher or an internet browser has sent us a signal indicating that a particular User has proactively asked to opt-out from sales, profiling and/or targeting advertising, we will honor those signals in accordance with applicable law.
Please note that these opt-out choice mechanisms only apply to the particular device that has opted out and does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive ads, but those ads will not be targeted via our technology Platform.
Precise Location
Dstillery does not receive precise location data such as lat/long in connection with our technology Platform. If you’d like to adjust your choices regarding the use of precise location data by other third parties, you may do so via your device settings. Also, most mobile applications that collect precise location information offer choice mechanisms. A helpful description of many leading mobile platform choice mechanisms may be found
here
.
Data Integrity, Purpose Limitation
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.

The United Kingdom (UK) and European Economic Area (EEA)
The General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”) affords additional rights to EEA data subjects and the UK and Switzerland have each enacted equivalent data protection laws to the GDPR. For the purposes of this privacy policy, we’ll refer to the GDPR to indicate the respective data protection laws in each of those places.
The Dstillery technology platform collects a limited data set on data subjects located in the UK, EEA and Switzerland. This technology platform, called ID-free Custom AI (“ID-Free”) does not process personal data such as email or phone number or IP addresses and does not involve the use of cookies or mobile advertising IDs by Dstillery. ID-Free uses the following data points to help advertisers make ad targeting decisions: non-precise GEO, URL visited and time/date stamp. None of this data is considered personal data under EU data protection law. When our systems ingest data from partners, that data set generally includes a pseudonymous UID that is not directly identifiable by Dstillery or the partner.
As an EEA, UK or Swiss data subject, you have the right – partly under certain conditions:
to request information about the processing of your data free of charge, as well as the receipt of a copy of your personal data;
to request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data being processed, the recipients of the data (if they are passed on), the duration of the storage or the criteria for determining the duration;
to correct your data. Should your personal data be incomplete, you have the right to complete the data, taking into account the processing purposes;
to delete or block your personal data. Reasons for the existence of a cancellation/blocking right can be, among others, the revocation of the consent on which the processing is based, the data subject objects to the processing, the personal data were processed unlawfully;
to restrict the processing of your personal data;
to object the processing of your personal data;
to revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data in the future, and;
to complain to the competent supervisory authority about inadmissible data processing.
As an EEA, UK or Swiss data subject, you may access those rights with respect to Dstillery by
clicking here
, clicking the link entitled “data subject access request” in the footer at the bottom of this page.
Although we don’t process personal data via ID-Free, we nonetheless take the position that our legal basis for processing data on the ID-Free platform is our legitimate interest. Where we rely upon legitimate interest, we have assessed the processing is not high risk, does not involve the processing of sensitive data or the creation of intrusive profiles. In almost all instances, our processing will not involve personal data at all.
We may receive certain personal data from the personnel of our clients and partners where such personnel are located in the EEA or other places outside of the United States. For example, some clients and partners may provide email and login credentials to login to our systems. We encourage the personnel of such partners to first reach out to the person that manages the business relationship between Dstillery and your organization. You may also make a request by clicking the link entitled “data subject access request” in the footer at the bottom of this page.
Information Relating to Children, Sensitive and Special Category Data
Dstillery’s Platform, Website and our products and services are designed for those 18 years of age and older. Dstillery does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 18. If the company is made aware that it has received PII from someone under 18, it will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from its records.
We don’t generally collect sensitive or special category data such as ethnicity, religion, sexual interest, sensitive health data including protected health information or data from minors as defined under applicable law. We may obtain certain sensitive data in an employment context which is covered under a different policy. We ask our customers and partners not to send this type of information to us. And where we see the Dstillery pixel firing from websites which we believe might be sending us sensitive or special category data, or are otherwise sent such data, we take steps to prevent that data from being ingested into our systems.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties, Onward Transfer
Dstillery processes data in the United States. To the extent that our processing requires the transfer of personal data out of the UK, EEA or Switzerland, we typically use transfer mechanisms such as the Standard Contractual Clauses to effectuate such transfers safely.
Dstillery does not rent, sell or share your PII with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. The company may, however, share data with trusted third-party service providers and contractors who provide certain services for us,  The services provided by these third-party service providers and contractors include: a) cloud computer, data storage and file storage providers, b) email marketing providers, c) website and b2b sales analytics providers, d) customer relationship management, contact database vendors, data hygiene vendors, survey vendors and project management software providers, e) customer billing systems vendors, f) login authentication providers to ensure that the logins to our systems are working efficiently, g) outsourced computer programmers helping ensure our systems are operating properly, h) auditing, debugging and security vendors. These agents work on our behalf and use data only as directed by us under written agreements which outline how they may use such data and require that such third-party agents provide at least the same level of privacy protection as we do.
Dstillery also transfers Non-PII to our advertising clients and their agents, which includes ad networks, advertising technology platforms, ad agencies, website and mobile app publishers and other companies that facilitate the delivery of advertising via digital media. These transfers may be considered a sale under California law.
The company may also share aggregate data collected on the website or via its technology Platform with unaffiliated third parties. For example, Dstillery may disclose that digital ads offering ‘country music’ ring tones receive more clicks than those offering ‘classic rock music’ ring tones. This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually.
Dstillery may be required to disclose your information to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including transfer reasonably intended to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
Finally, Dstillery may transfer information, including any PII or Non-PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If Dstillery is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This privacy policy is subject to change. If the company plans to make any material or substantive changes to its practices or this privacy policy, it will post a clear and conspicuous notice on the website and in this privacy policy prior to the changes being made.
