your device make and model;
game play attempts, progression and results;
session game time start, end and duration;
the country of your Device;
the time, date and install source of your first download; and
identification of crashes and defects.
We do not view or use this data. It is collected because it is not technically possible to remove the Flurry technology from the relevant Games. However, the data is not viewed or used by us and deleted as soon as possible. Please reach out to Flurry Inc directly, if you have any questions.
Where you access the Game though a Store or third party distribution platform, these third parties may conduct their own analytics. This will be explained in their own respective privacy policies.
Information collected for the purposes of providing Website analytics
Website Analytics
When you visit our Website we collect technical information about your use of the Website through the use of Google Analytics Cookies (see more on cookies in section 6 below). Read Google’s overview of privacy and safeguarding data
here
.

Sales Performance Data
The Stores allow us to see data in regards to how our Games are selling in the relevant Store in different territories. This is made available to us in aggregated form and we are not able to single out any one individual from this data, except as set out for the Google Play Store below.

For purchases made from customers in the US, we are able to see their postcode, city and state (but no exact address or name). This order information in Google Play allows Fireproof to administer refunds, declined orders, monitor order statuses and it can help us spot fraudulent patterns.

This page tells you a lot of things about how we use information about you, when you play one of our games or spend time on our website. To help you understand all this, we have written down some key things here.
If you ask us a question or tell us about an issue by email, we collect your email address and anything you include in the email. We only use this to properly respond to your email.
The Room 2 and The Room 3 collect information about how you play them. For example, what device you are using to play the game and how much time you spent on different parts of the game. This is because of the technology in the game. We don’t use this information, it is automatically stored and then automatically deleted.
When you visit our website, we collect information about how you use our website but we only know that
a person
did certain things on our website, we don’t know your name and can’t connect this information to you. We just want to know how people use our website in general so we can make sure it’s great to use.
If you have bought our game through Google Play, Google lets us see the order and what other games have been bought by the same person. When seeing these orders, we don’t know your name and can’t connect this information to you.
The law gives you rights about your information. You have all the same rights as adults!  For example, you can ask us to delete all the data that we have about you or ask to see all the data we have about you. Make sure to ask a parent or guardian, if you want to use one of these rights or you’re not sure about what they are or mean.
We work with a handful of other companies to help us run the website and our games. To do this, we give them access to some of the information we hold. The information they get from us is not shared with anyone else and they are only allowed to use it to help us, and not for anything else.
If you have any questions about any of this, you should speak to your parent or guardian or ask us about it by sending us an email to
datacontroller@fireproofstudios.com
.
Please also remember that if you are under 18, you must get your parent’s or guardian’s permission to play our games.

datacontroller@fireproofstudios.com
.

Information about Security
