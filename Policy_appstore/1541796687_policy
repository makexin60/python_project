Privacy Policy
Last Updated March 2024
Galaxy Interactive Pty Ltd. and their subsidiaries and parent companies (collectively, “
Lumi Interactive
”, “
Lumi Studios
”, “
we
”, “
our
,” or “
us
”) are a gaming company that develops, produces, distributes and co-develops products and services for game developers and their players worldwide.
This is our privacy policy (the “
Privacy Policy
”), which explains how we collect, use and share data through our mobile games (the “
Games
”), our websites (the “
Websites
”), our pages or presence on third party websites (e.g., Facebook) (the “
Third Party Platforms
”) and other platforms, websites products, offers and services that we offer from time to time, all of which together we refer as “
Services
” or “
Service
”.
This Privacy Policy applies when you use our Services. Please read it before using our Services.
Galaxy Interactive Pty Ltd. in this Privacy Policy refers to Lumi Interactive, Lumi Studios and any other corporate entities within the same corporate group (including parent companies and subsidiaries) (“
Affiliated Entities
”).
If you do not want Lumi to collect, store, use, or share your personal information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you may not play our games or use our Services.
1. INTRODUCTION
Our Privacy Policy applies whenever you use our “Services” which, as we described above, means our games, products, services, content, our websites, and/or other domains or websites operated by Lumi. It describes the ways we use your (personal) data and your rights.
Regardless of whether you are located in or outside of the European Union or European Economic Area, Lumi are the “
joint data controllers
” of your personal data. We will refer to countries in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland collectively as the “
European Countries
” in our Privacy Policy.
2. DATA COLLECTION
We aim to minimize how much personal information we collect from users when they play the Games or use the Websites. The information we collect about you do not identify you personally but may uniquely identify the device you are using to play the Games or use the Websites ("Device").
2.1 Data about you that you give us directly
While you use our games, you may give us data directly (like when you are setting up your account), and we will store that data on our databases and use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
When you use our games you may give us the data such as:
Player name and gender
Profile information (such as profile photo)
Chat log when you contact us for support
Other information that helps us make sure it is you accessing your account or helps us providing support to you. Please see the “Support correspondence” section for more detail.
2.3 Data generated using our games
When you use our games, we collect data about the ways in which you use and interact with our games, such as when and for how long you play, game features and other players you interact with, purchases you make, progress or levels you achieve, and other gameplay activities. If you choose to use communication features in Services that allow you to communicate or share information with other players, then we would collect information on what is communicated or shared.
2.4 Payment data
We also collect data related to any purchases you make. If you purchase in-game virtual currency, our third-party payment partners will collect the billing and financial information it needs to process your charges. This may include your postal address, e-mail address, and financial data. Our payment partners do not share your financial information, like credit card numbers, with us.
When you play our games connected third-party applications or platforms (like Facebook, Apple or Google), any purchases you make will be processed by that third-party application and subject to that third-party application’s terms of service and privacy policy. For these purchases, Lumi does not receive your financial data, but may receive non-financial information related to your purchases, like the order number and the items purchased. The information Lumi receives depends on our game you are playing and the third-party application. Our Terms of Use explain our policies and terms related to charges, billing, third-party credits, and virtual currencies. Please note that purchases of third-party credits or currencies are also subject to those parties’ terms of service and privacy policies.
2.5 Other Data we automatically collect
Advertising ID which is a unique device identifier associated with your phone to tablet used by advertisers for ad tracking purpose
General location information (such as country and city of location when you play the game to be displayed in our multiplayer screen)
Device information (such as device name, operating system information, and language)
2.6 Support correspondence
When you ask for help from our support team, we may collect and store the contact information you give to us (generally, your name, e-mail address, player ID), data about your game play or your activity in a game. We will also store the communications you have with our support and any additional information in those communications in order to provide support and improve the Services. Please note that in many cases in order to identify you we will need a minimum amount of data (e.g., player ID). Without this information, we will not be able to provide support or answering your data rights’ requests (as mentioned in Section 5 below), so please be aware that we may contact you and request additional information in order to provide service.
When you contact us for support, the below information will be collected and handled by our support software Helpshift strictly in accordance with our instructions:
Player ID
Name or nickname
Problem description
Our processors also automatically collect additional types of data, such as your Google Play email address if you’ve signed into Google Play and your device information and language to provide and improve our support to you. The data is then transferred to a processors’ servers in the United States. As a safeguard to protect your privacy, we arranged a data processing agreement with our support partners or joint sharing personal data agreements (where our partner is also a data controller of the personal data), where we ensure that your personal information is only used in accordance with our instructions and not for their own purposes or are used in accordance with the applicable law requirements or our contractual arrangements with our partners. In addition, your request is submitted via an encrypted connection and we apply the principle of data minimization to collect only such data that is actually required to best answer your support request. The content of your request will be stored as long as you are an active player of our game, so you can get a faster response in case you have a similar problem in the future. The purpose of using the service support partners is to answer the extensive number of user requests we receive. Our support processors help us to improve our customer service so that you can get a faster and helpful response.
2.7 Data about you from third-party partners
We collect some information from other entities such as Facebook, Apple and Google, if you access our games through your accounts with those entities or you choose to connect your accounts with those companies to our games.
If you play our games through any third-party platforms, such as Google Play, Lumi may receive certain data about you from the provider of the third-party platforms. The information we receive depends on our game you are playing, the third-party application and your privacy settings.
For instance, we may collect and store some or all of the following information from the provider of the connected third-party application:
Profile picture
Your social network ID (e.g. Facebook ID), which is usually an ID that cannot be linked to your public profile.
Email address you provided to that third-party application
Demographic data in aggregate that cannot be personally identified to you (such as to determine a coarse location of your IP address)
Data for advertising and analytics purposes, so we can provide you with a better Service
If you access our Games from a third-party platform, you should also read that third-party application’s terms of use and their privacy policy.
2.8 Cookies
Like other online providers, we and our partners may use cookies or similar technologies for analytics purposes to provide and personalize our Service to you. You can disable cookies in your browser, however our Service may not function properly.
3. USE OF DATA AND LEGAL GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING
The use of data we collect and store is to provide you with the Services you request from us and to improve your in-game experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we collect and store your data include:
to improve and optimize our games and your experiences in our games
to create your player accounts and allow you to play our games
to identify and suggest connections with other players and personalize our Services to you
to communicate with you, including in-game updates and notifications, new Services, and promotional offers that we think might be of interest to you
to enable players to communicate with each other
to provide support and respond to player requests
to provide a safe and fair environment for our multiplayer features
to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our
Terms of Use
to manage and deliver personalized advertising
to administer promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our partners
to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties.
If you are located in European Countries, our legal basis for collecting and using the data described above depends on what data is and the context in which we collect it.
However, we normally collect data from you only where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e., our Terms of Use), where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these aren’t overridden by your interests or rights), or if you give us your consent.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation or need to collect data from you or may otherwise need the personal data to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, another player). If we ask you to provide data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we are asking you to provide your data (for example, when we ask you to provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in accordance with our Terms of Use), and, if not, we will provide an explanation to you at the relevant time. We will also make clear whether providing data is mandatory.
Similarly, if we collect and use your data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), it will be made clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are (such as personalizing our services and direct marketing, for example).
If you have questions or need further information about the legal bases on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at
privacy@lumiinteractive.com
at any time.
4. DATA SHARING
We share some of your data with your friends and other players that you are playing with to facilitate your in-game interactions. We may also share your data with third parties or allow third parties to collect this information from our games in the following manner:
4.1 Friends and other players
Our games support encourage you to interact with other players. In most games, your friends who also play our game will see your player name, photo and your level and rank, but not details of your player profile.
Further, in our games other players (not being your friends) will be able to see your player profile and your country when you battle with them, and send you friend requests through our games. You can turn off displaying of your country via Settings -> Show location option.
4.2 Third-party analytics and advertising
For a complete list of our third party providers and partners please see below.
As an online business, it is important to us to know how players interact with the Game and interact with each other. We use third party Analytics Partners to collect location information, device information and advertising ID so we can measure, analyze and improve our Games and Services. It is also important to us to keep the Game fair for multiplayer sessions and we cannot deliver this without analytics.
We also share some of your data with advertisers to tailor the advertisements you see when you use our Services to your interests. We use advertising to enable us to offer some of our games for free. These advertisements may include, without limitation, a full-screen ads in between some gameplay for a short period or in-game items offered to players in exchange for watching a video advertisement for a longer period.
We do not actively share personal data that directly identifies you with third-party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.
To enable advertisers and ad media partners to serve you with more relevant ads (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), they may collect, or we may collect and share with them, the following types of data when you use our games:
A unique device identifier called Advertising ID
Location information
Device information
You can review in more detail what our advertising service providers collect from our list of partners below.
If you do want to receive interest based in-application advertisements from third parties, your mobile device could offer your ability to opt-out for all apps on your device. On Android devices, you may opt-out by enabling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting. On iOS devices, you may opt-out by enabling the "Limit Ad Tracking" setting. If you want to opt-out from specific advertising partner please review our information in the full partner list. If you just want to opt-out interest based advertising within our Game, please contact us at
developer@lumiinteractive.com
. Please note that if you opt out interest based advertising, you will still receive contextual ads which are related to the Game you’re playing not based on your interests.
4.3 Security measures
We share your data if necessary for safety, security, or compliance with law. Your data and the contents of all of your online communications in our games and between you and Lumi may be accessed and monitored as needed to provide our games and may be disclosed:
to satisfy any laws or regulations that apply
when we have to disclose the information in response to lawful requests by public authorities
if our Games are being used in committing a crime or to share data with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and other security precautions
to protect the rights or property of Lumi or applicable third parties.
4.4 Other third parties
In addition to the sharing described above, we may share your data with other third parties or allow them to collect your information from our Services in some ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy if we have your consent to do so.
5. CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION
We do not knowingly collect children's personal information without parental consent. If you’re a child under 13 please do not provide name, address, phone number or email address that can personally identify you. If you are a parent of a child playing the Games or using our Services, you may review or have your child's personal information deleted and refuse the further collection of his/her personal information by contacting us at
privacy@lumiinteractive.com
.
6. YOUR RIGHTS
6.1 Accessing and deleting personal data held by Lumi
You can request a copy of or deletion of your game account data through our game. You can contact us through in-game chats or at
privacy@lumiinteractive.com
. We will aim to satisfy your request within 30 days, and if we cannot do so we will let you know.
6.2 Opting In or Out of marketing communication with Lumi
You can unsubscribe from promotional emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in our marketing emails. You can opt out of mobile push notifications in your device’s settings page.
If you want to stop receiving push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the app is not on, you can turn of push notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “Settings”. Many of our games also offer the ability to turn off push notifications in the in-game “Settings”. They’re usually titled as “reminders” in our Settings menu.
Please note that if you opt in or out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information about the games you are using from us, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or Lumi End User License Agreement.
7. PRIVACY POLICIES OF LINKED THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
We are not responsible for the ways in which third parties use your data (other than our partners acting under our guidance). Our Websites and Games may contain advertisements from third-party services that may link to their own websites or services. The full list of third party services and their privacy policies are located below.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these parties. If you have any questions about how these entities use your data, you should review their policies and contact them directly.
8. TRANSFER OF DATA
When you use our games, your personal data may be sent outside of the European Countries, for example, to the United States, Israel and Hong Kong and possibly other countries. When we transfer, store, and use personal data collected in the European Countries outside of the European Countries, we comply with our legal obligations and ensure that your personal data is subject to suitable safeguards (such as encrypting communication) or transferred to “approved” territories.
As a global company, we may transfer your personal data to our “Affiliated Entities,” located in European Countries and outside like United States, Israel and Hong Kong which are any other corporate entities under common ownership with Lumi, or to our business partners and service providers from time to time for our legitimate business purposes. For example, Lumi provides certain services to its Affiliates.
We store personal data about players and visitors to our sites on servers located in the United States, and we may also store this information on servers and equipment in other countries. Personal information collected in the European Countries may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the European Countries. The data we hold may also be processed by employees operating outside of the European Countries who work for us, one of our Affiliated Entities, or one of our business partners or service providers. This staff may be engaged in, among other things, marketing communication with players and product development. When we transfer your personal data internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner we describe here. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your data is transferred to or stored, used, or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.
Additionally, if we share with entities which are not subject to the Privacy Shield framework, and we make sure that these entities ensure an adequate level of protection, the transfer is supported by the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to a country outside the European Countries. These standard contractual clauses are available here:
ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer
.
9. DATA RETENTION
We’ll keep your information for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services, maintain our legitimate business operations, and/or exercise, defend or establish our rights.
How long we retain your personal information depends on why we collected it and how we use it, but we will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.
We will retain personal information about you and connected with your account and/or the Services you use from us for as long as you have an active account with us. We will take reasonable measures to delete this personal information if you delete your account. However, you acknowledge that we may retain some information after you have closed, or we have deleted, your account with us where necessary to enable us to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend, or establish our rights.
10. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
We work to protect your information but you as a player also have to take certain steps.
We implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to help protect the security of your data and to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance applicable laws.
It is important that you protect and maintain your Lumi account’s security and that you immediately tell us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you access our Services through Facebook and your account is hacked or otherwise compromised, this may lead to someone accessing or deleting your game accounts without your permission. So, be careful to keep your Facebook account information, including your social network account password, secure as well. We urge you to log out of your Lumi account and any social network account you have used to access our Services when you are finished using them.
If you have a customer service-related issue, please contact us through in-game chat.
11. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We let you know about any material changes to our Privacy Policy. If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will tell you and other players by placing a notice in-game or on our website or by sending you a notice to your e-mail address we have on file for you before the change becomes effective (and we will ask for your consent where required by law).

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).
