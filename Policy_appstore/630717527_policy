Privacy Policy
Document Last Updated: December 2, 2020
This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about our practices regarding the use, disclosure and collection of information that you may provide to Treemo, Inc., doing business as FlowVella ("FlowVella") . Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to FlowVella. This Privacy Policy applies to our mobile and desktop applications, or if you're visiting our web site at www.flowvella.com . (together, the "FlowVella Service").
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the
FlowVella Terms of Use
by this reference. In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, you should also read the
FlowVella Terms of Use
. Your use of the FlowVella Service constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy.  Whenever you submit information via this site or applications, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If required by applicable law in the jurisdiction where you are located or by agreement with us, we will not store or permit access to your personal information outside of the jurisdiction where you are located, except with your consent and then only to the extent permitted by that applicable law.  Your personally identifiable information will generally be stored and processed in the United States. By using the FlowVella Service and providing information to us, you consent to having your data in the U.S.  While in the U.S., your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities of the U.S. If you have questions about FlowVella's policies and practices regarding the use of affiliates and service providers in the U.S. to collect, use, disclose, or store personal information, please direct them to FlowVella at the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy.
FlowVella and its affiliates operate this and other websites and wireless internet sites ("sites") and mobile applications. FlowVella is committed to ensuring the privacy and protection of visitors to these FlowVella sites. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for sites owned or operated by FlowVella.
What is Personal Information?
Personal information is information about an identifiable individual and includes information which specifically identifies an individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, email address, or other account number, and information about that individual’s activities when directly linked to that person, such as information about his or her use of the FlowVella Service. Personal information also includes demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic location and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you, though FlowVella does not ask for date of birth, or gender. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise improve and augment the FlowVella Service.
Children’s Information
If you are under the age of 18, you may only use the FlowVella Service and disclose information to us with your parent’s or guardian’s express consent. Please carefully review this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian and make sure you understand it. We collect very limited personal information through the FlowVella Service from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us for use with the FlowVella Service. If you are a child under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself if such parental consent has not been obtained.  Further, please do not send any personal information other than what is necessary to participate in the FlowVella Service.
In the event that FlowVella learns that it has collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that FlowVella might have any information from or about a child under 13 in violation of this paragraph, please contact FlowVella's privacy officer at support@flowvella.com.
