MedTracker Privacy
Except as noted below, MedTracker does not knowingly send any of the information in the application or database to anyone including ourselves.
MedTracker stores, in its local database, all information that is shown in the various views.
Depending on your device settings the database file and exports may be backed up by Apple services to iCloud. If the database is backed up or sent to iCloud, then Apple’s privacy policies apply.
MedTracker uses Google AdMob to provide revenue to the developers. Google’s AdMob policies can be found by searching the internet or
looking here
. This revenue is important to be able to maintain MedTracker and handle Apple updates each year. We do not provide any information about data in your database to Google, but Google does use a unique identifier to improve advertising.
If you have email setup on your device, certain versions of MedTracker can,  at the users request, create a debug email report.
This debug email report contains the application log, a screen grab of the current view, information about your device including a unique identifier, and a place for you to describe your a problem with MedTracker. The application log can contain information about the medicines you are taking.
The email is not sent automatically, meaning you must manually tap the ‘Send’ button. Prior to sending you may edit or delete any of the information in the email.
More information about the unique identifier can be found by searching the internet for ‘UIDevice’ and ‘identifierForVendor’.
All information sent to developers is used only for the purpose of debugging MedTracker. We do not sell or otherwise distribute this information.
It is possible to use MedTracker without providing any personally identifiable information.  For example, the patient name is not required and may be omitted or you can use an alias or nickname.
