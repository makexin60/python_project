Our Sites and Services are intended for customers and users located in the United States. If you are not a U.S. customer or user, please visit www.vtech.com to find the appropriate site for your use.

Remember that your use of the Sites and Services is also subject to the Terms of Use applicable to that Site or Service, which incorporate this Privacy Policy.
1. Types of information we collect, how we use it, and whom we share it with
1.1. Our Sites
Except for certain areas of our Sites that are limited to our retail dealers and distributors or the Service, you need not "sign-in" or register to browse our Sites. However, some information, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, may be collected as part of your browsing activities by cookies or similar technology, as described in Section 3, below.
Transactional Data:
In the event that you choose to make an inquiry or engage in a transaction while accessing our Sites, we will ask that you provide certain personal information (PI) that is needed to respond to the inquiry or complete the transaction. We will use the PI only for that purpose and for the purposes described within this Privacy Policy. For example, if you ask us for additional information about a product, we will ask for your email address, phone number, name, and model number in order that we may respond to your inquiry. If you purchase one of our products, we will ask that you provide us with the information needed to process your order, charge your credit card account, send you messages regarding your order and deliver the product you have purchased. Such information may include your first and last name, credit card number, billing and shipping address, email address and telephone number. If you choose to create an account with us, we will also ask you to create a user ID and password; however, creation of an account is optional and is not required to register a product or complete a transaction.
In fulfilling any inquiry or transaction ordered by you, we may employ affiliates or third party companies to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include order fulfillment, package delivery, postal and email delivery, customer service, data collection, storage, data analysis, and credit processing. We may also employ affiliates or third party companies to perform marketing on our behalf, such as sending you information about products or services we think you may be interested in. The third parties we contract for these purposes have limited access to your PI to perform these functions on our behalf and may not use it for other purposes.
Registration Data:
We also provide customers with the opportunity to register their VTech products and give us additional information about themselves, including information about recent purchases and certain demographic data. We refer to this as "Registration Data." Providing Registration Data is optional, and we do not require that you give us this information to complete a purchase, receive warranty services or browse our Sites.
If you choose to provide Registration Data, we may use it, alone or in conjunction with other information, to identify other products or services that we think you may be interested in purchasing and to send you information about those other products or services.
If you do not wish to receive these marketing messages from us, you can so indicate by filling the “opt-out” box located on the Contact Us page.
If you did not opt-out, you may receive from us periodic marketing emails regarding products or services that we think may be of interest to you. You may also opt-out of receiving these marketing emails by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email received. It may take us up to 10 days to complete this process, as permitted by law. If you opt-out, you will still continue to receive non-marketing emails from VTech related to your use of the VTech sites and services.
1.2. Our Services
Account Data:
If you activate the Services, as part of your account creation for the Web Apps or Mobile Apps, we will ask you to provide certain PI, including your name, physical address, email address, and telephone number (“Account Data”). VTech does not itself collect or obtain your credit card information. To complete the payment or purchase process (for example, for cloud recording subscriptions), you will be directed to a third party payment site, such as Paypal. For more information on Paypal’s privacy practices, please see their privacy policies, available at

Usage Data:
Our Services are designed to allow you to connect certain compatible devices (for example, our monitors and sensors) to the Services. Once the Services are enabled, your use of the Services with a connected device will automatically report certain Usage Data to our servers.

The exact type of information collected from each product will vary depending on the product type.
If video and audio recording devices are used as part of the Services, your use of the Services may also generate additional Usage Data, such as audio and/or video streaming and recording, other audio and/or video content, and images and/or snapshots. This video, audio, and image content will be transmitted to, and stored on, the servers of VTech or its service providers. The content may also be stored, processed and analyzed by VTech to provide the Services, including to provide certain notifications to the user, such as sound or motion detection alerts, or if the account is accessed by an unfamiliar mobile device.
Moreover, you can enable certain storage and retrieval functions as part of the Services. You may also choose to not enable these functions. If these storage and retrieval functions are enabled, VTech will store your Usage Data to allow access by you to this information, through your account and through the Web Apps and Mobile App
Customization Information:
Your use of the Services will also generate a third type of data (“Customization Information”) that will be used to customize your user experience, and may include information such as patterns of your use of the services.
1.3. Use of Information Collected From Our Services

Other instances of when VTech may share your information are described below in Section 6.
2. Retention and protection of your information
The security of your personal information is important to VTech, and VTech is committed to handling your information carefully. We will retain your PI only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required by law. We use Transport Layer Security Technology ("TLS") to encrypt the PI and Registration Data you transmit to us through our site. Further, to ensure that your PI and Registration Data are secure, we store it in a database with restricted access.
VTech also protects your personal information by requiring users of our Sites and Services to verify their identities with unique login information before they can access or edit their account information or settings. If you select and establish an account with us in connection with your use of Sites or Services, you are responsible for keeping that login information confidential. Do not share your login information with anyone else.
3. Cookies and similar technologies
Some of the pages on our Sites and Services use "cookies" to help us better service visitors to our Sites and users of our Services. Cookies are brief text files transmitted by a website to the hard drive of your computer when you click on a page. Should you return to the page at a later time, your computer will transmit the text message back to the website server to permit the server to recall previous visits to our Sites or Services or to keep track of a transaction in progress. You may set your browser to reject cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Doing this, however, could diminish your use of our Sites or Services by preventing the use of certain features including the purchasing process. Cookies are not linked to Registration Data.
For website analytics, we use two methods of tracking user behavior. Server log files and javascript tracking tags are used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement and gather other information. These tracking methods provide us information such as internet protocol addresses, browser type used, Internet Service Provider information, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time, number of visitors, geographic location and ecommerce data. On occasion, we may share this information with our business partners and advertisers. The contents of these tracking methods may be linked to your IP address or other information collected via our Sites and Services, including Google Analytics javascript tracking tags.
Do Not Track Signals:
Our systems do not currently recognize or respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.
Web Site Data Collection:
To the best of our knowledge, third parties may not, without contractual obligations with us, collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different Web sites when a consumer uses our Sites and Services.
4. Third party content and links
Our Sites and Services may contain links to other third-party websites. If you choose to visit these other sites from our Sites or Services, VTech is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these other sites. The third-party promotions or advertisements displayed on our Sites or Services may also contain cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our Sites or Services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third parties to learn about their privacy practices.
Third party vendors, including Google, show VTech advertisements on third-party websites. Such third party vendors use cookies to serve advertisements based on your prior visits to our Sites. You may opt out third party vendors’ use of cookies by visiting our cookie statement.
5. Children
We do not sell products for purchase by children. All of our products (including products intended to be used by children) are intended to be purchased by adults. If you are under 18 years old and you want to buy something on our website, you must have an adult buy it for you. We have not designed our website to encourage transactions with, or to obtain information from, children. VTech respects the sensitive nature of children's privacy online. Therefore, if we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly delete any information collected from that user, and if we learn that a user under 18 years old made a purchase through our Sites without adult involvement, the order will not be processed.
6. Other cases when we may share your information
If required by law or legal proceedings (including court orders, subpoenas, statutes and regulations) or to enforce our legal rights, VTech may disclose the information of a customer or user collected on the Sites and Services. This includes investigation into actual or suspected breach of this Policy or our Terms of Use, illegal activity, fraud, intellectual property infringement, or threats of violence or other harm.

For most of our Services, we act as a “data controller” or “business”, however there are some products and features where PayPal may also act as a “data processor” or “service provider” when providing services to our Partners and Merchants.  The “data controller” or “business” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that has the control over the purposes and means by which the data processing is performed.  The “data processor” or “service provider” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that processes the Personal Information for the data controller, for the data controller’s specific purposes, and as otherwise permitted under applicable data protection laws.
Non-Account Holders and Fastlane Profile Users
Our Services may be accessed by individuals without a PayPal or Xoom account. We will collect Personal Information from you even if you are a non-account holder when you use our Services, such as when you use our Pay Without a PayPal account, use Unbranded Payment Services (e.g., Braintree and Zettle), use a Fastlane profile, or when a non-accountholder receives a payment through the Visa+ service from a PayPal account holder (“Recipient”). If you Pay Without a PayPal account, we may link your transaction information with your PayPal account, if you have one at the time you use the Service without logging in, or if you create a PayPal account later.
With a Fastlane profile, individuals can store their payment methods and other Personal Information with PayPal so that they can complete the checkout process faster,  create a store or loyalty account, or facilitate other transactions at participating Partners and Merchants with payment card, contact information, shipping data or other data they save in their Fastlane profile as relevant to the specific interaction, participating Partner or Merchant, all without having to manually input payment method details and other Personal Information each time they checkout ("Fastlane").

We will also collect transaction and other Partner or Merchant data related to your purchases and other Partner or Merchant interactions when you use Fastlane. If you have a Fastlane profile, we may recognize you as a Fastlane user when you shop on the participating Partners’ and Merchants’ sites, and we may prompt you to engage in participating Partner or Merchant interactions, such as registering for a store or loyalty account using your Fastlane profile information. If you choose to interact with participating Partners or Merchants through Fastlane, you agree to let PayPal disclose your Fastlane profile information to the Participating Partners and Merchants and their service providers, and to facilitate your transaction and shopping experience on the participating Partners and Merchants sites.
The Visa+ Service enables eligible customers with a PayPal account to send and receive money to and from Venmo and third-party Visa+-enabled digital wallets (“Visa+”).

Such authorities include courts, governments, law enforcement, and regulators. We may also be required to provide other third parties information about your use of our Services, for example to comply with card association rules, to investigate or enforce violations of our user agreement or to prevent physical harm or illegal activity.

Based on your account settings, the information shown to other Users may include your username, profile photo, first and last name, email, phone number, city and state, month and year of PayPal account creation, and any additional information you include in the details or “about you” section of your account.
Other Users if you have a business profile
.  If you have a business profile, we will display a payment link and disclose certain information about you to other Users, including your name or business name, profile picture or logo, and the city associated with your PayPal account, as well as total time selling with us, total number of followers, and total number of unique Users that have paid you in the past year.
If you have a business profile, you can choose to display other information to other Users, such as your street address, phone number, email and website, in accordance with your business profile settings.
Linked accounts
, for example any social media accounts you asked us to link or when you link an account with another bank or
financial institutions,
card account, or aggregator

Partners and Merchants, their service providers and others involved in a transaction

We may also disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants to enable their use of our Services to facilitate your transactions.  For example, when you visit a participating Partner or Merchant site or app, the Partner or Merchant can check whether you are a user of PayPal services and present a recommended payment method to you to simplify your checkout process.

, we may disclose your Personal Information to Partners and Merchants that you and we interact with, to help ourselves and Partners and Merchants personalize services and offers so you can have a better and more relevant experience.  Personal Information we disclose includes, for example, products, sizes, preferences, and styles we think you’ll like.

To opt-out of disclosures or Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences, log into your PayPal account and edit your preferences in the Data and Privacy setting.
If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate, but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchant for personalized shopping experiences.
Please note
that Personal Information disclosed to Partners and Merchants (or their
service providers) involved in a transaction is subject to the Partners' and Merchants' own privacy policies and
procedures. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of Partners and Merchants.
Other third parties
, for example we disclose Personal Information to advertising platforms at your direction, or security service providers to help prevent unauthorized access to our Services.
Please be aware that these parties’ privacy notice applies to the Personal Information that you share directly with them
. For example, we use Google’s reCAPTCHA to prevent misuse of our Services, when you access our mobile application. We may also use Google Address Autofill to ensure accuracy of your address. Google’s
Privacy Policy
and
Terms of Use
apply to the Personal Information you share with them.
Buyers or in connection with business transfer
,
for example if we are involved in a merger, a purchase or sale of all or part of our business or assets, including receivables and debts, we may disclose, under appropriate data protection terms, your Personal Information to an interested or actual buyer of those business or assets. If PayPal or a significant portion of PayPal’s assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Information may also be disclosed.
How long does PayPal store your Personal Information?
We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or is permitted in context of the purpose for which it was collected and consistent with applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention period is as follows:
Personal Information used for the ongoing relationship between you and PayPal is stored for the duration of the relationship plus a period of 10 years, unless we need to keep it longer, such as:
a legal obligation or compliance with laws to which we are subject is retained consistent with the applicable law, such as under applicable bankruptcy laws and AML obligations
litigation, investigations, audit and compliance practices, or to protect against legal claims.
We retain biometric data for as long as needed or permitted given the purpose for which it was collected and no more than 3 years after your account closes, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?
When you interact with our Services, open email we send you, or visit a third-party website for which we provide Services, we and our partners use cookies and other tracking technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, and widgets (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a user, customize your online experiences and online content, including to serve you interest-based advertising, perform analytics; mitigate risk and prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Services.
We use Cookies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and generate inferences as described above.
You can disable or decline some Cookies for our Services. But, since some parts of our service rely on Cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.
Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.
If you want to know more about how we use cookies, please review our
Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Your Data Protection Rights
Your rights to access, correction, deletion, and restriction to use or share your Personal Information.
Under applicable data protection law, depending upon the jurisdiction in which you reside and subject to applicable exceptions and definitional differences among various state laws, you may have certain rights about how your Personal Information is collected, stored, used and shared.
We recognize the importance of your ability to control the use of your Personal Information and provide several ways for you to exercise your rights to access (right to know your information), right to know third-parties to which we have disclosed Personal Information, correction, deletion (erasure), and to restrict certain information (right to opt-out of sharing and right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information).
Certain state laws also provide residents of those states with the right to opt out of the “sale” (disclosing Personal Information in exchange for money or other consideration) or “sharing” (disclosing Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising) of your Personal Information or use of your Personal Information for certain types of targeted advertising.  Global Privacy Control settings is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. PayPal does not respond to the Global Privacy Control signal because we do not sell or share your data.
We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights; although, certain personalized services for PayPal customers may not provide the same level of personalization with limited data sharing. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we handle your
Privacy Rights
.
How do you exercise your rights?
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information,
contact us
or submit your request from your account settings. If you have a PayPal account, you can exercise your privacy rights by accessing “Data and Privacy” from account settings in the PayPal app.
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information in your Fastlane profile,
contact us
or submit your request from your Fastlane profile management portal.
Even if you do not have a PayPal account (for example, where you use Pay without a PayPal account), you can submit a request for access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at the number provided in our
Contact Information
section.
We’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.
Your
right to request a copy of the Personal Information
. If you want to request the data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months, you have choices:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and submit a request
Call or contact us
and request that we provide you with the data we’ve collected.
Your right
to correct your Personal Information:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and correct any information that you've previously added. For example, you can edit your addresses in your settings
Call or contact us
and request that we correct specific information
Your right
to delete your Personal Information:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and delete any information that you've previously added. For example, you may delete your non-primary addresses in your settings
Call us or contact us
and request that we delete specific information
Close your PayPal or Xoom account or Fastlane profile
If you close your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile, or request that we delete Personal Information, we still need to keep some Personal Information as explained in
How long does PayPal store your Personal Information
section so we can:
Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the user agreement or other contract you have with us
Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity
Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech
Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our Services
Comply with laws and other legal or governmental processes
California also offers a right to opt out of “Selling” and “Sharing” Personal Information. The Global Privacy Control setting is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their personal information. PayPal does not respond to these settings because we do not sell or share data. Some personal information collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution are subject to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our
Consumer Privacy Notice
for more information about their rights under US federal law.
Understanding your choices
You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.
Choose how we collect Personal Information
You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function.
For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.
Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information
If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.
You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.
Choose what we disclose with other Users
Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.
Choose what we share with Partners and Merchants for Personalized Shopping
Unless we are required by law to obtain your consent, we share Personal Information collected after November 27, 2024 (or from earlier if you consent) for personalized shopping experiences. Personal Information we disclose includes, for example, products, preferences, sizes, and styles we think you’ll like. To opt-out of Personal Information sharing with Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences, log into your PayPal account and edit your preferences in the Data and Privacy setting. If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.
Choose how we communicate with you
Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Fastlane profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.
You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal or Fastlane marketing email, opt-out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.
You won’t be able to opt-out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account or Fastlane profile's status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.
How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?
We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and account/Fastlane profile registration information and verifying that the Personal Information we maintain about you is accurate and current. We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that we share with a third-party based on a linked account connection that you have authorized.
Can Children Use Our Services?
We do not knowingly collect information, including Personal Information, from children under the age of 13 or other individuals who are not legally allowed to use our Services. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Information from someone not allowed to use our Services, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data.
Please
contact us
if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from someone not allowed to use our Services.
We do not sell to third parties for money, or share Personal Information of anyone under 16 years of age, for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising.

CCPA California Notice at Collection
Most of the Personal Information we collect is subject to federal and state privacy laws that apply to financial institutions. To the extent the Personal Information is not subject to these federal and state financial privacy laws and to the extent it is collected in California about California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may apply. The following section pertains only to Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA (“CCPA personal information”) and makes statements that reference unique definitions and requirements of law.
This CCPA California Notice at Collection describes: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “CCPA personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose CCPA personal information for a business purpose, and/or (b) “share” CCPA personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or (c) “sell” such CCPA personal information, as applicable.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the sharing or disclosure of CCPA personal information by a business to a third party, for the targeting of advertising to a consumer, based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s CCPA activity across businesses, websites, applications, or services, other than those with which a consumer uses or directs a business to internally disclose CCPA personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties. “Selling” is defined as the disclosure of CCPA personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, but does not apply to such disclosures when a consumer uses or directs a business to intentionally disclose CCPA personal information or interact with one or more third parties.
We do not sell or share your CCPA personal information, including any Sensitive CCPA personal information, outside the exceptions.
We also do not sell or share, and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any CCPA personal information of anyone under 16 years of age.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose CCPA personal information, please see the “Categories of Personal Information We Collect”, “How is Personal Information used,” and “Do We Disclose Personal Information” sections.
