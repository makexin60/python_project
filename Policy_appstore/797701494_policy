Information we collect
We may collect information about the Services you use and how you use them, such as the selections you make on our
Services. We collect PII, DII, and log information about your interactions as described below.
Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used to identify or contact you online or offline,
such as your name, address, email, phone number, photos or audio data, and payment information, or data that is linked
to such identifiers. The Service may collect PII when it is provided to us, such as when you use our Services, attempt
to contact us, submit a resume or job application, or connect with us on social media or one of our partners. For
example, you may see a "Log in with..." button, which means we request PII from a partner to streamline the login the
process. You will likely be presented with a "request for permission" screen by a third party asking to share your ID,
profile picture, and other listed information with us.
We may also create or collect device-identifiable information (DII), such as cookies, unique device and advertising
identifiers, statistical identifiers, usernames, and similar identifiers that are linkable to a browser or device. From
these platforms, we may also receive other information, such as your IP address, user agent, timestamps, precise and
imprecise geolocation, sensor data, apps, fonts, battery life information, and screen size.
Our Services also collect information about your interactions, including navigation paths, search queries, crashes,
timestamps, purchases, clicks and shares, and referral URLs. We may combine this data with PII and DII. For efficiency's
sake, information about your interactions may be transmitted to our servers while you are not using the app. We may also
partner with third parties that collect additional information - please see their privacy policies for more details and
see below for your choices regarding these parties.

In case of a sale or asset transfer - If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information, including PII collected from you through your use of our Services, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice on the Services.

GDPR Classifications
Many types of data we process qualify for multiple legal bases for processing under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Below is the primary legal basis for each type of data that we process:
We obtain consent for the processing of data necessary for chatrooms and any optional profile information, such as a
description, gender, or birthday. Where users log in with social media accounts, those companies have obtained consent
on our behalf to use that data as described above. Consent is also obtained to add and engage with friends and other
scenarios as appropriate.
We have a legitimate interest in conducting analytics, measurement of usage and conversions, and game telemetrics to
improve our services. We and our processors have multiple measures in place to minimize the privacy impact.
We have a legitimate interest in storing users' purchase history for the purpose of providing users help in fixing
purchase and payment issues.
We have a legitimate interest in enabling third party ads and data collection on our sites and apps to help provide a
more customized ad experience for our users and site visitors. Our reputable partners provide opt outs and numerous
other privacy measures to minimize the privacy impact of online ads.
We have a legitimate interest in periodic email and direct marketing, to inform registered users of updates and offers.
We make clear disclosures when users sign up and offer opt outs for anyone not interested.
It is contractually necessary to process your username, email, password, cookie data, IP address, game network IDs, game
information (including earned quests and favorite games/game shares), and similar information to fulfill our obligations
in the terms of service to provide you with high quality games and a social game network from ourselves and our
partners.
Third Parties
While we strive to work with reputable companies with good privacy practices, this Policy does not apply to services
offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you on the Services. We
also do not control the privacy policies and your privacy settings on third-party sites, including social networks. We
may use third parties to help offer you more tailored ads and better Services, such as obtaining analytics about the
users of our site and to help tailor advertising to your preferences. We also share your data with our game partners to
provide you access to more games. For further information, please see the relevant privacy policies for each third party
and industry codes of conduct.
Additional Advertising Service Providers
When you use our website, we share information that we collect from you, including IP address, information about your browser or operating system, or your email (in hashed form), with our identity partners/service providers, including LiveRamp Inc and Pubmatic, Inc. These companies return an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. To opt out of this use, please visit:
https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out
https://pubmatic.com/legal/opt-out/
Choice
If you wish to cancel your account, you can do so by accessing our platform or contacting us for assistance with the
process. Our email is included at the end of this privacy policy.
If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with us, you have the right to
request removal of unwanted information that you post onto our Services (e.g., comments or a forum) by contacting us at
the email at the end of this privacy policy, stating you reside in California. This does not ensure complete or
comprehensive removal of the posted content.
Like many other companies, we do not honor DNT flags but instead offer other choices with respect to third parties. Many
third parties participate in self-regulation to offer you a choice regarding receiving targeted ads. Please note that
you'll still see generic ads after opting out, but they won't be based on your activities online. On the web, you can
opt out of participating companies by visiting the following sites:
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/
http://optout.aboutads.info/
http://youronlinechoices.eu/
https://server.cpmstar.com/optout.aspx?iso_code=CA
https://cdn.districtm.ca/optout.html
https://platform.xandr.com/privacy-center/opt_out
https://www.viglink.com/opt-out/
If you wish to similarly opt out of cross-app advertising on mobile devices, you can enable the Limit Ad Tracking flag
on the device. Enabling Limit Ad Tracking sends a flag to third parties that you wish to opt out of targeted advertising
on that device, and major mobile platforms require companies to honor this flag. Screenshots on how to find these
options on various devices are available here:
http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices
. To learn how to opt
out on other devices such as video game consoles, please visit the platform's privacy policies for more information.
Users subject to the GDPR also have the right to access their data, rectify mistakes, erase their data, restrict certain
processing (i.e., opt out), move their data, withdraw consent, and lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Accessing and updating your information
If you wish to access, update, or delete your PII, please reach out to us at
privacy@armorgames.com
. We may ask you to
verify your identity before we can act on your request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require that you
create an account with us. You must provide us with sufficient information to verify your identity, however we will only
use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity.
In some cases, we may have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes and therefore will deny
your request to delete the information.
Under the CCPA, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about the collection and use
of your PII over the previous 12 months. We may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request,
however upon such verification, we will disclose to you:
The categories of PII collected about you.
The categories of sources for the PII we collect about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that PII.
The categories of third parties to whom we share that Personal Information.
The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you.
If we sold or disclosed your PII for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing
Sales identifying the categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
Disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Non Discrimination under the CCPA
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. To that end, and unless permitted by
law, we will not:
Deny you goods or services;
Charge you different prices for goods or services;
Impose penalties;
Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services; or
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level of quality of goods or services.
Information security
We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of
information we hold and undertake reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and
availability protections. However, since no software or storage system is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee for the
security of your information associated with the Services, or any other service for that matter. You can help protect
your account information by using unique and hard-to-guess passwords. To provide users access to their progress and
purchases, we retain data for up to 10 years since the date of user's last login.
Children Under 13
We do not knowingly collect information for any child under the age of 13. If you are the parent of a child under the
age of 13 and have a concern regarding your child's information on our Services, please contact us at the email provided
at the end of this Policy.
Changes
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Policy changes on this page, including material
changes. Please check back periodically to view changes to our privacy policy. Our most recent change focuses on updates
for the CCPA.
