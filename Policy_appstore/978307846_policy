This page is our Privacy Policy
A Privacy Policy tells you how we use your personal data, so you know what happens with it when you or other people give it to us. Personal data is any data that can identify you, either on its own or used with other data.
This Privacy Policy will help you understand your privacy rights, how and why we need to process your personal data, and how you can get in touch with us if needed.
Processing personal data involves any activity to do with that data, for example collection, storage, editing, and deletion.
This Privacy Policy also applies to children’s personal data that we may collect and use to assist with a service provided by us. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy we view a “child” to be any user who is under the age of 18.
We have presented this information in different sections so you can access the information you need more easily.

Personal data? What is that?
Anything that can identify you is your personal data. This can include your name, age, a photo of you, your email address, where you live, or your online gamertag.
There are some types of data we must be particularly careful with, known as ‘special category data.’ This could include data related to your health, or religious beliefs.
Sometimes we have to share personal data with the police to assist with their investigations.
Privacy and data protection laws
We are committed to complying with privacy and data protection laws in all countries in which we operate, to the extent that such laws are applicable to us.
We operate different websites, Apps (web and mobile) and an online retail shop (together referred to as the OS Sites and/or Services).
If you are accessing our OS Sites and/or Services from a location outside of the UK or the European Economic Area (the EEA), please refer to the section "Additional information for international users (outside of the UK or EEA)" at the end of this Privacy Policy for important additional information.

Make a privacy complaint
We're keen to work with New Zealanders to get their privacy queries and complaints sorted quickly and fairly. Before you complain to us, you need to
complain directly to the business or organisation that you feel has breached your privacy.
If you haven’t been able to work out your privacy issue with them,
then you can complain to us
. We aim to ensure that you're treated fairly, whatever your background or circumstances. We work in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1993.

Privacy Amendment Bill: what you need to know
The Privacy Amendment Bill is making its way through Parliament, and we know organisations are starting to think about how this will impact them. We’ve put together key information on the Bill, which we’ll update as it progresses.

Agencies: report a data breach
If you're an organisation and have a privacy breach that is likely to cause anyone serious harm, you are legally required to notify us and any affected persons as soon as you can.
As a guide, our expectation is that a breach notification should be made to our Office no later than 72 hours after agencies are aware of a notifiable privacy breach.
