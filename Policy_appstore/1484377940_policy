Your agreement to the foregoing takes place when you "accept" or "allow" or Ã¢â‚¬Å“go to" (or other similar terms) our application on a Social Networking Site or the transfer of information to Latina Dating from such site.

How do we respond to Do Not Track signals?

Application users who send Do Not Track signals will not experience an adverse effect on their experience with the Application.
How long do you keep the information I've provided you?
We keep the information you have given us for as long as your Ad Profile stays active or hidden.

Please be aware that it may take several hours for any custom changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the system. Please also note that changing or deleting your information through the 'Notifications' section of the system, or opting-out of email notifications from us, will only change or delete the data in our database for the purpose of future activities and communications.

Your PII will be deleted from our systems (other than records kept as required by applicable law or for general backup, archival or record keeping purposes) if your account is inactive for 24 months.
Unsolicited Contact (SPAM)
Latina Dating does not send unsolicited email at any time. Any abuse or evidence of unsolicited email that appears to have been initiated from us, directly or indirectly, should be brought to the immediate attention of our compliance officer by using the Contact Form.
Do you monitor online behavior?
Our users communicate with each other through Application chat Messaging. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor members' private exchanges, we reserve the right to do so if we suspect users of being under the age of 18 or of using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy. Submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the site.
Security
We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. To safeguard the confidentiality and security of your PII, we use industry standard practices and technologies including but not limited to "firewalls", encrypted transmission via SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and strong data encryption of sensitive personal information when it is stored to disk. However, because the internet is an open network, we cannot warrant or guarantee that your PII is safe from unauthorised access or use. Non-PII and PII may be kept on computer systems operated by third parties. We will take reasonable precautions against unauthorised access and disclosure by those third parties.
Access to PII
