Privacy Policy
1. Analytics & data collection
We do not use any analytics or other data collecting services inside of our apps. We do not track or monitor your activity in any way.
2. In-App purchases
None of our apps offer in-app purchases. Instead, premium versions are offered.
3. Advertisements
All of our free apps use advertisements supplied by Google. These advertisements are all COPPA compliant. In case that there is no data connection available, we display advertisements for our own apps.
4. Parental gate
Any action that takes the user out of an app or connects to an app store is protected by a parental gate to protect young children
and keep them within the app.
This does not apply
to
Google advertisements.
