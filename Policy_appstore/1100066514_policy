Really amazing service, wish there was something similar for the kids when they’re not well! As a first time dog owner it’s brilliant to be able to live chat with a vet and get some advice at any time of day or night.

FAQs
VIEW ALL
What qualifications do your GP vets hold?
add
All our GP vets hold a veterinary degree recognised by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), are licensed to practice in the UK and have a minimum of 5 years clinical experience.
When should I use PawSquad?
add
PawSquad can be used in any scenario where you are unsure about the right course of action for the health and wellbeing of your pet. Let us help you with anything from small niggles to emergencies.
How long will I have to wait to see a vet?
add
We aim to get you connected to an expert as quickly as possible. On average, we connect members to a vet within just 47 seconds. Or alteratively you can book a time that suits you.
Do I have to have a video consult?
add
No, we reccomend video as it helps our vets get a more accurate understanding of you and your pet. However you can start the consult in text chat, audio (like a phone call) or video. We even allow you to change format during the consult (Just like a Zoom Call!)
How long does a PawSquad consult last?
add
There is no strict time limit for a PawSquad consult. We encourage you to take as little or long as you need to discuss your concerns with our vets.
Can your vets prescribe my pet medication?
add
Current regulations do not yet allow vets to prescribe prescription-only medicines online. Therefore, we will need to refer you to a physical vet practice for any prescription medicines.
