Where we ask you for your consent, you are free to deny your consent and the denial will have no negative consequences for you. You are also free to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. If you have granted us consent to use your personal data, we will use it only for the purposes specified in the consent form.

Purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction
.
Personal data may be disclosed to third parties in connection with a transaction, such as a merger, sale of our assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business, or in the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceedings.
Law enforcement, regulators and other parties for legal reasons
.
Personal data may be disclosed to third parties as required by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our legal claims or to protect the security or integrity of our Services; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ROUVY, our partners, employees, or others.
We will store personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect the personal data, in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.

For example, national commercial or financial codes may require retaining certain information for up to 10 years.
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal data when you use our Services. However, no system of security can be 100% secure and so we cannot guarantee in all cases the security of the information that we process.  In the event we learn that personal data is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take steps to investigate and comply with notification obligations and take other steps in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
As we are located in Australia, we transfer personal data from other countries to Australia. Depending on your place of residence or location, this may mean that your personal data will be stored in a jurisdiction that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal data than your resident jurisdiction.
If you are located in the European Union, the following applies:
To safeguard the direct collection of personal data from data subjects located in the European Union to third parties outside the European Union and the European Economic Area, we have entered into contracts that are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses with our European affiliates for the benefit of the affected data subjects. Please contact
gdpr@rouvy.com
for more information.
Before transferring your personal data to a third party outside the European Union and European Economic Area, we will enter into contracts based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard your personal data.
If you wish to inquire further about the safeguards we use, please contact us using the details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy.
If you are located in Australia or New Zealand, the following applies:
As mentioned above at ‘With whom do we share your personal data?’, your personal data may be shared with our affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties, who may be located in a different country to you (“Overseas Recipients”). These Overseas Recipients may be located in various jurisdictions, such as those listed on Annex 2, which may not afford the same protections as in Australia or New Zealand, as applicable.
Where your personal data is transferred to Overseas Recipients, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Overseas Recipients will handle your personal data in accordance with:
Australian Laws: the Australian Privacy Principles (“APPs”) and the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Australian Privacy Act”).
New Zealand Laws:  the New Zealand Privacy Principles (“IPPs”) and the New Zealand Privacy Act (NZ Privacy Act).

We also use clear gifs in HTML-based e-mails sent to our newsletter subscribers to track which e-mails are opened and which links are clicked by them. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of our Services. You can set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain these technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it.
Additionally, we support the self-regulatory principles for online advertising (Principles) published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest-based advertising purposes. More information about these Principles can be found
http://www.aboutads.info/
.
If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and third parties that participate in the DAA program and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, please follow the instructions at
www.aboutads.info/choices
, or
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
to place an “opt-out” cookie on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.  Opt-out cookies only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt-out of interest-based advertisements across all your browsers and devices, you will need to opt-out on each browser on each device you actively use. If you delete cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again.
Please note that when you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on the Services.  It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests.  We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of the Services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.
