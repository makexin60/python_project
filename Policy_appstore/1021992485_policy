In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.
We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.
We take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party.
We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.
Our policy complies with UK law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regards to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at
www.knowyourprivacyrights.org
In brief, if you think that we are holding your PII, then you can make a request to us. We will verify the request and if we do, you have a number of rights in relation to that information.
You can ask us for: access to it, to rectify, erase and restrict it, to object to it being processed (used in any way), or to withdraw consent for it to be processed.
We must also tell you the reasons for which we are holding (processing) your PII data, the categories of data that we are holding, how long we plan to hold it and details of any recipients.
In certain circumstances, you can also ask us for a copy of your PII, in machine format, to allow for the transference of the data, to another organisation. Please contact

Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.
The basis on which we process information about you.
The law requires us to determine under which of six defined terms we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.
If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant, then we shall immediately stop processing your data.
If the basis changes, then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.
1.          Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you
When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.
In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information.
We may use it in order to:
1.1.       verify your identity for security purposes.
1.2.       sell products to you.
1.3.       provide you with our services.
1.4.       provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website.
We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.
Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.
We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.
2.          Information we process with your consent
Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our Club, including our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.
The Club’s Preference Centre provides all supporters with the opportunity to define and control communications that they receive from the Club. Once registered, it is possible to log in to the Preference Centre to change or delete any of the information.
Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.
Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.
Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.
If you have given us explicit permission to do so, such as in the Preference Centre options, we may from time to time pass your name and contact information to selected associates whom we consider may provide services or products you would find useful.
We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent, or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.
You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us by email at
dpo@cardiffcityfc.co.uk
or by sending a letter to the Data Protection Officer at the Club. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.
3.          Information we process because we have a legal obligation
We are subject to the law like everyone else. Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.
For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.
This may include your personal information.
Specific uses of information you provide to us.
4.          Information provided on the understanding that it will be shared with a third party

In posting personal information, it is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy level of every person who might use it.
We do not specifically use this information except to allow it to be displayed or shared.
Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control over what any individual third party may do with it. We accept no responsibility for their actions at any time.
Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us to retain it, then at our discretion we may agree to your request to delete personal information that you have posted. You can make a request by contacting us at

6.          Complaints regarding content on our website
If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate your complaint.
If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate.
If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.
7.          Information relating to your method of payment
At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of our Ticketing or Retail Partners. That page may be branded to look like a page on our website, but it is not controlled by us.
The security of your Credit Card data is of paramount importance to us.
Card payment is taken using Optomany managed service. As a member of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), Optomany is dedicated to ensuring merchants and customers alike are protected against card data fraud. Transaction authorisation, settlement and management with PAYware Ocius is delivered through a PCI DSS Level 1 certified payment processing infrastructure.
Optomany's solution includes tokenisation, which eliminates the need to store sensitive cardholder details by replacing the card details with a unique reference code.
Your credit card details are not held on our servers.
Please ensure that you are in agreement with the terms, conditions, Privacy and Cookie Policies on these payment websites before interacting with any such website or making any purchase.
8.          Information about your direct debit
When you agree to set up a direct debit arrangement, the information you give to us is passed to our own bank for processing according to our instructions. We do not keep a copy.
We are registered under the direct debit guarantee scheme. This provides for the customer's bank to refund disputed payments without question, pending further investigation. Direct debits can only be set up for payments to beneficiaries that are approved originators of direct debits. In order to be approved, these beneficiaries are subjected to careful vetting procedures. Once approved, they are required to give indemnity guarantees through their banks.
9.          Job application and employment
If you send us information in connection with a job application, we may keep it for up to six months in case we decide to contact you at a later date.
If we employ you, we collect information about you and your work from time to time throughout the period of your employment. This information will be used only for purposes directly relevant to your employment. Further detail is contained in our Staff Manual which is only available to employed staff.
10.          Sending a message to our support team
When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need.
We do not keep any personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name or email address.
11.      Complaining
When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us. We use that information to resolve your complaint.
We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.
12.      Affiliate and business partner information
This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or as a business partner.
It allows us to recognise visitors that you have referred to us, and to credit to you commission due for such referrals. It also includes information that allows us to transfer commission to you.
The information is not used for any other purpose.
We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.
We expect any affiliate or partner to agree to reciprocate this policy.

They allow information gathered on one web page to be stored until it is needed for use on another, allowing a website to provide you with a personalised experience and the website owner with statistics about how you use the website so that it can be improved.
Some cookies may last for a defined period of time, such as one day or until you close your browser. Others last indefinitely.
For further information on how we use cookies, please refer to our cookie policy.
Cookie Policy
14.         Pixels
Pixels are graphics that are loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. Tracking pixels have similar functionalities as cookies. The tracks of the user are recorded by a file that is saved in the user’s hard drive. Pixels are used to gather useful information about your interactions with our websites or emails allowing us to provide you with a personalised experience and collect statistics about how you use the website so that it can be improved.
We use Pixels to track your interactions in relation to legitimate interest based on your activity on our websites.
15.          Marketing
We aim to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established a preference centre where you can view and make certain decisions about your personal data. You can access the centre via a link on every email that we send you or by logging in to your Bluebirds Account.
Third-party marketing
We work with Third Parties to enhance the user experience and ensure you are receiving interest based content from the club.
Social Media Marketing
Meta Custom Audiences
With your consent, we may display interest-based advertisements to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience tool.
A Custom Audience is made from a customer list provided by Cardiff City FC to Meta (the company that owns Facebook) and is created to connect with people who have already shown an interest in Cardiff City FC products or services. The customer list is made up of information - called “identifiers” – we’ve collected about our supporters (such as email, phone number and address). Prior to use, Meta
hashes
this information (a process which turns the information in the customer list into randomised code). For more information, on hashing please click
here
and for further information Custom Audiences, please click
here
. Facebook will not share the hashed data with third parties or other advertisers and will delete the hashed data promptly after the Custom Audience is created.
If you no longer wish to receive any such advertisements through Facebook, you can opt-out by choosing to remove any Cardiff City FC adverts from your Facebook feed.
Facebook Pixel
The Facebook pixel is a small piece of JavaScript code that an administrator of a Facebook ad account adds to their website in order to optimise their ads, report on conversions across devices and create Custom Audiences of website visitors to use in Facebook ads. The Facebook pixel was designed from the bottom up with privacy in mind. In order to use this product, the website does not need to collect or send names, email addresses or other contact information to Facebook.
Facebook will never share information from our website with third parties. All information used by Facebook is aggregated with millions of other signals before being read by Facebook’s optimisation systems. Facebook uses information obtained from websites that install pixels to improve its ads (as noted in our terms). This data is aggregated before it's used.
The Facebook pixel collects five types of data:
HTTP headers - Anything present in HTTP headers. HTTP headers are a standard web protocol sent between any browser request and any server on the Internet. HTTP headers include IP addresses, information about the web browser, page location, document, referrer and person using the website.
Pixel-specific data - This includes pixel ID and the cookie.
Button click data - This includes any buttons clicked by site visitors, the labels of those buttons and any pages visited as a result of the button clicks.
Optional values - Developers and marketers can optionally choose to send additional information about the visit through custom data events. Example custom data events are conversion value, page type and more.
Form Field Names - This includes website field names such as "email", "address" and "quantity" when a person purchases a product or service. The pixel does not capture field values unless an advertiser includes them as part of advanced matching or optional values.
16.      Our use of re-marketing
Re-marketing involves using cookies placed on your computer when you browse our website in order to be able to serve to you an advert for our products or services when you visit some other website or via other marketing channels when you leave the site.
We use third parties to provide us with re-marketing services which are detailed below. By accessing our websites and completing certain transactions online you have consented to our use of tracking and cookies to improve your online experience and receive important information regarding your interactions with us. You may see advertisements for our products and services on other websites and via other marketing channels as a result of this activity.
Disclosure and sharing of your information.
Fresh Relevance
Fresh Relevance stores information about your account, your orders, and products which interest you. It is used to manage your account and process your orders. Personal data may be used to send triggered emails, such as cart abandonment and purchase confirmation emails. Personal data may be used to personalise marketing, for example to suggest products that are related to your previous shopping. Fresh Relevance encrypts the entire processing of this data via their secure scripts to ensure your information remains secure.
If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications from us, you can opt out via the opt out link provided in the triggered email. This specific opt out will only opt you out of triggered cart abandonment emails and not all email communications from the club.

6.          Complaints regarding content on our website
If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate your complaint.
If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate.
If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.
7.          Information relating to your method of payment
At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of our Ticketing or Retail Partners. That page may be branded to look like a page on our website, but it is not controlled by us.
The security of your Credit Card data is of paramount importance to us.
Card payment is taken using Optomany managed service. As a member of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), Optomany is dedicated to ensuring merchants and customers alike are protected against card data fraud. Transaction authorisation, settlement and management with PAYware Ocius is delivered through a PCI DSS Level 1 certified payment processing infrastructure.
Optomany's solution includes tokenisation, which eliminates the need to store sensitive cardholder details by replacing the card details with a unique reference code.
Your credit card details are not held on our servers.
Please ensure that you are in agreement with the terms, conditions, Privacy and Cookie Policies on these payment websites before interacting with any such website or making any purchase.
8.          Information about your direct debit
When you agree to set up a direct debit arrangement, the information you give to us is passed to our own bank for processing according to our instructions. We do not keep a copy.
We are registered under the direct debit guarantee scheme. This provides for the customer's bank to refund disputed payments without question, pending further investigation. Direct debits can only be set up for payments to beneficiaries that are approved originators of direct debits. In order to be approved, these beneficiaries are subjected to careful vetting procedures. Once approved, they are required to give indemnity guarantees through their banks.
9.          Job application and employment
If you send us information in connection with a job application, we may keep it for up to six months in case we decide to contact you at a later date.
If we employ you, we collect information about you and your work from time to time throughout the period of your employment. This information will be used only for purposes directly relevant to your employment. Further detail is contained in our Staff Manual which is only available to employed staff.

11.      Complaining
When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us. We use that information to resolve your complaint.
We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.
12.      Affiliate and business partner information
This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or as a business partner.
It allows us to recognise visitors that you have referred to us, and to credit to you commission due for such referrals. It also includes information that allows us to transfer commission to you.
The information is not used for any other purpose.
We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.
We expect any affiliate or partner to agree to reciprocate this policy.
Use of information we collect through automated systems when you visit our website.
13.      Cookies

They allow information gathered on one web page to be stored until it is needed for use on another, allowing a website to provide you with a personalised experience and the website owner with statistics about how you use the website so that it can be improved.
Some cookies may last for a defined period of time, such as one day or until you close your browser. Others last indefinitely.
For further information on how we use cookies, please refer to our cookie policy.

14.         Pixels
Pixels are graphics that are loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. Tracking pixels have similar functionalities as cookies. The tracks of the user are recorded by a file that is saved in the user’s hard drive. Pixels are used to gather useful information about your interactions with our websites or emails allowing us to provide you with a personalised experience and collect statistics about how you use the website so that it can be improved.
We use Pixels to track your interactions in relation to legitimate interest based on your activity on our websites.

We aim to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established a preference centre where you can view and make certain decisions about your personal data. You can access the centre via a link on every email that we send you or by logging in to your Bluebirds Account.
Third-party marketing
We work with Third Parties to enhance the user experience and ensure you are receiving interest based content from the club.
Social Media Marketing
Meta Custom Audiences
With your consent, we may display interest-based advertisements to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience tool.
A Custom Audience is made from a customer list provided by Cardiff City FC to Meta (the company that owns Facebook) and is created to connect with people who have already shown an interest in Cardiff City FC products or services. The customer list is made up of information - called “identifiers” – we’ve collected about our supporters (such as email, phone number and address). Prior to use, Meta
hashes
this information (a process which turns the information in the customer list into randomised code). For more information, on hashing please click
here
and for further information Custom Audiences, please click
here
. Facebook will not share the hashed data with third parties or other advertisers and will delete the hashed data promptly after the Custom Audience is created.
If you no longer wish to receive any such advertisements through Facebook, you can opt-out by choosing to remove any Cardiff City FC adverts from your Facebook feed.
Facebook Pixel
The Facebook pixel is a small piece of JavaScript code that an administrator of a Facebook ad account adds to their website in order to optimise their ads, report on conversions across devices and create Custom Audiences of website visitors to use in Facebook ads. The Facebook pixel was designed from the bottom up with privacy in mind. In order to use this product, the website does not need to collect or send names, email addresses or other contact information to Facebook.
Facebook will never share information from our website with third parties. All information used by Facebook is aggregated with millions of other signals before being read by Facebook’s optimisation systems. Facebook uses information obtained from websites that install pixels to improve its ads (as noted in our terms). This data is aggregated before it's used.
The Facebook pixel collects five types of data:
HTTP headers - Anything present in HTTP headers. HTTP headers are a standard web protocol sent between any browser request and any server on the Internet. HTTP headers include IP addresses, information about the web browser, page location, document, referrer and person using the website.
Pixel-specific data - This includes pixel ID and the cookie.
Button click data - This includes any buttons clicked by site visitors, the labels of those buttons and any pages visited as a result of the button clicks.
Optional values - Developers and marketers can optionally choose to send additional information about the visit through custom data events. Example custom data events are conversion value, page type and more.
Form Field Names - This includes website field names such as "email", "address" and "quantity" when a person purchases a product or service. The pixel does not capture field values unless an advertiser includes them as part of advanced matching or optional values.
16.      Our use of re-marketing
Re-marketing involves using cookies placed on your computer when you browse our website in order to be able to serve to you an advert for our products or services when you visit some other website or via other marketing channels when you leave the site.
We use third parties to provide us with re-marketing services which are detailed below. By accessing our websites and completing certain transactions online you have consented to our use of tracking and cookies to improve your online experience and receive important information regarding your interactions with us. You may see advertisements for our products and services on other websites and via other marketing channels as a result of this activity.

Fresh Relevance
Fresh Relevance stores information about your account, your orders, and products which interest you. It is used to manage your account and process your orders. Personal data may be used to send triggered emails, such as cart abandonment and purchase confirmation emails. Personal data may be used to personalise marketing, for example to suggest products that are related to your previous shopping. Fresh Relevance encrypts the entire processing of this data via their secure scripts to ensure your information remains secure.
If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications from us, you can opt out via the opt out link provided in the triggered email. This specific opt out will only opt you out of triggered cart abandonment emails and not all email communications from the club.

Know your privacy rights
Know your privacy rights
Understand your privacy rights
Citizens in the United Kingdom and countries within the European Union have legal rights in respect of how personal data about them is collected, stored, used or otherwise acted on by businesses and organisations.
Net Lawman
has condensed the law into a short, easy to read guide about how the law protects your personal data. It aims to help you understand your rights and the legal obligations that business and organisations that process and control your data have to you.
Use of this guide to discharge obligations to notify you of your rights
One of the legal obligations of businesses and organisations that handle your personal data is to tell you about your legal rights.
This microsite provides a guide to your legal rights regarding the processing of your personal data. If you’ve been referred to it from another website, then the owner of the website that you were previously visiting is meeting their obligation to inform you of your rights under the accountability principle.
START
The Data Protection Act and the General Data Protection Regulation
The General Data Protection Regulation (known more commonly as the GDPR) came into force in May 2018 across all European Union Member States. Regulations binding acts that apply to all Member States without requiring a separate act of parliament to be passed in each.
Although it is a Regulation, the GDPR was written with the intention that it would be supplemented by additional law enacted by each Member State. The Data Protection Act is an act of parliament that further strengthens protection for individuals and gives data processors and controllers more extensive obligations. The same name has been used for entirely separate legislation in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.
Since 1 January 2021, post Brexit, the GDPR no longer applies in the UK. However, the Data Protection Act 2018 (the 'UK DPA') does. Since the UK DPA is UK law and not EU law, it continues to apply even though the UK is no longer a member of the European Union.
Scope of the law
The following pages of this microsite explain when data protection law applies.
What many people don’t realise is that the law applies to personal data processed offline, and not to just that collected and used through websites and apps. While we associate privacy notices with websites (‘website privacy policies’), the requirements to disclose your privacy policy and other information about data subjects’ rights apply even if you do not operate a website.
If you supply a privacy notice offline (for example, as a schedule to a contract) then you can still refer your data subjects to this microsite in order to discharge your obligations to inform them of their rights.
