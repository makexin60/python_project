Below is an explanation of who we may give your information to and for what purpose:
We may disclose to others in our group
We may give your information to any of our subsidiaries or our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, who support our processing of Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.
We may disclose to our service providers
We engage certain third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide a portion of the Services. Such third parties include, but are not limited to:
customer relationship management software providers, including Salesforce, headquartered in the US, which process your Personal Data globally, in order to assist us in providing the Services and contacting you;
internet hosting and cloud service provider services, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, headquartered in the US, which process certain Personal Data globally and enable us to offer a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) platform;
distributors, shipping, and logistics companies to fulfill orders and ensure delivery of packages;
customer support services and software providers, headquartered in the US and which process certain Personal Data globally, which allow us to deal with any service issues that Users may face and respond quickly to any questions about our Services;
business analytics and billing service providers, headquartered in the US and which process your Personal Data in the US, which allow us to provide the Services to you and better understand how the Services are used; and
software engineering service provider, headquartered in Vietnam, which allows us to efficiently build and maintain our platform.
Symphony is accountable for Personal Data that we receive and transfer to third parties (i.e., onward transfers). Accordingly, Symphony requires that these third-party services providers access and use Personal Data only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“
GDPR
”) and the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles, as applicable). Such performance can include the processing of Personal Data, provided that in the case of Symphony Services, no such third-party service provider has access to your unencrypted Posted Data.
Such third parties will be required to maintain the confidentiality of all Personal Data that they process on our behalf and to implement and maintain reasonable security controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such Personal Data. For Authorized Users, we will comply with the terms and conditions of the Service Agreement in effect between us and your Company (who is the Controller of your Personal Data) in connection with any such onward transfer of your Personal Data. Any such service provider to whom we transfer Personal Data for processing on behalf of us is also required to only employ staff who have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under a statutory obligation of confidentiality with respect to your Personal Data.
We will take reasonable steps to confirm that any such service provider processes such Personal Data in a manner that provides at least the same level of data protection as is provided for by this Privacy Policy and, for Authorized Users, as is required of us pursuant to the Service Agreement in place between us and your Company. Lastly, we will obligate any such third-party service provider to notify us if such provider becomes unable to satisfy such data protection obligations, and we will take reasonable steps to stop and remediate unauthorized or noncompliant processing by such service provider, upon becoming aware of such processing.
We may disclose to third parties to improve user experience
We may collect and share aggregated and de-identified information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes, and for third-party programs to access the Services in a manner that extends the user experience and helps us operate and improve the Services.
We may disclose to third parties if we sell our business
Information that we collect from our Users, including Personal Data, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your Personal Data, will be disclosed or transferred to a third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction. The disclosure and transfer of any of your Personal Data to such third-party acquirer will be done in compliance with applicable law and regulation (including but not limited to the GDPR and the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles, as the case may be), and only as necessary in order to enable us or the relevant acquiror to continue to perform services to you or your Company.
We may disclose to third parties where required by law, or in order to protect the rights, property, and safety of our company and our customers
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. In certain circumstances, we may disclose any of your Personal Data to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), law enforcement requests and national security requests; (ii) to protect the property, rights and safety of Symphony and its affiliates, our customers, and others; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. In the event of such disclosure or transfer of your Personal Data to public authorities, there is a chance that we will not be able to require such public authorities to implement and maintain reasonable security controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your Personal Data.
We may disclose to other Users
For Direct Users and Authorized Users of the Services, the information that is listed in your user profile, including, but not limited to, your profile photo, your Company and your name, will be published and viewable by other Users in our directory of Users so that other Users of our Services can connect with and contact you.
SECTION 5: OUR PROMOTIONAL UPDATES AND COMMUNICATIONS
Where permitted in our legitimate interest or with your prior consent where required by law, we may use your Personal Data for marketing analysis and to provide you with promotional update communications by email and social media platforms about our products/services. You can object to further marketing at any time by selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the end of all our marketing and promotional update communications to you, or by sending us an email at

.
SECTION 6: WHERE WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSERFERS
We are headquartered in the U.S. with offices and servers located in the U.S., among other places. We may store and process information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the location of our Users and service providers and the demands of local law. We will use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to try to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction.
When we transfer Personal Data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the UK, or Switzerland to other countries, we make sure that such Personal Data is sent with appropriate safeguards, including the following:
Data Privacy Framework
: Symphony complies with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (EU-US DPF), the UK Extension of the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-US DPF) as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. Symphony has certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-US DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-US DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. Symphony has certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-US DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-US DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-US DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-US DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
Model Clauses:
In addition, we may execute model contractual clauses applicable to the transfer of Personal Data. For transfers from the EEA, we may utilize the European Commission’s model clauses, also known as the Standard Contractual Clauses, to ensure an adequate level of protection for the transfer of Personal Data to third countries such as the U.S. For transfers from the UK, we may utilize the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement and/or Addendum.
Our data processing activities may be subject to the regulatory oversight of various applicable data protection authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate or process data. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Symphony’s compliance with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (EU-US DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-US DPF).
SECTION 7: YOUR RIGHTS
Users in EU, UK, Switzerland, and other Countries with equivalent laws
Data protection laws in a number of jurisdictions globally recognize data subjects have certain access rights to their data. If you are a User located in a country with such data subject access rights (e.g., a country within the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland), depending on whether you are a Visitor, a Direct User, or an Authorized User, we will offer you certain choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data.
Authorized Users:
If you are an Authorized User, the Personal Data associated with your Account is managed by your Company’s administrator. We can only act on the instructions of your Company, so you must contact them directly to exercise any rights over your Personal Data.

Supplemental Privacy Notice for California Residents
First Implemented:
January 1, 2020
Last Updated:
January 1, 2020
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“
CCPA
”), which is effective as of January 1, 2020, regulates how businesses handle “personal information” (as such term is defined in the CCPA) of California residents and gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a resident of California, we are required to inform you of how we use and disclose your personal information, as well as of certain rights you may have. This supplemental privacy notice (this “
Notice
”) is effective as of January 1, 2020, shall apply only to residents of California who are Direct Users and Visitors of our Services, and supplements Symphony’s general
Privacy Policy
. We will review this Notice at least annually and, to the extent we make any revisions, we will update this Notice and the “Last Updated” date above to indicate that changes were made. Any capitalized terms used in this Notice have the same meaning as in the Privacy Policy.
Symphony is both a “business” and a “service provider” under the CCPA, depending on which kind of User you are. This Notice applies only to personal information we collect in our role as a business. We act as a business when we collect and use personal information about Direct Users of the Symphony Services and Visitors of the Site.
If you are an Authorized User: (1) we act as a service provider to, and follow the instructions of, your Company (e.g., your employer) with respect to how we process your personal information; and (2) if you would like more information about how your personal information is processed or your rights under the CCPA, please contact your Company directly.
Collection and Disclosure of Personal Information
Over the past 12 months, we have collected and disclosed for business purposes* the following categories of personal information about Direct Users and Visitors (and, depending on whether you are Direct User or a Visitor, we may not have collected or disclosed any or all of this information):
Identifiers, such as your name, IP address, email alias, email address, mobile device identifier, zip code, and date of birth. This information is collected from you and/or your device when you access the Services or register for an Account, and it is collected to create your Account and to provide, improve, and personalize the Services.
Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as Cookies and Usage Data. This information is collected directly from you and your device to provide, improve, and personalize the Services.
Geolocation data derived from your IP address or obtained from your device’s location services (including GPS coordinates or coarse location). This information is collected directly from your device to improve and personalize our Services.
Visual information such as Direct Users’ profile pictures which are uploaded into the Symphony Services by you and are collected to provide the Services.
Professional or employment-related information such as your employer name, job title, and job description. This information is collected directly from you and is collected to provide, improve, and personalize the Services.
*We collect and disclose the above categories of personal information for “business purposes” as defined in the CCPA, which include providing our Services, maintaining and servicing accounts, providing customer service and support, detecting and protecting against security incidents and malicious or fraudulent activities, identifying and repairing errors within the Services, verifying and maintaining the quality of the Services, improving, upgrading, and enhancing the Services, and conducting research and development activities.    We may also disclose your information to comply with laws and protect the rights and safety of Symphony or third parties, as described in the
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others
section of the Privacy Policy.
Symphony does not, and during the past 12 months did not, “sell” personal information of California residents (as such term is defined in the CCPA).
Rights under the CCPA
If you are a Direct User or a Visitor who is a California resident, you have the right to:
Request we disclose to you, free of charge, the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:
the categories of personal information about you that we collected;
the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
the purpose for collecting personal information about you;
the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed personal information about you and the categories of personal information that was disclosed (if applicable) and the purpose for disclosing the personal information about you; and
the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you;
Request we delete personal information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception; and
Be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights including providing a different level or quality of services or deny goods or services to you when you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
How to Exercise Your Rights
If you are a Direct User or Visitor to whom the CCPA applies, you may contact us to exercise your rights at
legal@symphony.com
. Once we receive your request, we will review it, determine whether we can verify your identity, and process the request accordingly. If we need additional information to verify your identity or to respond to your request, we will let you know. We aim to fulfill all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA.  If necessary, extensions for an additional 45 days will be accompanied by an explanation for the delay.
Additionally, if you are a Direct User, you can access the following types of your personal information at any time by logging into your Account:
Name;
Email address;
Email alias;
Any personal information you have elected to include in your Profile Data;
Any other personal information contained in your Posted Data

Supplemental Privacy Notice for California Residents
First Implemented:
January 1, 2020
Last Updated:
January 1, 2020
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“
CCPA
”), which is effective as of January 1, 2020, regulates how businesses handle “personal information” (as such term is defined in the CCPA) of California residents and gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a resident of California, we are required to inform you of how we use and disclose your personal information, as well as of certain rights you may have. This supplemental privacy notice (this “
Notice
”) is effective as of January 1, 2020, shall apply only to residents of California who are Direct Users and Visitors of our Services, and supplements Symphony’s general
Privacy Policy
. We will review this Notice at least annually and, to the extent we make any revisions, we will update this Notice and the “Last Updated” date above to indicate that changes were made. Any capitalized terms used in this Notice have the same meaning as in the Privacy Policy.
Symphony is both a “business” and a “service provider” under the CCPA, depending on which kind of User you are. This Notice applies only to personal information we collect in our role as a business. We act as a business when we collect and use personal information about Direct Users of the Symphony Services and Visitors of the Site.
If you are an Authorized User: (1) we act as a service provider to, and follow the instructions of, your Company (e.g., your employer) with respect to how we process your personal information; and (2) if you would like more information about how your personal information is processed or your rights under the CCPA, please contact your Company directly.
Collection and Disclosure of Personal Information
Over the past 12 months, we have collected and disclosed for business purposes* the following categories of personal information about Direct Users and Visitors (and, depending on whether you are Direct User or a Visitor, we may not have collected or disclosed any or all of this information):
Identifiers, such as your name, IP address, email alias, email address, mobile device identifier, zip code, and date of birth. This information is collected from you and/or your device when you access the Services or register for an Account, and it is collected to create your Account and to provide, improve, and personalize the Services.
Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as Cookies and Usage Data. This information is collected directly from you and your device to provide, improve, and personalize the Services.
Geolocation data derived from your IP address or obtained from your device’s location services (including GPS coordinates or coarse location). This information is collected directly from your device to improve and personalize our Services.
Visual information such as Direct Users’ profile pictures which are uploaded into the Symphony Services by you and are collected to provide the Services.
Professional or employment-related information such as your employer name, job title, and job description. This information is collected directly from you and is collected to provide, improve, and personalize the Services.
*We collect and disclose the above categories of personal information for “business purposes” as defined in the CCPA, which include providing our Services, maintaining and servicing accounts, providing customer service and support, detecting and protecting against security incidents and malicious or fraudulent activities, identifying and repairing errors within the Services, verifying and maintaining the quality of the Services, improving, upgrading, and enhancing the Services, and conducting research and development activities.    We may also disclose your information to comply with laws and protect the rights and safety of Symphony or third parties, as described in the
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others
section of the Privacy Policy.
Symphony does not, and during the past 12 months did not, “sell” personal information of California residents (as such term is defined in the CCPA).
