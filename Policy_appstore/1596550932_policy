PRIVACY POLICY
‍
Last Updated: July 10th, 2024
This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of NGL Labs LLC (“NGL”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and how we handle personal information that we collect through our application, website and any other sites or services (collectively, the “Services”).
‍
The basics
‍
NGL allows users to receive messages through their social media. This is how it works:
The NGL app permits a user (“App User”) to generate an NGL link and then use the link to solicit messages from anyone with access to the link (the person sending a message is a “Message Sender”).
‍
When a Message Sender clicks on the NGL link, they will be taken to a URL where they can send a message directly to the App User. The App User also has the choice to post the messages and App User’s response to the App User’s social media accounts.
NGL does not store the name or social media handles of the Message Sender, and cannot reveal this information to the App User or to others. NGL may reveal properties of the Message Sender to the App User, based on the Message Sender’s IP address or browser user agent. Additionally, NGL may share this information with law enforcement for compliance, safety, and integrity issues.
To protect the safety of our users, we employ AI content moderation services like
Hive Moderation
. These services utilize deep learning and sophisticated algorithms to screen messages and filter out harmful language and bullying.
‍
