Effective date: March 10, 2019
Codable ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Codable mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").
This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.
Definitions
Service
Service is the Codable mobile application operated by Codable
Personal Data
Personal Data means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession).
Usage Data
Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).
Information Collection and Use
The service collects no identifiable information beyond that which is provided by the App Store Connect usage statistics. No data is sent or stored in third-party locations, other than App Store Connect.
When you access the Service through a mobile device, this information may be collected automatically, which includes the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and whether a session was initiated.
The service is used to load user-requsted URLs from the internet, but this data transaction is entirely constrained to within the client-side app service. User-entered data, or any data gathered from loaded websites is not retained or transmitted.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
The service may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy page periodically for any changes.
