PRIVACY POLICY
The LPGA's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.
The LPGA (hereafter referred     to as "LPGA" or "LPGA.com") does not collect personally identifiable     information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide     such information on a voluntary basis. For example, such personally identifiable     information may be gathered from a contest or sweepstakes registration, the     registration process for subscription sites or services and in connection with     content submissions, community postings (e.g., chat and message boards), suggestions,     voting/polling activities and transactional areas.
Personally identifiable information on individual users will not be sold or     otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of     the user at the time of collection. At such points of collection, the user will     have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out"     of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products,     services and offerings from the LPGA and/or any third parties.
LPGA.com is sharing personally identifiable information with Google Analytics (acting     as its site traffic gathering agent for this limited purpose) for the sole purpose     of gathering statistical data on visitors to the site and the pages viewed by     those visitors. If you wish to opt out,
visit Google Analytics' privacy center.
Further, notwithstanding any opt out of promotional information by the user,     the LPGA reserves the right to contact a subscriber regarding account status,     changes to the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying     service and/or the information collected.
The LPGA may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason     to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact     or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference     with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the LPGA's rights or property,     other LPGA users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. The     LPGA may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law     requires it.
The LPGA reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior     and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas     of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number     of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners.     The LPGA will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.     Also, users should be aware that the LPGA may sometimes permit third parties     to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through the LPGA's     site. The LPGA are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third     parties and users should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when     providing personally identifiable information.
Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally     identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards     or in the chat areas of the LPGA's sites, that information, along with any substantive     information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated     and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other     posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of the LPGA.
Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically     collected through the standard operation of the LPGA's internet servers or through     the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files a web site can     use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use     of the site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data     that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not     programs that come onto a user's system and damage files. Generally, cookies     work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the     assigning site. Users should be aware that the LPGA cannot or does not control     the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties     hosting data for the LPGA. If a user does not want information collected through     the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows     the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that     cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized     delivery of information) available on the LPGA's site.
Upon request, the LPGA will allow any user to "opt out" of further     promotional contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, the LPGA will use     reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously     submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will     not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request, the     LPGA will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user     and his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible     to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups     and records of deletions.
The foregoing policies are effective as of February, 2004. The LPGA reserves     the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence     of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies outlined herein     are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights     in or on behalf of any party.
By using this site, you signify your assent to the LPGA Privacy Policy. If     you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued     use of the LPGA's sites following the posting of changes to these terms will     mean you accept those changes.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Web site's privacy statement,
contact the LPGA.
