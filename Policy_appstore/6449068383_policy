                the information to a server in a third country. We cannot influence which
                personal data Google processes with your registration and the provision of
                downloads in the respective App store and App store software. The
                responsible

                access on
                your device via the Settings/Notifications/ options of your device; however,
                this means that our App may not function as intended.
e) Firebase
We use the Google
Firebase
developer
                App and related features and services
                provided by Google. We use the following Google Firebase services in our
                App: a)
                Firebase Analytics, and b) Firebase Crashlytics. By integrating Google
                services,
                Google may collect and process information (including personal data). It
                cannot
                be excluded that Google also transfers the information to a server in a
                third
                country. We cannot influence which data Google collects and processes.
                Firebase's key security and privacy information can be found here:
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
The legal basis is the
                implementation of the user contract for the use of the App.
f) Crashlytics
The app uses the tool Crashlytics to log crashes of our App. No personal
                data is
                transmitted. Only real-time crash reports with precise details of code
                locations
                and device information are sent, which is intended to simplify maintenance
                and
                improve the resulting stability of our App. The legal basis for data
                processing
                is our legitimate interest. In the settings under data services, you can
                select
                whether you want to send crash reports or not.
g) Google Analytics for Firebase
Our App uses the web analytics service Google Analytics for Firebase, which
                uses
                tracking technologies to track your use of our App. In this respect,
                information
                is generated about, among other things, the number of users and their
                sessions,
                the session duration, the operating system used by the users, their device
                model, the region from which our App is accessed, the first start of our
                App,
                our App execution and any updates.
In order to provide the relevant data for analysis, Firebase Analytics uses
                your
                a) device's advertising ID, b) an App instance ID (a randomly generated
                number
                that identifies a single app installation), c) and the IP address, which is
                shortened (IP masking) before being processed on Google's servers (which may
                be
                located outside the EEA) to generate the usage analysis. You can object to
                the
                use of Firebase Analytics at any time by disabling the sending of usage
                statistics in your device settings (Reset Advertising ID). We have no
                influence
                on these data processing operations. The basis for processing is our
                legitimate
                interest and your consent.
h) Google Admob
The app uses the Google Admob service to display ads. Ads are personalized
                based
                on the device you are using. You can disable this via the settings on your
                device. Google may use the advertising ID of your device, as well as cookies
                and/or similar technologies, to collect personal data for the purpose of
                generating and displaying personalized advertising. More detailed
                information
                about what data Google collects and how it is processed can be found here.
In accordance with Google's own Guidance: To improve the performance of
                AdMob,
                the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect certain information from apps,
                including:
IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and
                    improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising
                    and
                    analytics purposes.
User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or
                    energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand
                    the
                    effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features.
                    Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing
                    with
                    other entities that display ads.
A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other
                    app-bounded
                    device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party
                    advertising and analytics.
Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used
                    to
                    power analytics and advertising features.
Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction
                    information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising
                    performance.
i) Advertising
Advertisers and third parties also may collect information about your
                activity
                on our app, on devices associated with you, and on third-party sites and
                applications using tracking technologies. Tracking data collected by these
                advertisers and third parties is used to decide which ads you see both on
                our
                app and on third-party sites and applications. If you do not wish to
                participate

                for processing is our legitimate interest.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
a) What we do not do
We do not request Personal Data from minors and children;
​We do not process special category data without obtaining prior
                    specific
                    consent;
​We do not use Automated decision-making including profiling; and
​We do not sell your Personal Data.
b) Sharing
We will not disclose or otherwise distribute your Personal Data to third
                parties unless this is a) necessary for the performance of our services, b)
                you
                have consented to the disclosure, c) or the disclosure of data is permitted
                by
                relevant legal provisions. In addition, we may disclose your Personal Data:
                in
                connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention or other legal
                proceedings; as
                required by law or regulation; if Food Simp (or a part of Food Simp) is sold
                to
                or merged with another company; or if we have reason to believe that
                disclosure
                is necessary to protect our business.
c) International Transfer
We may transfer your Personal Data to other companies as necessary for the
                purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In order to provide adequate
                protection for your Personal Data when it is transferred, we have
                contractual
                arrangements regarding such transfers. We take all reasonable technical and
                organizational measures to protect the Personal Data we transfer.
d) Storage
In the course of our business and App operations, we process data in our
                Ireland based headquarters. All data collected is generally transferred to
                our
                Amazon Web Services (AWS) Server and a MySQL Database. The legal basis for
                the
                data processing is our legitimate interest in providing our App.
e) Data Security
Our App uses SSL or TLS encryption to ensure the security of data
                processing
                and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as login data
                or
                contact requests that you send to us. We have also implemented numerous
                security
                measures (“technical and organizational measures”) for example encryption or
                need to know access, to ensure the most complete protection of Personal Data
                processed through our App.
Nonetheless, databases or data sets that include Personal Data may be
                breached
                inadvertently or through wrongful intrusion. Upon becoming aware of a data
                breach, we will notify all affected individuals whose Personal Data may have
                been compromised, and the notice will be accompanied by a description of the
                action being taken to reconcile any damage as a result of the data breach.
                Notices will be provided as expeditiously as possible after which the breach
                was
                discovered.

                respond
                to your request within thirty (30) days after receiving your request, we
                will
                inform you in writing within thirty (30) days of the time by which we will
                be
                able to respond to your request. If we are unable to provide you with any
                Personal Data or to make a correction requested by you, we shall generally
                inform you of the reasons why we are unable to do so (except where we are
                not
                required to do so under the respective legal regulations mentioned above).
a) What we do not do
We do not request Personal Data from minors and children;
​We do not process special category data without obtaining prior
                    specific
                    consent;
​We do not use Automated decision-making including profiling; and
​We do not sell your Personal Data.
f) Complaint to a supervisory authority
You have the right to complain about our processing of Personal Data to a
                supervisory authority responsible for data protection. However, we would
                appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you contact any
                supervisory authority.
USA SPECIFIC PROVISIONS
The following applies to all users located in the United States. While we
                understand and appreciate that privacy and consumer data protection laws
                differ
                as they are subject to each state's legislature and that no data protection
                framework similar to the DPA or GDPR exists on a federal level, we are
                committed
                to follow and apply the for your state relevant privacy rules and
                regulations.
                As of the day of drafting, the following states had enacted privacy and
                consumer
                data protection laws:
​California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) including its subsequent
                    amendments from the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act
                    (“CPRA”);
Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”);
Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”);
Delaware Online Privacy Protection Act (“DOPPA”);
Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act (“ICDPA”);
Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (“ICDPA”);
​Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (“MCDPA”);
Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (“OCPA”);
Tennessee Information Protection Act (“TIPA”);
Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (“TDPSA”);
Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”); and
Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”).
Further and under consideration of the similarities of the above
                provisions, no
                conflict should arise pursuing a uniform approach in granting all users in
                the
                USA the same rights and privileges as set out above. However, should
                ambiguity
                occur the most stringent provision is chosen to ensure the most
                comprehensive
                approach when it comes to protecting your Personal Data.
Further, the following also apply:
i) “Shine the Light”
“Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section 1798.83) requires us to respond
                to
                requests from California asking about the business’s practices related to
                disclosing Personal Data to third parties for the third parties’ direct
                marketing purposes. You may make a request about our collection and
                disclosure
                of your Personal Data using the contact details provided.
ii) COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of Personal Data from children under the
                age of
                13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
                parents
                in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection
                agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites
                and
                online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online. We
                do
                not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
iii) CAN SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
                establishes
                requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have
                emails
                stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for
                violations.
                To be in accordance with CAN SPAM, we agree to the following: If at any time
                you
                would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us,
                and we
                will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
iv) Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)
If we process your Personal Data for the purpose of sending you SMS
                marketing
                communications, you may manage your receipt of marketing and
                non-transactional
                communications from us by replying or texting ‘STOP’ if you receive our SMS
                communications. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely
                on
                the basis of our consent in personalized direct advertising per SMS.
v) Controls For Do-Not-Track Features
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
                include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal
                your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
                activities
                monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, our
                website does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                mechanism
                that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
                standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
                we
                will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this policy.
vi) Right to complain
Finally, and in regard to the right to complain to a supervisory authority.
                You
                have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of Personal Data
                with a
                supervisory authority responsible for data protection. Users based in the
                above
                mentioned States may lodge a complaint with the relevant district attorney
                or
                attorney general office. However, we would appreciate the opportunity to
                address
                your concerns before you contact any supervisory authority.
VALIDITY AND QUESTIONS
This Privacy Policy was last updated on Monday, 29th of April 2024, and is
                the
                current and valid version. However, from time to time changes or a revision
                to
                this policy may be necessary.
If you feel that the above is not sufficient or if you have any queries as
                regards the collection, processing or use of your information we are looking
                forward to hearing from you. We will make every effort to reply as soon as
                possible and take into consideration any suggestions from your end.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
