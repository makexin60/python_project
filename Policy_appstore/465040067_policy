Privacy Policy
Outdoria Pty Ltd ABN 77 605 113 835 (within Australia) and Outdoria Pty Ltd NZBN 9429047253711 (within New Zealand) ("CamperMate", "we", "us", "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our Website and App.
The processing of Personal Data shall always be in line with the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs") contained in the Privacy Act 1988 ("Privacy Act"), the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and in accordance with country-specific data protection regulations applicable to CamperMate.
We have implemented a number of technical and organisational measures to ensure the most complete protection of Personal Data processed through the Service.
For the purpose of the GDPR in respect of the Personal Data of the Website and the App, the Data Controller is CamperMate. In respect of Personal Data that is provided to Subscribers, we act as a data processor or joint data controller (as appropriate).
When working as a data processor CamperMate will be acting on the instructions of its Subscribers and will work hard to ensure that the Subscriber is fully GDPR compliant. You will need to review the privacy policy of that Subscriber as in this instance they will be the data controller, and we will only process Personal Data on behalf of our Subscribers in accordance with their instructions and not for our own purposes. Similarly, where we act as a data processor CamperMate has no direct control over the data collected by its Subscribers. This means that you should contact the Subscriber with any data controller requests. Where we act as a joint data controller then we will share responsibilities with the Subscriber.
Definitions
Capitalised terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms and Conditions, unless otherwise inconsistent with the context. In addition, the following capitalised terms have the following meanings:
a)"Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
b)"Personal Data" means any information that allows someone to identify you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.
c)"Sensitive Data" means Personal Information relating to a person's physical or mental health, race or religion.
User Consent
Where we rely on your consent as the lawful basis to process your data we will always ask for you to positively affirm your acceptance. By clicking "I accept the Privacy Policy" or similar, or if we indicate that by clicking a button you are accepting this Privacy Policy you acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
We note that certain contact or other data forms where consent is required to be given by you include no pre-checked checkboxes so that you are able to freely and affirmatively opt-in.
In cases where we do not consider it practical to include a checkbox, we will indicate that by clicking a certain button you have agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide you with notice on the App specifically detailing what it is that you are consenting to in clear and plain language as well ensuring that each matter that requires consent is clearly distinguishable.
For all areas of the App where consent is given it is just as easily able to be withdrawn through the appropriate account settings on the App.
If you believe that consent has not been given freely or in breach of the terms of this Privacy Policy please contact us.
Children
Our App is not offered to persons who cannot form legally binding contracts under Applicable Law (except where parental/guardian consent is given). We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from such visitors.You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your Personal Data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to consent on your behalf).

Storage & Security of Your Personal Data
The CamperMate Service is hosted through Amazon Web Services (AWS) whose servers are located in Australia. All data is stored in databases which are not publicly accessible and are not on a public network in AWS.
CamperMate is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We take all reasonable steps to protect Personal Data, including through internal and external security, restricting access to Personal Data to those who have a need to know, maintaining technological products to prevent unauthorised computer access and regularly reviewing our technology to maintain security. We choose technology partners based on their security and privacy policies and practices.
Personal Data stored in our system is protected by electronic and procedural safeguards. We take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data (and other content) from accidental loss and theft by storing it in secure data centres with off-site backups. Communication between Users and our servers is encrypted via industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL).
The App is protected by a secure and encrypted password that each Account holder must choose themselves. Account holders should never share their passwords. CamperMate is not responsible for any loss of data or breach of privacy if an Account holder shares their password with someone else. We do not store your password on our servers.
Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorised people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, therefore, while CamperMate uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, CamperMate cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Personal Data is generally not disclosed outside of Australia except to data hosting and other IT service providers (where incidental to data transfer between endpoints). We take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipients of your Personal Data do not breach the privacy obligations relating to your Personal Data.
Third parties located overseas are not permitted to (and are contractually obligated to not) access or use the Personal Data provided except for those limited purposes. We only choose reputable service providers and have agreements with such third parties that prevent them from using or disclosing to others the Personal Data we share with them, other than as is necessary to assist us. We may disclose your Personal Data to entities who may store or process your data overseas.
Notifiable Data Breaches
We take data breaches very seriously. Depending on where you reside our policy is:
1. If you reside in Australia:
In the event that there is a data breach and we are required to comply with the notification of eligible data breaches provisions in Part IIIC of the
Privacy Act 1988
(Cth) or any other subsequent sections or legislation which supersede this Part IIIC, we will take all reasonable steps to contain the suspected or known breach where possible and follow our notifiable data breach policies.
2. If you reside in the European Union of EFTA States:
We will endeavour to meet the 72 hour deadline as imposed by the GDPR, to report any data breach to the supervisory authority where a data breach occurs that will likely be a risk to you.
Further, where there is likely to be a high risk to your rights we will endeavour to contact you without undue delay.
We will review every incident and take action to prevent future breaches.
Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
If you reside in the European Union or EFTA States, you shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you, or similarly significantly affects you, as long as the decision is not necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between us, or is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which we are subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or is not based on your explicit consent. If you wish to exercise your rights please contact us.
Retention of Data
We keep Personal Data from active accounts as long as it is reasonably needed for our operations and to fulfill the purposes set out herein.
We take steps to regularly destroy Personal Data, however we may:
a) in some cases, retain a copy of your Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and to comply with our trust and safety obligations. Personal Data retained for this purposes will be archived and stored in a secure manner after your Account has been closed, and will not be accessed unless required for any of these reasons; and
b)retain Personal Data in an aggregated, de-identified or otherwise anonymous form, such that there is no reliable way of identifying you from the information.

App Privacy Policy
We at Outdoria Pty Ltd trading as
CamperMate.com
("Outdoria," "CamperMate," "we," "us," or "our") know that our users ("you," "your," or "yourself") care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.
Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
By visiting or using the
campermate.com
website and domain name, features, content, mobile applications, and any other services we offer from time to time in connection with any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Website"), you agree to the practices and policies set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby acknowledge and consent to our collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy extends to the apps developed by Outdoria and CamperMate via GeoZone, including (but not limited to) "CamperMate", "Australian Visitor Centres", "THL Roadtrip" and "Family Parks -- Holiday Parks".
Any external links to other websites are clearly identifiable as such, and we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these other websites. Capitalised terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use.
I. What does this 'Privacy Policy' cover?
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage, even if you have accessed the websites or services of those companies through our Website.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services (as that term is defined in our Terms of Use). If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18 may provide any personal information to us or on the Services. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at
info@campermate.com.au
.
II. What information does CamperMate collect?
We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to, among other things, personalise and improve our services, allow our users to set up a user account and profile, contact users, fulfil your requests for certain products and services, analyse how users utilise the Website, or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (as described in this Section and in Section III below). We collect the following types of information:
A. Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, username, phone number, credit card and other billing information, email address, shipping address, and your third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook). We may also collect information you supply to us regarding your personal preferences and interests.
If you access the Service through an external third-party application, such as Facebook, we may receive some data from those connected third-party applications. Connecting your account to third-party applications or services is optional, and when you connect your account to an external app, you will be given the opportunity to grant permission. You can revoke your permission under your account settings.
We may receive or collect information (for example, an email address) about a person who is not yet a registered CamperMate member (a "non-member") in connection with certain CamperMate features, including but not limited to: a non-member subscribing to a CamperMate newsletter, a member inviting a non-member to visit the Site, a non-member engaging in a transaction, or a member sending a gift card code to a non-member. Non-member information is used only for the purpose it was originally submitted to us. A non-member can contact CamperMate support if they do not want us to retain their information.
We may anonymise your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified and provide that anonymised information to our partners. For example, we allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to allow our advertisers to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. We might use the fact you have purchased or inquired about a certain brand of apparel, for instance, to show you advertisements for the company that sells that brand, but we will not disclose to that company your identity.
B. Information Collected Automatically:
Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, "cookie" information, and the page you requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer or device that allow us to recognise your browser or device and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your computer's or device's acceptance of cookies, but doing so may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website's best features. Our advertising partners may transmit cookies to your computer or device when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover cookies delivered to you by any of our advertisers.
When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website and to which pages within the Website), we only use such data in aggregate form, in a manner that assures your anonymity. We may provide this aggregate usage information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Website, so that our partners, too, can endeavour to provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, we may place a cookie on your device that records what products you have viewed on our Website, and then provide that information, in non-personally-identifiable form, to a third party website, to allow such website to show you ads for similar products that are available from us or from third parties.
We may also deliver a file to you through the Website (known as a "web beacon") from an advertising network we have contracted with. Web beacons allow advertising networks to provide anonymised, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. These beacons may, for example, log that you have viewed a certain product on our Website, and then show you an ad for similar products when you browse to another website. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Many ad networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards, and such NAI members may allow you to opt-out of cookies or beacons they deliver. Again, we do not control the policies of any third parties, including advertising networks.
We do not honour do-not-track signals from Internet browsers or other consumer choice mechanisms regarding the collection of behavioural tracking data.
C. Location Data:
If you have enabled location services for an app or website delivered by Outdoria and CamperMate via GeoZone, including (but not limited to) "CamperMate", "Let's Go Australia", "Reflections Holiday Parks", "Happy Campers NZ", "Wilderness NZ", "thl Roadtrip" and "Family Parks -- Holiday Parks", we may collect your precise location information based on latitude and longitude. We may also derive your approximate location from the IP address of your computer or mobile device. Geolocation data is used for purposes of providing you with relevant content and services such as deals, articles and road warnings. Our location data is anonymised and is used to help us improve the user experience on our app.
D. E-mail and Other Communications:
We may contact you, by email or other means. For example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of the Website. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by changing your account settings accordingly.
III. Will CamperMate share any of the personal information it receives?
We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third parties only as described below:
A. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognise when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that we deem it related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit information from your CamperMate account to an account on a third party website or service, such as Facebook. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business's or websites' policies.
B. Agents:
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we inform you otherwise, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what we deem necessary to assist us in performing such tasks.
C. Other CamperMate Users:
As part of the buying and selling process, we will facilitate the sharing of information between the two members involved in the transaction. As part of the buying or selling process, you may obtain another CamperMate user's email address, shipping address, payment information, and/or other information. As described in CamperMate's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information only for CamperMate-related communications or for CamperMate-facilitated transactions. We have not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorised transactions. Without express consent from that person, you must not add any CamperMate user to your email or physical mailing list or store or misuse any payment information.
D. User Profiles and Content:
Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user's username and the image content that such user has uploaded to the website may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website or address your request for our services. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your username may also be displayed to other users if and when you post comments or upload images through the Website and other users can contact you through such comments. If you sign into the Services through Facebook Connect, your list of "friends" from Facebook may be automatically imported to the Services, and such "friends," if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.
E. Business Transfers:
We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information (which may include your Personal Information) is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
F. Protection of CamperMate and Others:
We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with laws; enforce or apply our conditions of use and/or other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of CamperMate, our employees, our users, or others. We may exchange information with other companies and organisations (including governmental authorities) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
G. With Your Consent:
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
IV. Is personal information about me secure?
Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via Facebook Connect, you may have additional or different sign-on protections through Facebook. You need to prevent unauthorised access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password (or other sign-on protections) appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
We endeavour to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.
The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site's privacy policy.
V. What personal information can I Access?
Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you've provided to us:
name and password
email address
shipping and billing information
user profile information and User Content, including images you have uploaded to the site
The information you can view and update may change as the Website changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at
info@campermate.com.au
VI. What data CamperMate retain?
We will retain your information only for as long as is necessary or your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide you services, you may close your account. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
You may inform us of any changes or requests in regards to your personal data, and in accordance with our obligations under local data protection law, we may update or delete your personal data accordingly.
VII. What choices do I have?
You can always elect not to disclose information to us. However, please keep in mind that we may need some information to allow you to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of our features, and if you choose not to provide that information, your ability to use our Website and services may be limited.
You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained in Section V above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by visiting your account settings. Please note that some information may remain in our private records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information even if you update or delete it, but we will not use that information in a manner that would identify you personally.
If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please change your account settings accordingly. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.
VIII. Changes to this 'Privacy Policy'
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website or contacting you directly via email or other means. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted.
IX. Questions or concerns
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to
info@campermate.com.au
. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
