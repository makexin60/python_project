Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you use the Garmin Explore™ website, create an account, activate and use your inReach® device, utilize inReach® satellite subscription services, and/or use a compatible app, such as the Earthmate™,  Garmin Explore™, Garmin Messenger™ or Alpha Hunt apps.
What personal data does Garmin collect?
While exploring the outdoors with Garmin, you might save your favorite routes and waypoints, send messages or your location to friends and family, or — in the case of an unforeseen issue — communicate with Garmin Response℠ and emergency service personnel. We ask for personal data — such as your name, email address, location, and other information — so you can sign in to your account, receive personalized support, receive important safety information about your devices and services, and get the most out of our products.

When You Make a Garmin Account
Garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in. It also helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
When You Get an inReach Subscription
inReach® service plans provide off-grid communication, interactive SOS, tracking and more via the Iridium® satellite network. Due to the comprehensive nature of inReach® service plans, additional information is required to be collected. For example, we process your phone number and email address so we can communicate with you as necessary and relay your billing information.
When You Use inReach Services
Our inReach® products and satellite communication services enable you to send an interactive SOS alert in an emergency. To appropriately respond to an SOS activation, we may need to use the location of your inReach® device, emergency information from your account, and text, SMS, and email messages sent to and from your inReach® device.
When You Sync Devices
When you sync devices, data such as your IP address, sync time and date, and battery level will be uploaded to Garmin.
When You Upload Activities From the Garmin Explore App
If you choose to upload recorded activities or tracked routes from the Garmin Explore™ or Earthmate® app to your Garmin account, we collect data from those activities so you can view and analyze it. You can even share it with others — but you don’t have to. You can withdraw your consent and delete activities or tracked routes at any time.
When You Contact Garmin
We know you might want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact, device, or subscription information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.

Why does Garmin ask for your personal data?

To Keep You Informed

When you visit our sites or use our apps, we collect information — such as your IP address, location, times that you visit, and more — to let us know how people navigate our sites and apps and how we can improve them.
To Give You Information You Might Actually Find Interesting
We use things such as cookies, pixel tags, and similar tools to help us provide better, more relevant content on our sites.

Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:
When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish. We may also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We process your email address and password because you use your email address and password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address and password for this purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you enable two-factor authentication, we process your mobile phone number or email address to send the security code via SMS or email. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you reside in mainland China, we process your mobile phone number for purposes of real name authentication.
(b) We also process your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on our websites or apps or engage with other users. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is our legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other users.
(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receive direct marketing information from us, we will also process your email address or other account identifiers for the purpose of sending you marketing communications (e.g., emails, push notifications) about our products, services, and apps, as well as newsletters. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your
preferences
in your account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from us are based on the preferences you provide in your account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your  account, and any subscriptions included in your account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is our legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails. If you reside in mainland China, we may use your mobile phone number to send you marketing communications via SMS.
(d) We also process your email address to associate it with your account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.
(e) We also process your email address to notify customers when they have violated our terms. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in ensuring a quality experience for all customers and ensuring adherence to our terms.
Personal data that is processed when you purchase a product, service, or subscription:
When you purchase a product, service, or subscription, we collect your name, email address, mailing address, billing address, and telephone number. We do not view or store your payment card information, which is handled by third-party service providers. When you purchase a subscription through your app store provider (e.g., Apple, Google), they will collect certain personal data, such as your name, email address, and payment information. Garmin will receive personal data such as your name and email address, but we do not view or store your payment card information, which is handled by the applicable app store provider.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We collect your name, mailing address, and telephone number so we can process your order and fulfill your purchase. The legal ground for processing your name, mailing address, and telephone number for these purposes is performance of a contract. We also process your personal data as part of our fraud detection processes, which may include the use of personal data related to the purchase, delivery, or use of products, services, or subscriptions as needed to investigate requests or claims. The legal ground for processing your personal data for that purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting us and our customers from attempts to engage in fraudulent transactions.
Personal data that is processed when you use our communication services:
When you use our communication services, we process your mailing address, telephone number, contact information for your chosen contacts, text, SMS, and email messages sent to and from one of our devices or apps, the content of your messages, and other related information such as the time of the message, delivery status, and the location of your device.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We process this information to perform our communication services. The legal ground for this processing is performance of a contract.
(b) We process location information received from your device to help facilitate search and rescue operations in the event of an emergency. To enable us to do this, your device automatically submits location data to our servers periodically, typically once every hour. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing services in the event of an emergency.
Personal data that is processed when you sync your Garmin device:
When you sync your device directly or through a compatible Garmin app, we log data about the transmission, such as the IP address used when syncing, the sync time and date, crash/diagnostic logs, geographic location of the device, information about your device, information about the network used to sync (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular), and device battery level.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process this information to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is our legitimate interest in resolving errors or syncing issues and providing quality product support. We also process this information to analyze usage and trends and develop or improve features and services. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing relevant and quality features and services.
Personal data that is processed when you use location-based subscription services or choose to upload your location-based data through Garmin apps:
If you subscribe to a service that uses location-based data (e.g., services that enable you to remotely track the location of a device or to request assistance to your location), we collect location-based data from your device when it is activated and connected to the service.  You can also choose to upload your location-based data, such as waypoints, routes, courses, tracks, activities (e.g., runs, hikes, hunts, off-roading routes, etc.), and activity data from your device to your account via compatible Garmin apps, such as the Garmin Explore™ app. Activity data may include data such as location, timestamp, tracks, elevation, speed, and distance. If you choose to upload your location-based data to an applicable app or the Garmin Explore™ website, you may control whether your location-based data is shared with other users via MapShare™, LiveTrack, social media, or other means by adjusting your privacy settings.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) If you use a location-based subscription service, we process this information to perform the requested service. The legal ground for this processing is performance of a contract.
(b) We also process your location-based data, if you choose to upload it to your account through a compatible Garmin app, to enable you to analyze your data, see your location on your activity or course, see metrics, and, if you wish, share your data with others. The legal ground for this processing is your consent. You can withdraw your consent by changing your account settings.
(c) We also process this data, if you choose to upload or add it to your account, in an aggregated manner to analyze usage and trends and develop or improve features and services. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing relevant, quality features and service.
Personal data that is processed when you communicate with Garmin:
When you interact with our customer support representatives by email or telephone, online, or in person, we collect personal data, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences, and information about the products you own, such as their serial numbers and dates of purchase, and subscriptions you've purchased. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues and capture information relating to the support or service issue. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys. With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process this information to provide you with customer and product support, to monitor the quality and types of customer and product support we provide to our customers, and to facilitate repairs, returns, or exchanges. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is our legitimate interest in providing quality product support. The legal ground for signing in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue is your consent, which you may withdraw.
Personal data that is processed when you connect your Garmin account to a third-party app if you choose:
If you choose to enable your Garmin account to access accounts you have with other app providers, we will obtain information about you from the linked accounts, such as username or profile picture.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
This information is provided to us by those services to allow us to post content on your behalf when you request to do so. The legal ground for this processing is your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disconnecting your account from the third-party app within your account.
Personal data that is processed to address fraud and abuse:
We take steps to identify, detect, and mitigate fraud and abuse on our services, websites, and apps. If we suspect a fraudulent request or claim has been made relating to your account or device, we may process data relating to the device(s) associated with your account, basic account information such as email address, name, phone number(s), and mailing address(es), or our communication history with you in order to adequately investigate the request or claim. We may process content that you have contributed to your account, such as activities, photos, comments, and reviews, to develop and test measures to help identify, detect, and mitigate disruption and damage to our services, websites, and apps potentially caused by or related to such content, to enforce our terms of use, to identify and remove inappropriate, harmful, or abusive content, and for related purposes.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
We perform these processing activities to protect the interests of Garmin, its customers, and other stakeholders against fraud, breach of contract, and other harmful or unlawful actions.  The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in reducing fraud and abuse perpetuated through the use of, or in connection with, our products and services.
Personal data that is processed when you choose to upload or add your data to your Garmin account:
Our applications may enable you to upload or sync data (e.g., data collected by device sensors) to your account or allow you to add data through your use of the application.
