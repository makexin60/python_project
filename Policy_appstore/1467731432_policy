Protecting your stored information
While we store it, your information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards (which may include encryption and other forms of security) and governed by the laws of Australia and the Australian Privacy Principles.
Our third party service providers that receive your information are also required to comply with strict measures to protect your information and to apply appropriate measures for the use and transfer of information.
Information collected may be retained and used by us for a reasonable period in accordance with our data retention policy. For example, we normally keep your main banking information for a period of seven years from when our relationship with you ends. This allows us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements or use it where we need to for our legitimate purposes such as managing your account and dealing with any disputes or concerns that may arise. We may need to keep your information for longer where we need the information to comply with regulatory or legal requirements, help detect or prevent fraud and financial crime, answer requests from regulators etc. If we don't need to keep information for this length of time, we may destroy, delete or anonymise it sooner.
If you provide information about others
If you provide information to us about another person (such as a joint account holder, trustee, beneficiary or guarantor) you must make sure they know you have done this, and agree to us processing their informationÂ as set out in this Privacy Policy. You also need to tell them how to find a copy of this Privacy Policy.
C. Information sharing
We share your information with

any bodies or partnerships between law enforcement and the financial sector or authorities, such as legal, regulatory, law enforcement, government and tax authorities in Australia or overseas or anyone acting for them
any person who you hold a joint account with, people who can give instructions for you and anyone who may give security for your loans
any third party who we may transfer our business or assets to
partners and providers of reward, co-branding or loyalty programs, charities or non-profit organisations
social media advertising partners (who can check if you hold an account with them for advertising purposes and the partner may then use your information to send our adverts to you and advertise to people who have a similar profile to you).
We may share your anonymised information with other parties not listed above. If we do this you won't be identifiable from this information.
Storing your information overseas
We may transfer and store your information overseas (see section D). Where those countries don't have the same level of protection for personal information, we'll take reasonable steps to ensure overseas recipients provide the same level of protection.
Direct marketing
This is when we use your personal information to send you details about products, services and offers such as financial, insurance or related products and services provided by us or our co-branding partners, rewards, loyalty privileges or charities. We'll only do this if you've consented (including by your indication of no objection to us).
We may use your contact details and information such as your demographic information, products and services that you are interested in, transaction behaviour, portfolio information, location information, social media information, analytics and formation from third parties when we market to you.
You can tell us anytime if you don't want to receive marketing from us by clicking the "unsubscribe" links in our emails, contacting us (it may take a short time to update our records to reflect any change), or updating your preferences on social media platforms.
We'll need to get your separate consent to share your information with others for them to market their products and services to you.
