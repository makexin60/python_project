This notice applies to Washington residents and those whose consumer health data is collected in Washington. Consumer health data means personal information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a consumer and that identifies the consumer's past, present, or future physical or mental health status, under the Washington State My Health My Data Act (MHMDA).  See also our other privacy notices that provide disclosures about personal information that is not consumer health data subject to MHMDA.
This notice does not apply where an exception or exemption applies such as with respect to protected health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and data that is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”).  When we are a covered entity, we provide separate HIPAA and GLBA privacy notices to certain customers and consumers as required under applicable laws and regulations.  Most consumer health data we process is regulated under HIPAA or GLBA or is processed for a necessary function.
Consumer Health Data Collected
The personal information, including consumer health data, we collect varies based on your relationship with us. For example, if you visit our website we may collect personal information through tracking technologies essential to running our website.  Or, if you visit our physical premises in Washington, we may collect video surveillance or other information that could incidentally include consumer health data.
We may collect the following categories of consumer health data:
Individual health conditions, treatment, diseases, or diagnosis;
Social, psychological, behavioral, and medical interventions;
Health-related surgeries or procedures;
Use or purchase of prescribed medication;
Bodily functions, vital signs, symptoms, or measurements of other types of consumer health data;
Diagnoses or diagnostic testing, treatment, or medication;
Gender-affirming care information;
Reproductive or sexual health information;
Biometric data;
Genetic data;
Precise location information that could reasonably indicate a consumer's attempt to acquire or receive health services or supplies;
Data that identifies a consumer seeking health care services; and
Other information that may be processed to derive or infer data related to the above or other consumer health data.
The categories of consumer health data above may include the following personal information, when collected in connection with your past, present, or future physical or mental health status:
Identifiers
such as name, contact information, online identifiers, and government-issued ID numbers;
Characteristics of Protected Classifications
under state or federal law such as age and medical conditions;
Commercial Information
such as transaction information and purchase history;
Internet or Network Activity Information
such as browsing history, interactions with our website, Internet Protocol (IP) address, Media Access Control (MAC) address; operating system and version; Internet browser type and version;
Geolocation Data
such as device location; and
