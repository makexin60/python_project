Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy explains the privacy rules applicable to all information collected or submitted  when you access, install, or use Free VPN Unlimited Services. This Privacy Policy will remain in  effect until a new policy supersedes it.
Your continued use of the Website and our services will constitute your acknowledgment of  the policy in its current version and your understanding of the terms of the policy. If you  disagree with the rules of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.
Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required  to operate a world-class VPN service at scale. We designed our systems to not have  sensitive data about our customers; We do not ever sell your personal information  to third parties. We do not collect logs of your activity (browsing history, traffic  destination, data content, or DNS queries). We also never store connection logs,  meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection  timestamp, or session duration.
This privacy policy will help you understand how we collect, use and store information.

Connection Status and Usage Statistics
The section below specifies in detail what information we collect. We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content or DNS queries. Therefore:
We do not know who accessed a particular website or service.
We do not know who was connected to the VPN
Connection Status
Should anyone try to compel Free VPN Unlimited to release user information based on any  of the above, we cannot supply this information because the data doesn't exist.
In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, Free VPN Unlimited collects the following information related to your VPN usage:
We collect information about whether you have successfully established a VPN connection, to which VPN location, and from which country/ISP. This minimal information assists us in providing technical support, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our Service, and to enable Free VPN Unlimited engineers to identify and fix network issues.
Usage Statistics and Fair Usage Policy
We collect information regarding the total sum of data transferred by a given user. Although we provide unlimited data transfer, we expect users to follow fair usage. If we notice that a single user has significantly higher usage than others, thereby impacting the quality of service for other Free VPN Unlimited users, we may reach out to that user for additional information.

Jurisdiction and Applicable Law
Free VPN Unlimited’s core mission is to keep your information private. In service of this mission, Zoom Labs’s headquarters and registered place of business is in California, USA.
Should we receive a valid legal order from the legal authorities, it is important to note that Free VPN Unlimited does not collect any browsing history, traffic data or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user activity.

Security Measures to Protect Your Information
Free VPN Unlimited uses best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of information. Access to user information is restricted to staff who require such access to perform their job functions.
While we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.
Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices. None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN Services. If any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.
Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers and manage to break its disk encryption, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.

The services are intended for users of any age who have a need to use VPN, in compliance with local laws and regulations.
