Page Not Found
This file does not exist and there was no
index.html
found in the current directory or
404.html
in the root directory.
Why am I seeing this?
You may have deployed the wrong directory for your application.  Check your
firebase.json
and make sure the
public
directory is pointing to a directory that contains an
index.html
file.
You can also add a
404.html
in the root of your site to replace this page with a custom error page.
