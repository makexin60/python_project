Minors
Hilton does not knowingly collect, disclose, or sell personal information of individuals under the age of majority in their respective jurisdiction without permission from a minor’s parent or guardian. When searching for hotel reservations on a Hilton website or on the Hilton Honors app, you may be asked to provide the ages of any minor guests staying in the room. Hilton collects this information for the purpose of determining room rates where applicable, such as at an “all-inclusive” property.
Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)
We use closed circuit television and other security measures at our properties that may capture or record images of guests and visitors in public areas, as well as information related to your location while on our properties (via keycards and other technologies) for the protection of our staff, guests, and visitors to our properties. We retain CCTV in accordance with our data retention policies, as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which that information was collected, or as required or permitted by law. You may be able to request access to CCTV images within the time specified by applicable law and as required by law.
Franchised hotels are operated by entities that are separate from Hilton. To request access to CCTV images from a franchised hotel, please contact that hotel. In addition to Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc., those entities also are independent data controllers of CCTV images. When permitted by law, we may charge an appropriate fee to cover the costs of responding to the request. Such requests may be submitted by accessing the Data Subject Rights Requests Portal at
datarights.hilton.com
or in writing to
DataProtectionOffice@hilton.com
or Hilton Data Protection Officer, 7930 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, VA 22102, USA.

Cookies and Other Technologies
Like many other websites, our site may use "Cookies" or "Other Technologies" (such as "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," links in emails, JavaScript, device IDs assigned by Google or Apple, or similar technologies). Cookies and Other Technologies allow us and third parties to obtain information about your visits to the site, including to analyze your visiting patterns. We use this information to process your reservations or requests and to deliver online and mobile advertisements, messages and content for us and others that are specific to your interests. Depending on your jurisdiction, prior consent for the use of non-essential Cookies may be required. If it is the case, we will obtain your consent before using Cookies on your device.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device ("device") when you visit a website. Cookies alone cannot be used to disclose your individual identity to us, though in some cases we may tie Hilton or third-party Cookies to personal information you have provided to us or that we have otherwise obtained about you. Cookies may be used on the site in order to improve your experience. For example, we will use Cookies to:
Remember your user name and password for future visits so that log-in is easier and faster;
Remember your language and other preferences;
Ensure you obtain all requested information;
Provide a safe and secure service for online transactions;
Track your response to advertisements and website or app content for analysis and the number of times we send you the same advertisement; Measure how many people use the site, and how they use it, so that we may keep it running quickly and efficiently; and
Help us and others deliver communications and content to you that are relevant and responsive to your interests and location.
Below we explain the different types of Cookies that may be used on the site.
Essential Cookies – Essential Cookies are necessary for the site to work, and enable you to move around it and use its services and features. Disabling these Cookies may make the services and features unavailable.
Functional Cookies – We use Functional Cookies to save your settings on the site—settings such as your language preference, or booking information you have previously used when booking a hotel with us. We also use Functional Cookies to store such things as the last hotel you searched for, so that you can easily find it the next time you visit. Some Functional Cookies are essential to viewing maps or videos on our site.
Session Cookies – These types of Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session, and are deleted from your device when you close the browser. We use Session Cookies to support the functionality of the site and to understand your use of the site—that is, which pages you visit, which links you use and how long you stay on each page.
Persistent Cookies – These types of Cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, but are saved on your device for a fixed period of time or until you delete them. Each time you visit the site, the server that set the Cookie will recognize the persistent Cookie saved on your device. We and others use persistent Cookies to store your preferences, so that they are available for your next visit, to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit the site, how often you return, how your use of the site may vary over time and the effectiveness of advertising efforts.
Advertising Cookies – Allow us and other advertisers to show you the most relevant products, offers, and advertisements on the site and third-party sites, or through emails or other message platforms. For example, some Advertising Cookies help our service providers and other advertisers select advertisements that are based on your interests, including those expressed or inferred by visits to our websites or apps or across other websites, online services, and apps over time. Others help prevent the same advertisement from continuously reappearing for you. These types of Cookies also help us provide you with content on the site that is tailored to your interests and needs. As noted below, some Analytics Cookies and Other Technologies are used in part to facilitate advertising.
Social Plug-In Cookies – Advertising Cookies also include Social Plug-In Cookies. Social Plug-In Cookies are used to share content from the site with members and non-members of social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Pinterest. These Cookies are usually set by the social networking provider, enabling such sharing to be smooth and seamless.
Analytics Cookies – Collect information about your use of the site, and enable us to improve the way it works. These Cookies give us aggregated information that we use to monitor site performance, count page visits, spot technical errors, see how users reach the site, and measure the effectiveness of advertising (including emails we send to you).
Other technologies may be used for the same purposes as our Cookies, to allow us and third parties to know when you visit the site, and to understand how you interact with emails or advertisements. Through Other Technologies, non-personal information (e.g., your operating system, your browser version, and the URL you came from) or aggregate information may be obtained and used to enhance your experience and understand traffic patterns.
MANAGING COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

Analytics and Interest-Based Advertisements
We partner with certain third-party service providers to collect information to engage in analytics, auditing, research, and reporting.  These third parties may use server logs, web beacons, tags, pixels, and similar technologies, and they may set and access Cookies on your computer or other device.
In particular, we use Adobe Analytics to help us understand how our customers use our websites. We also use Adobe Audience Manager to create audiences for personalizing content and advertising experiences. Read more about
how Adobe uses your Personal Information
in web browsers by Adobe Analytics.
We partner with Amazon Chat which supports our chat platform. We may use Amazon Chat for sharing dynamic content for authenticated users.
We use WhatsApp to help us send you personalized content and advertising experiences across multiple platforms. We may use WhatsApp for analytics, research, and reporting. We will use your WhatsApp phone number to link you to your existing Hilton account (if available) and leverage your data to enhance our analytics, providing you with a richer customer experience across all channels.

We partner with third parties to provide advertising services that are targeted based on your online activities across websites, mobile apps, and devices over time (commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising”). Our advertising partners may collect information about your activities on our Services on your current device and combine it with information about your activities on other websites, mobile apps, and devices. They may collect such information using server logs, cookies, web beacons, tags, pixels, mobile advertising IDs (such as Facebook cookies or Google's Advertising ID), cross-device linking, and similar technologies. For example, our advertising partners may use the fact that you visited our website to target advertising to you on other websites and mobile apps on your current device or on other devices you use. They may match your browsers or devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household. This means that information about your activity on websites or apps on your current browser or device may be combined and used with information collected from your other browsers or devices. You can opt out of interest-based advertising in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by following the instructions below.
For more information about interest-based advertising and cross-device linking, please visit the
Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) website
and the
Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website
. We adhere to the DAA's interest-based advertising principles by providing you enhanced notice, transparency, and control of our digital marketing practices as stated at
http://www.aboutads.info/principles/
. You may opt out of interest-based advertising and cross-device linking in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by following the instructions below.
Web Browser Opt-Out.

downloading the app
and following the instructions. For more information about opting out on mobile devices, please see

Please note that the opt-outs described above will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out, and therefore you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile advertising identifiers, change browsers (including upgrading certain browsers), or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work, and you will need to opt out again.

How We Protect Personal Information
We take reasonable measures to: (i) protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, and (ii) keep personal information accurate and up-to-date as appropriate.
Hilton employs a robust team of dedicated information security professionals who are responsible for managing Hilton's security program. This team is responsible for, among many other things, monitoring our systems for potential intrusions, responding to potential incidents, supporting property-level information security, regularly reviewing and updating the security controls Hilton uses to protect data, and providing training on Hilton's information security program.
Hilton maintains a payment card industry (“PCI”) compliance program and an Information Technology compliance program. This compliance program generates audit reports concerning the adequacy and effectiveness of Hilton's Technology internal controls, including a PCI Attestation of Compliance signed by an external PCI Qualified Security Assessor and a SSAE16/SOC1 report addressing the Technology general controls over systems that support certain accounting and financial reporting.
We require third parties with whom we share personal information to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of personal information.
We will never ask you to send us confidential personal information or payment card information via email or text message.
In the event of a security incident, Hilton will notify regulators and/or consumers as required by applicable laws and regulations.

Disclosure Pursuant to Legal Obligations or to Protect the Safety and Security of People and Property
Hilton will disclose personal information as required by law. Examples of such disclosures include when countries require Hilton to collect personal data about visitors to properties in that country, when a law enforcement agency serves a valid subpoena on Hilton, and when a civil litigant serves a lawful discovery request on Hilton. Hilton may elect to share personal information with law enforcement, employers, those who host events with Hilton, or others as necessary to protect the safety and security of people and property, to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain, and to respond to an emergency.

Minors
Hilton does not knowingly collect, disclose, or sell personal information of individuals under the age of majority in their respective jurisdiction without permission from a minor’s parent or guardian. When searching for hotel reservations on a Hilton website or on the Hilton Honors app, you may be asked to provide the ages of any minor guests staying in the room. Hilton collects this information for the purpose of determining room rates where applicable, such as at an “all-inclusive” property.
Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)
We use closed circuit television and other security measures at our properties that may capture or record images of guests and visitors in public areas, as well as information related to your location while on our properties (via keycards and other technologies) for the protection of our staff, guests, and visitors to our properties. We retain CCTV in accordance with our data retention policies, as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which that information was collected, or as required or permitted by law. You may be able to request access to CCTV images within the time specified by applicable law and as required by law.
Franchised hotels are operated by entities that are separate from Hilton. To request access to CCTV images from a franchised hotel, please contact that hotel. In addition to Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc., those entities also are independent data controllers of CCTV images. When permitted by law, we may charge an appropriate fee to cover the costs of responding to the request. Such requests may be submitted by accessing the Data Subject Rights Requests Portal at
datarights.hilton.com
or in writing to
DataProtectionOffice@hilton.com
or Hilton Data Protection Officer, 7930 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, VA 22102, USA.

Cookies and Other Technologies
Like many other websites, our site may use "Cookies" or "Other Technologies" (such as "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," links in emails, JavaScript, device IDs assigned by Google or Apple, or similar technologies). Cookies and Other Technologies allow us and third parties to obtain information about your visits to the site, including to analyze your visiting patterns. We use this information to process your reservations or requests and to deliver online and mobile advertisements, messages and content for us and others that are specific to your interests. Depending on your jurisdiction, prior consent for the use of non-essential Cookies may be required. If it is the case, we will obtain your consent before using Cookies on your device.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device ("device") when you visit a website. Cookies alone cannot be used to disclose your individual identity to us, though in some cases we may tie Hilton or third-party Cookies to personal information you have provided to us or that we have otherwise obtained about you. Cookies may be used on the site in order to improve your experience. For example, we will use Cookies to:
Remember your user name and password for future visits so that log-in is easier and faster;
Remember your language and other preferences;
Ensure you obtain all requested information;
Provide a safe and secure service for online transactions;
Track your response to advertisements and website or app content for analysis and the number of times we send you the same advertisement; Measure how many people use the site, and how they use it, so that we may keep it running quickly and efficiently; and
Help us and others deliver communications and content to you that are relevant and responsive to your interests and location.
Below we explain the different types of Cookies that may be used on the site.
Essential Cookies – Essential Cookies are necessary for the site to work, and enable you to move around it and use its services and features. Disabling these Cookies may make the services and features unavailable.
Functional Cookies – We use Functional Cookies to save your settings on the site—settings such as your language preference, or booking information you have previously used when booking a hotel with us. We also use Functional Cookies to store such things as the last hotel you searched for, so that you can easily find it the next time you visit. Some Functional Cookies are essential to viewing maps or videos on our site.
Session Cookies – These types of Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session, and are deleted from your device when you close the browser. We use Session Cookies to support the functionality of the site and to understand your use of the site—that is, which pages you visit, which links you use and how long you stay on each page.
Persistent Cookies – These types of Cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, but are saved on your device for a fixed period of time or until you delete them. Each time you visit the site, the server that set the Cookie will recognize the persistent Cookie saved on your device. We and others use persistent Cookies to store your preferences, so that they are available for your next visit, to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit the site, how often you return, how your use of the site may vary over time and the effectiveness of advertising efforts.
Advertising Cookies – Allow us and other advertisers to show you the most relevant products, offers, and advertisements on the site and third-party sites, or through emails or other message platforms. For example, some Advertising Cookies help our service providers and other advertisers select advertisements that are based on your interests, including those expressed or inferred by visits to our websites or apps or across other websites, online services, and apps over time. Others help prevent the same advertisement from continuously reappearing for you. These types of Cookies also help us provide you with content on the site that is tailored to your interests and needs. As noted below, some Analytics Cookies and Other Technologies are used in part to facilitate advertising.
Social Plug-In Cookies – Advertising Cookies also include Social Plug-In Cookies. Social Plug-In Cookies are used to share content from the site with members and non-members of social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Pinterest. These Cookies are usually set by the social networking provider, enabling such sharing to be smooth and seamless.
Analytics Cookies – Collect information about your use of the site, and enable us to improve the way it works. These Cookies give us aggregated information that we use to monitor site performance, count page visits, spot technical errors, see how users reach the site, and measure the effectiveness of advertising (including emails we send to you).
Other technologies may be used for the same purposes as our Cookies, to allow us and third parties to know when you visit the site, and to understand how you interact with emails or advertisements. Through Other Technologies, non-personal information (e.g., your operating system, your browser version, and the URL you came from) or aggregate information may be obtained and used to enhance your experience and understand traffic patterns.
MANAGING COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

We partner with certain third-party service providers to collect information to engage in analytics, auditing, research, and reporting.  These third parties may use server logs, web beacons, tags, pixels, and similar technologies, and they may set and access Cookies on your computer or other device.
In particular, we use Adobe Analytics to help us understand how our customers use our websites. We also use Adobe Audience Manager to create audiences for personalizing content and advertising experiences. Read more about

We partner with third parties to provide advertising services that are targeted based on your online activities across websites, mobile apps, and devices over time (commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising”). Our advertising partners may collect information about your activities on our Services on your current device and combine it with information about your activities on other websites, mobile apps, and devices. They may collect such information using server logs, cookies, web beacons, tags, pixels, mobile advertising IDs (such as Facebook cookies or Google's Advertising ID), cross-device linking, and similar technologies. For example, our advertising partners may use the fact that you visited our website to target advertising to you on other websites and mobile apps on your current device or on other devices you use. They may match your browsers or devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household. This means that information about your activity on websites or apps on your current browser or device may be combined and used with information collected from your other browsers or devices. You can opt out of interest-based advertising in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by following the instructions below.
For more information about interest-based advertising and cross-device linking, please visit the
Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) website
and the
Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website
. We adhere to the DAA's interest-based advertising principles by providing you enhanced notice, transparency, and control of our digital marketing practices as stated at
http://www.aboutads.info/principles/
. You may opt out of interest-based advertising and cross-device linking in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by following the instructions below.

downloading the app
and following the instructions. For more information about opting out on mobile devices, please see

How We Protect Personal Information
We take reasonable measures to: (i) protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, and (ii) keep personal information accurate and up-to-date as appropriate.
Hilton employs a robust team of dedicated information security professionals who are responsible for managing Hilton's security program. This team is responsible for, among many other things, monitoring our systems for potential intrusions, responding to potential incidents, supporting property-level information security, regularly reviewing and updating the security controls Hilton uses to protect data, and providing training on Hilton's information security program.
Hilton maintains a payment card industry (“PCI”) compliance program and an Information Technology compliance program. This compliance program generates audit reports concerning the adequacy and effectiveness of Hilton's Technology internal controls, including a PCI Attestation of Compliance signed by an external PCI Qualified Security Assessor and a SSAE16/SOC1 report addressing the Technology general controls over systems that support certain accounting and financial reporting.
We require third parties with whom we share personal information to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of personal information.
We will never ask you to send us confidential personal information or payment card information via email or text message.
In the event of a security incident, Hilton will notify regulators and/or consumers as required by applicable laws and regulations.

Disclosure Pursuant to Legal Obligations or to Protect the Safety and Security of People and Property
Hilton will disclose personal information as required by law. Examples of such disclosures include when countries require Hilton to collect personal data about visitors to properties in that country, when a law enforcement agency serves a valid subpoena on Hilton, and when a civil litigant serves a lawful discovery request on Hilton. Hilton may elect to share personal information with law enforcement, employers, those who host events with Hilton, or others as necessary to protect the safety and security of people and property, to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain, and to respond to an emergency.

此外，在某些情况下（例如我们将信息用于直接营销的情况），您可以拒绝处理您的个人信息的活动。
例如，如果满足您的请求将泄露关于他人的个人信息，或您要求我们删除法律要求我们保留或我们为针对自身的索赔辩护所需的信息，则可能会限制这些权利。此外，Adobe 网站可识别某些 Web 浏览器中提供的全局隐私控制。如果将您的浏览器配置为发送此信号，则 Adobe 将为您阻止 Adobe 在该浏览器上使用广告 Cookie。可在

PART I: Workspace ONE UEM and Omnissa Mobile Applications
This section covers Omnissa’s unified endpoint management software, Workspace ONE UEM, including the related Omnissa mobile applications.
a. Overview of Workspace ONE UEM
Workspace ONE UEM (“UEM”) enables Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned devices. UEM provides the Customer with controls which enable them to manage the access and security of its User’s devices. UEM consists of a Customer-specific console, which enables the Customer to manage its Users’ devices (“Console”) and software that is installed on a User’s device, which (i) facilitates communication between the User’s device and the Console, as well as other third-party endpoints (e.g. Apple or Google API) depending on Customer’s configuration, and (ii) provides the User with various productivity applications (i.e. an email client, a web browser, etc.). The specific features available to a Customer or a Customer’s Users will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. The Console may be hosted by the Customer in its own IT environment (“On-Prem”) or may be hosted by Omnissa (“Hosted Service”).
b. Console controls
The Console provides Customers with controls to assist them in complying with their legal obligations and internal compliance programs and requirements. The specific features available to a Customer or a Customer’s Users will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. For example, the Customer can set password complexity, password expiration, and the timing for screen lockouts through the Console for the User’s device. Customer can also choose to enable different settings for corporate-owned devices and User-owned devices. Some of the other options available to Customers are outlined below:
i. Infrastructure.
The Customer chooses whether to host the Console On-Prem or whether to have the Console hosted by Omnissa through the Hosted Service. If a customer wants to maintain greater control over the environment hosting the Console, including the security thereof, the Customer can choose to host the Console On-Prem rather than having the Console hosted by Omnissa. The collected data is available to the Customer via the Console and Omnissa has no access to the data. If the Customer has chosen the Hosted Service, then Omnissa will also have access to the data collected through the Console; however, Omnissa only uses that data as stated in Omnissa’s General Terms and this Privacy Notice.
ii. Data collection.
Using the Console, the Customer has the ability to control the types of information they collect about Users’ devices. Additionally, the Console gives the Customer the ability to have different data collection practices for corporate-dedicated, corporate-shared, and User-owned devices. For example, through the Console, the Customer can enable or disable the collection of the following data:
GPS data
Carrier/Country code
Roaming status
Cellular usage data
Call usage
SMS usage
Device phone number
Personal applications
Unmanaged profiles
Public IP address
iii. Device commands
. Using the Console, the Customer can elect to allow/prevent certain commands and can decide whether the execution of a command requires the User’s permission:
Device wipe
Clear device passcode/lock device
File manager access
Remote control
Registry manager
Request device log
Command line/remote shell access
iv. Display of User data
. The Console also contains settings that enable the Customer to decide what User data should be visible to its IT administrators via the Console. For example, the Customer can decide whether the following User data is visible to its IT administrators in the Console:
First name
Last name
Phone number
Email accounts
User name
c. Collection of User and device data through the UEM
User data that may be collected by UEM varies depending on the specific version/bundle purchased by the Customer, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. Examples of the data that may be collected by UEM are provided below.
i. General User and device data collected by UEM
In connection with its core enterprise mobility management functions, UEM collects user and device data such as the following:
Identity and authentication information
Identity details (including name, email address, phone number, etc.)
Login credentials and security authentication data (including certificates, domain information, login and logout dates and times, usernames, enrollment IDs, etc.). Workspace ONE UEM does not store user credentials derived from customer Active Directory (AD) integration.
Employment information
Employer, job title, work address, employee number
Information maintained in the Customer’s Active Directory
Device information
Device type, name, make, model, manufacturer, and device identifiers such as universal unique identifier (“UUID”), International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (“IMEI”), mobile equipment identifier (“MEID”), serial number, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (“IMSI”) number, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and Media Access Control (“MAC”) address
Last seen information (i.e., when the device last connected to the Console), log data
Information about the device’s operating system (including operating system build, version, firmware/kernel versions, etc.)
Battery capacity and availability, memory capacity and availability, storage capacity and availability
Installed profiles on the device, including configuration data of Users’ devices and compliance status concerning requirements defined by the Customer in its Console settings
Information about the device’s file manager and registry manager (Android/Windows devices)
UEM also may collect user and device data in connection with the following:
Data about Customer-Managed Applications
“Customer-Managed Applications” are Customer approved applications that are either pushed to User devices by the Customer or made available for download through the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub app (formerly the AirWatch Agent), Workspace ONE App Catalog, or Customer application catalogues. These mobile applications may be public applications or internally-created applications. Information collected in connection with Customer-Managed Applications may include:
Names and details of Customer-Managed Applications installed on the device, such as application name, version number, file size, configuration settings, installation progress status, app failure error codes, etc.
Technical data generated from the use of Customer-Managed Applications, such as launch activities, clickstream data, crash reports and log files, which may contain personal data about the User.
Data about Personal Applications:
“Personal Applications” are the applications Users purchase or download from a public app store (e.g. the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store) to their devices. They are not automatically pushed to the User’s devices by Customer and are not managed via UEM. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, UEM may collect limited details about Personal Applications to assist the Customer in knowing/verifying that its Users do not download Personal Applications which may pose a security threat. UEM does not collect or have access to any data inside any Personal Applications. The information collected about Personal Applications may include:
Name, version, identifier, and total size of Personal Applications installed on the deviceh
File manager access:
File manager access is functionality that allows read-only access to a device’s internal and external storage. Certain mobile applications (such as Workspace ONE Content, formerly known as Omnissa Content Locker) may request file manager access from a User so that data may be synced between the User’s device and the Customer’s systems, files could be attached to emails that the User wants to send, etc. When enabled, UEM may collect the contents of the device storage, including the SD card and locally stored files. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, certain applications like Workspace ONE Assist may have read and write access to the device file system based on the platform type and the permissions granted by the User.
Telecom and network information:
UEM may collect certain telecom data, such as carrier information, roaming status, and networks being used. This information helps the Customer know how the device is connected, to communicate with the device, and to enforce any restrictions implemented by Customer in its use of UEM, such as preventing large applications from automatically being pushed to a device that is roaming. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, this telecom and network information may include the following:
Carrier information (including carrier settings versions, phone number, signal strength, roaming status, current and subscriber mobile country code and country location, current and subscriber mobile network code, SIM Carrier Network information, etc.)
Information about the device’s cellular technology (such as its Global System for Mobile Communications Standard (“GSM”) and Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”))
SSID, Internet Protocol (“IP”) and Media Access Control (“MAC”) addresses for the Wi-Fi network being used
Amount of data used by the network connections, cellular data usage, and aggregated information about Wi-Fi bandwidth consumption (excluding content)
Communication data:
The Customer may configure UEM to collect usage information, such as the number of calls and text messages sent or received. This information may assist the Customer in managing SMS limits on the Customer’s cellular plan. UEM does not collect or have access to the contents of text messages, phone calls, or personal email accounts. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, this communications data may include:
The amount of data used, the number of SMS sent or received, phone call usage statistics (number of calls sent or received, duration of calls), broken down on an enrolled device phone number basis
Name of sender, name of recipient, date, time
Geo-location data:
Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, UEM may collect geo-location data. By default, it does not collect geo-location data. UEM enables the Customer to collect geo-location data as it may enable a Customer to locate lost devices or to distribute functionality and content based on certain geo-fenced locations. Depending on the operating system and platform of the device, the User may be presented with an operating system notice, asking for the User’s consent to collect geo-location data. The User can change their selection by going into their device settings and revoking the geo-location permission.
Data via remote access:
The Customer can use UEM to establish remote control access, which allows a Customer’s IT administrators to assist in troubleshooting a User’s device issue by remotely taking control of the device. A remote-control application must be installed on the device and, depending on platform and configuration, remote control may need to be approved by the User at the time when remote control is to be taken. This functionality enables the Customer to remotely access or control the device, including the use of remote locks, screen capture, remote device reboots or remote restart (for the device or applications).
ii. Additional data for specialized Omnissa Mobile App functionality
Omnissa provides various mobile applications in connection with UEM (“Omnissa Mobile Apps”). Some of these Omnissa Mobile Apps collect or share additional data in order to support their specialized functionality. For example, Omnissa Mobile Apps that provide VPN or internet browsing functionality (such as Boxer and Web) collect the URLs visited through those Omnissa Mobile Apps. The data collected and shared will vary depending on the functionality provided by the mobile application, as detailed further in the product documentation. Below are some examples of this additional data collected by specific Omnissa Mobile Apps:
Omnissa Workspace ONE Boxer.
Workspace ONE Boxer provides access to enterprise email, calendar and contacts. Boxer does not host the email or calendar content; instead, Boxer provides direct communication between the Customer’s backend email system and the User’s device. To operate, Boxer collects certain email header information (such as sender/recipient name, date, time, subject line, etc.) If configured to do so, Boxer has access to User device calendars to overlay the User’s corporate calendar and access to User device contacts to display them in Boxer as well as to write corporate contacts to the device contact app for call identification purposes. Boxer may also be configured to collect header information and snippets of the email body in order to generate a contextual notification and send to a User’s mobile device to deliver updates of incoming messages. The User can enable/disable these features via the UEM Console and mobile device operating system settings.  Workspace ONE Boxer’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google Accounts will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
Omnissa Workspace ONE Web.
Workspace ONE Web provides Users with secure VPN access to internet and intranet sites. It may also provide single sign-on capabilities allowing Users with access to the Customer designated web sites and web apps without the need to enter credentials. Web enables direct communication between Web on the User’s device and Customer’s backend systems. To operate, Web collects certain additional information such as the browser information and browsing history on the User’s device. Web records the URLs of websites and web pages viewed using Web but Web does not give Omnissa access to the content viewed using Web. (For clarity, UEM may have access to that content to the extent the Customer maintains the content in Omnissa Hosted Services.)
Omnissa Workspace ONE Content.
Workspace ONE Content allows Customer content to be uploaded, stored, edited, shared and accessed from a User’s device. The content is stored in a corporate container on the User’s device or in a managed server-side repository, which the Customer may host using UEM (either On-Prem or in the Hosted Service, depending on the Customer’s deployment) or which the Customer may maintain in third-party services. The Content mobile app allows the User to securely access, distribute and collaborate on content from their device. The Customer may configure Content to allow or limit access to certain content. If Content is used, UEM will have access to data such as the date and times when files are accessed and shared, file size, file names, a history of User actions inside the Content, and details regarding with whom the User interacts through Content. Content has a geo-fencing feature that allows the Customer’s IT administrators to place geo-fencing restrictions on access to content stored in Content. The geo-fencing feature does not transmit the User’s geo-location data to the Console; instead, the Content mobile application uses the geo-location data locally on the device to perform the geo-fencing.
Omnissa Workspace ONE Assist.
The Workspace ONE Assist application provides Customer’s IT and support personnel with the ability to remotely view and control the device screen and applications, managed files and run commands with the User’s permission. Assist also provides the ability to capture screenshots and record the device screen for troubleshooting and training purposes. The level of access is configurable by the Customer.
OEM Supplements to Agent App.
For certain Customers, Omnissa operates customized OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer referring to the hardware or platform manufacturer) mobile applications that accompany its standard Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub, used for mobile device management. These OEM mobile applications may offer additional functionality and collect additional data points based on the Customer’s and/or device’s specifications. For example, this may include information about carrier codes, battery health, and other data related to the Customer’s device or product specifications.
Workspace ONE Tunnel App
. The app is used to securely provide either per-App or Full Device VPN capabilities across all employees’ devices and is delivered with a modern Zero Trust architecture. It is a part of the
AnyWhere Workspace
solution set for enabling remote work and enforcing endpoint compliance.To operate, Tunnel collects certain additional information such as application bundle IDs, URLs accessed through managed applications, device network information, diagnostic information such as crash logs, service start/stop events, network errors, and runtime exceptions. Tunnel provides the user to opt out for data collection for information such as crash logs.
Workspace ONE Launcher
application helps organizations securely manage shared Android devices, especially for frontline workers. It allows devices to be configured in single or multi-app kiosk mode, ensuring that workers only have access to the apps and settings they need to perform their tasks. This tool improves security by locking devices to specific configurations and also supports check-in/check-out functionality, allowing different users to share a device while keeping their sessions secure and private. Customer administrators can fully customize the user interface (UI), manage device settings remotely, and enforce device restrictions, such as disabling notifications or access to certain settings. The Omnissa Workspace ONE Launcher is particularly beneficial in industries where shared devices are common, such as logistics, retail, and healthcare, as it simplifies device management while maintaining a high level of security and worker productivity. The Omnissa Workspace ONE Launcher collects the following permissions and data:
Permissions required to be granted by the user manually:
a. Mandatory
UsageAccess Permission
DrawOverOtherApps Permission
b. As needed for the features configured
Notifications Access permission
Write Settings Permission
All File Access permission
Daily application usage and application performance metrics, such as total session time, longest and shortest app session, battery drain per hour, data consumption (for that day)
Permission acquired automatically from the Device Policy Controller DPC/Workspace ONE Hub
a. Location access: depending on the customer configuration, this could be coarse location or precise location
b. Internet Usage, such as content download/upload, API Calls, communication, etc.
c. Network state
d. “Read phone state”  which is an Android permission that allows Omnissa Workspace ONE Launcher to access a device's phone number, current network information, and the status of any calls,
e. Call Phone allowing or denying ability to make a phone call
f. Read and write external storage
g. Post Notifications (i.e.,  ability to send and control app notifications)
iii. Software Development Kit (SDK).
The Workspace ONE Software Development Kit (“Workspace ONE SDK”) is a code library that mobile app developers can use to build security, configurations and management capabilities into their own, non-Omnissa mobile applications. Apps that use the Workspace ONE SDK collect and transmit certain data back to Omnissa, such as identity and authentication information and device information as described above, as well as crash reporting data and analytics data as described below. When an app uses the Workspace ONE SDK to provide tunneling functionality, the app also transmits to Omnissa’s systems the URLs of the sites accessed using that tunneling functionality. Developers of third-party apps that use the Workspace ONE SDK also may configure the Workspace ONE SDK to collect other custom data points as they determine in their discretion. This Privacy Disclosure describes only Omnissa’s collection of user data from the Workspace ONE SDK; it does not address the practices of third-party developers that may incorporate the Workspace ONE SDK into their non-Omnissa mobile apps.
d. Intel Device Health and Chip to Cloud
This section covers Intel Device Health and Chip to Cloud, which are optional add-on features powered by Intel and available for select Workspace ONE SKUs.
i. Overview of the Intel Device Health service.
Intel Device Health (IDH) helps Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned laptops. IDH does this by helping to detect threats to the security of those laptops, particularly firmware-related threats. IDH threat analysis information is fed back to the Workspace ONE console where Customers can see and evaluate potential vulnerabilities of enrolled laptops. Customers may use this information to respond to threats by, for example, requiring end users to update their OS.
ii. IDH data collection.
If IDH is enabled, enrolled laptops send data directly to Intel. Collected data includes information about installed operating system, Intel-based applications, drivers and BIOS; information about the device such as manufacturer, model number, serial number, SKU, and motherboard and CPU details; and country.  Intel sends threat analysis results to Omnissa for display in the Workspace ONE console.
iii. Use of IDH data by Intel.
Intel uses the data collected not only to deliver the IDH threat analysis service, but also to enhance its own threat intelligence and threat detection capabilities. For information about how Intel will use that data, see the
Intel Privacy Notice
.
iv. Chip to Cloud.
Chip to Cloud functionality enables administrators to remotely perform power actions on Intel Active Management Technology (AMT)-enabled managed devices such as Power On, Power Off, Reset, and Power Cycle. Administrators may also remotely access the device to assume KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) control, including seeing the end user’s screen, if the end user provides consent to such remote access at that time.
e. Device wiping
UEM allows for two different types of device wiping:
Enterprise Wipe
– An Enterprise Wipe deletes all Customer-Managed Applications and any information stored in the Customer-Managed Applications. Enterprise Wipes will not remove Personal Applications or photos, videos, text messages, or personal email stored in Personal Applications.
Full Device Wipe
– A Full Device Wipe is a complete full factory reset. Full Device Wipes will remove all data and applications from the device.
The Customer’s IT administrator may select which device wiping feature is enabled and can perform these wipes from the Console, either manually or via an automated compliance action. The ability to perform a Full Device Wipe for a device cannot be turned on for a particular device after enrollment, meaning if the setting is off when the User enrolls the device, the Customer cannot perform a Full Device Wipe on a User’s device even if the Customer enables the Full Device Wipe setting in the Console. Depending on the Customer’s configuration, Users may be able to choose to perform an Enterprise Wipe on their devices from the self-service portal.
PART II: Omnissa Access
This section covers Omnissa Access (formerly Omnissa Identity Manager, "Access"), which enables identity and access management as part of the Workspace ONE platform. Omnissa Access use cases include but are not limited to single sign on, multifactor authentication, conditional access, and identity security.
a. Overview of Omnissa Access
Omnissa Access combines the User’s identity with factors such as device and network information to make intelligence driven, conditional access decisions for applications delivered by Workspace ONE. Access acts as a broker to other identity stores and providers (such as Active Directory (AD), Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Azure AD, Okta and Ping Identity) that Customers may already be using to enable authentication across on-premises, SaaS, web and native applications without the need to rearchitect the identity environment.
b. Collection of User and device data through Access
i. User data.
Omnissa Access collects data about Users who are using the Workspace ONE platform. Typically, the data is synced from Customer’s directory with certain required attributes, as well as optional attributes that Customers can configure. Required User data that is synced with Access:
Username
Email
First and last name
Customers can customize additional attributes to sync to Access for the purposes of policy creation or application entitlements.
ii. Authentication data.
When Users log in to the Workspace ONE platform using their username and password credentials, Omnissa does not store credentials in Access, but validates Users’ input by reaching out to Customer’s directory that Access has been integrated with, and validating the credentials.
In some cases, Access may cache credentials for the duration of User sessions on a User’s device to enable features such as integration with other applications like Omnissa Horizon® or Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops to prevent double prompting when Users launch virtual resources. This functionality can be configured or disabled by Customer’s IT admin using Access.
Customers can also enable other authentication methods that do not involve credentials such as certificate-based authentication. To use certificate authentication, Customer IT administrators must upload root certificates and intermediate certificates to the Omnissa Access connector. The certificates are copied to the local certificate store on the User device. These certificates are not replicated in the Omnissa Access database.
The macOS Platform Single Sign-On (MPSSO) feature utilizes Apple's Platform Single Sign-On to synchronize the macOS device password with the User’s corporate password. Users are prompted to register their macO device and link their local account with Omnissa Access. After registration, the local account password syncs with the Identity Provider (IdP) password, enabling users to sign in to macOS using their IdP password. MPSSO replaces the user's local macOS password with their IdP password. Omnissa Access receives and processes the encrypted Identity Provider password, username, device unique identifier (UDID), and IP address from the local device.
iii. Logging data.
Omnissa Access will also generate audit logs for all User activity. For instance, what applications User is launching, time of the launch, authentication methods used, etc. These logs can be retained within Omnissa Access, or they can be sent to Omnissa Intelligence for analytical purposes. For example, User login activity data can be used in Omnissa Intelligence to identify user behavior anomalies and notify the Customer IT administrator. Sending logs to Omnissa Intelligence is configurable and optional functionality.
PART III: Omnissa Workspace ONE Hub Services
This section covers Workspace ONE Hub Services (“Hub Services”), which provide Users with a single destination to access, discover, and connect with corporate resources, applications, teams, and workflows via the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub application.
a. Overview of Workspace ONE Hub Services
Hub Services provide a collection of services that are co-located with Omnissa Access and can be deployed On-Prem or as a Hosted Service. Customers can choose to enable one or more Hub Services capabilities:
Hub catalog.
Provides a branded and customized enterprise app store for native, web and virtual Customer apps for discovery and Single-Sign-On access by Users.
Notifications.
Provides personalized push and in-app notifications to Users of Customer communications including system downtimes, survey participation, and updates around enrollments.
People.
Provides employee directory for quick lookup of colleague information along with an organization chart.
Custom Tab.
Provides access to Customer resources through embeddable intranet or company portal within a customizable tab.
Support.
Provides self-service capability for Users to access helpful links and manage their devices.
Virtual assistant.
Provides Users the ability to find answers to common Customer questions, troubleshoot issues and complete workflows like ordering a new device through a chatbot style interaction.
b. Collection of User and device data through Hub Services
i. Authentication.
Hub Services relies on UEM or Access for user authentication as defined by Customer’s IT administrator in the UEM Console as part of source of authentication configuration.
ii. User data.
Customers can use Hub Service admin console to create and send push notifications to Users. In addition, notifications can be generated based on changes in third-party business systems when integrated via Workspace ONE Mobile Flows. Notification related data generated through Hub Services admin console or Mobile Flows is stored in Hub Services data store. In addition to the notification content, Hub Service collects individual notification acted on state, and target User device identifiers including UUID.
Customers can turn on the app rating feature to collect User feedback. When enabled, Hub Services collects User’s external Id and app Id. Customer IT administrators can download a report of aggregated app ratings with following data points: app name, app ID, platform, app version, app type, catalog provider, likes and dislikes. Hub Services does not disclose individual User ratings for different apps to Customer’s IT administrator.
When User favorites/unfavorites an app, Hub Services stores app Id favorited/unfavorited by User along with the device type to indicate the platform from which User has favorited/unfavorited the app from.
When User searches for a colleague using People tab, Hub Services stores the most recent search result for that User.
iii. Logging data.
Workspace ONE Hub Services generates audit logs for User activity. Hub Services logs the source of authentication (UEM or Access), username, external Id and app Id. For instance, app Id is logged: 1) when Users favorites or unfavorites an app; 2) when Users change the order of apps in favorites tab; 3) when install action is invoked on an app; or 4) when apps are launched from Hub Services app.
PART IV: Omnissa Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense and Mobile Applications Powered by Lookout
This section covers Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense service (“MTD”), which is an optional feature add-on available for Hub Services and is a Hosted Service powered by Lookout, Inc., including the related mobile applications.
a. Overview of Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense service
Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense service helps Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned devices by helping to detect and protect against threats to the security of those devices. MTD provides the Customer with controls which enable them to respond to threats to enrolled mobile devices. MTD consists of a Customer-specific console, which enables the Customer to monitor threats to its Users’ devices (“Console”), and software that is installed on a User’s device. The specific features available, and the applicable on-device software application, will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures MTD, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) are used by the Users. The Console is hosted by Omnissa’s service provider, Lookout, Inc.
b. Console controls
The specific features and settings available through the Console will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) are used by the Users. Customer can also choose to enable different settings for corporate-owned devices and User-owned devices. In the Console, Customers can customize threat classifications and set their own threat response policies accordingly (e.g., Alert, Warn, Block, etc.). Some of the other options available to Customers are outlined below:
i. Data collection
Customer may elect for the Console to maintain a username and email address for each enrolled device, or may elect for the Console to rely solely on a pseudonymized Device ID provided by the UEM platform. With the latter option, Customers’ administrators would need access to the UEM platform to make the association between the device threat data within the Console and the individual User.
ii. Display of User data
Customers may elect to redact certain fields within threat data from administrators’ view within the Console. Fields that may be redacted include IP address and resultant geolocation, SSID of suspect networks, name of suspect apps, and suspect or blocked URLs and domains.
c. Collection of User and device data for MTD
User data that may be collected by MTD varies depending on the specific version/bundle purchased by the Customer, how the Customer configures MTD, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. Examples of data collected by MTD are provided below.
Device and User identifiers
Device type, name, make, model and manufacturer
Username, email address, IP address
Firmware / OS / Configuration data
Information about the device’s operating system (including operating system build, version, firmware/kernel versions, configurations, etc.)
Various security hygiene details such as developer mode status, whether storage encrypted, whether side loading of apps allowed, whether Bluetooth is enabled, whether lock screen is enabled
Application data
No user-generated data from within applications is processed or collected (e.g., messages within a messaging app are not processed or collected)
For Android devices, a list of installed apps and version details are collected for analysis. If the device is managed using Android’s ‘Work Profile,’ the analyzed apps may be limited to those in the Work Profile.
For iOS devices, the list of installed apps is only collected if Customer configures Workspace ONE UEM to provide such information. Customer may configure Workspace ONE UEM to limit the list to work apps.
The name of an app installed on a specific User’s device is only available to the Customer if the app is suspected of posing a threat and if the Customers’ privacy controls permit administrators to see names of suspect apps.
App data collected includes SHA-1 hash, Package name, APK file, Bundle ID & Team ID, app/file name, app bundle/package names, application metadata
Network data
Network name (SSID) and network analysis details are collected for suspect WiFi networks only. Whether the suspect SSID is visible to Customer administrators depends on the Customer’s privacy controls.
Phishing and Content Protection (PCP) cata
Data collected includes blocked and suspect URLs and domains, number of URLs and domains checked and number of URLS and domains blocked or detected as suspect
URLs and domains that Users click on are processed against lists of suspect and blocked URLs and domains. URLs and domains clicked on are not recorded by MTD unless flagged as suspect or blocked. Block lists are established by Customers.
The fact that a User tried to access a blocked or suspect URL or domain, and why the URL or domain was flagged as suspect or blocked, is visible to the Customer Administrators, but the specific blocked or suspect URL or domain is not visible to Customer Administrators.
For Android devices, Customers may configure PCP to apply only to URLs and domains clicked on from apps in the ‘Work Profile.’
For iOS devices, no apps bypass PCP; all URLs and domains clicked on are analyzed.
PART V: Omnissa Intelligence Software
This section covers Omnissa Intelligence (“Intelligence”), which is a Hosted Service built for the Omnissa Workspace ONE platform that provides insights, analytics and automation for the entire digital workspace.
a. Overview of Omnissa Intelligence
Omnissa Intelligence Software provides insights into a Customer’s digital workspace by aggregating and correlating device, application and User data together from multiple data sources in one place to give Customer’s IT administrators a complete view of their entire digital workspace environment. Customers can use reports and dashboards to monitor trends and take actions using the automation feature to mitigate issues. Customers opt-in for Omnissa Intelligence using the UEM console to access the Intelligence console and configure the data sources that Customer wishes to use. Omnissa Intelligence is able to ingest data from the following sources:
Workspace ONE UEM
Omnissa Access
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) data from its database
App Analytics data from Omnissa Intelligence SDK
Workspace ONE Trust Network data from technology partners
b. Collection of User and device data through Omnissa Intelligence Software
i. Data collection from UEM
. UEM data flows to Intelligence only after Customer has opted in. The type of data collected from UEM depend on the privacy controls that the Customer has configured. Refer to the UEM section for details on privacy controls.
The Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub app also sends app health, and device health data from corporate-dedicated and corporate-shared Windows devices directly to Intelligence once Customer opts in to this feature in the UEM console. This data may include app crashes, app hang, OS crashes, boot time, logon/shutdown time, windows service start/stop events, sleep and wake events, and device performance monitoring data. This feature is not available for User-owned devices (BYOD).
Customers can use this data set to create dashboards and reports to monitor different key performance indices (KPIs) for maintenance and visibility. Customers can also use the automation feature to take actions on devices, and issue notifications.
ii. Data collection from Access.
Customers configure Access integration in Intelligence to allow data from Access to flow into the Intelligence platform. The type of data may include app logon and logout events. Please refer to Access section for details.
For example, Customers can use this data set to check User login trend, unique User logins, login failure by authentication method and top 5 apps launched in last week.
iii. Data collection from CVE.
Intelligence retrieves a list of common vulnerabilities and exposure entries from the CVE database. This list includes publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Customers can use this data to measure security threats to their digital workspace and take actions to mitigate issues. Details of these integration and data collection are also provided in Omnissa Intelligence documentation.
iv. Data collection from Trust Network technology partners and other technology partners.
The type of data collected or ingested by Intelligence depends upon the privacy settings and terms of agreement between Customer and Trust Network technology partners and other partners. Workspace ONE Intelligence can integrate with Trust Network technology partners by configuring technology partner’s APIs in Intelligence to ingest data or allowing Customer to create credentials for technology partner to use Intelligence APIs to send data to Intelligence. The type of integration is determined by the Customer.
Sample data available in Intelligence from Trust Network and other technology partners may include but is not limited to:
Device Unique IDs – UDID, IP, MAC, Serial Number
End user’s name
Email address
Apps details
Network information
Apps usage data
Security health of devices
Incident data, such as incident data collected by ServiceNow, containing incident ID, description, device name, caller name and email address, and other details.
Customers can use this data set to improve visibility across their organization for security threats and take actions using the automation feature to take actions to mitigate the risks.
v. Data collection from Intelligence SDK.
By integrating Omnissa Intelligence Software Development Kit (the “Intelligence SDK”), Customers can analyze and interact with data about app engagement, app failures, network insights, and user flows. Sample of data may include:
App start
Crashes
Handled exceptions
Network errors
Latency
Carrier details
Latitude and longitude of the device
Omnissa mobile applications also use Intelligence SDK. Please visit UEM section for details.
Customers use this data set to find the root cause of crashes and other application errors quickly, and to prioritize which crashes need to be fixed in order to improve application engagement and usage.
Details of this integration and data collection are also provided in Omnissa Intelligence documentation.
c. Omnissa Experience Management
The Omnissa experience management, built on top of the Omnissa Intelligence, measures digital workspace experience, analyzes the data, helps deliver an enjoyable employee experience and remediate issues that may arise. Experience Management utilizes the device performance, connectivity, and app performance data collected by Omnissa Intelligence and monitors such data to identify, predict, and help to proactively mitigate potential issues, such as poor user experience or non-satisfactory app performance. Customers may choose to ingest data, such as network data or application performance data
,
from other internal or third-party sources.
The Web application performance monitoring feature measures the web application performance through the end user's perspective. This feature gathers web application availability and network performance between the user device and the web application(s) the user is using. This feature is disabled by default. When the feature is enabled, web app information & URL are collected. Administrators requiring this use case/feature can enable the feature in the Settings page. The available settings include (i) collect telemetry specific to the admin-defined list (e.g.,
www.omnissa.com
,
www.omnissa.com/products
) and (ii) specify collecting subpages/directories under the admin defined URL list - similar to use of a wildcard.
PART VI: Omnissa Security Events Service
The Security Events Service routes security events between systems such as Workspace ONE UEM and Customer’s third-party Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) receiver service, e.g. an IdP. The sending of an event is triggered by device’s compliance status change. The Security Events Service does not process the meaning or implication of individual security events; using existing standards aiming to help with sharing security message, CAEP, the service relays the events observed by Omnissa’s Workspace ONE UEM hosted service to Customer’s selected third-party CAEP receiver to give additional context.
The following data is temporarily processed by the Security Events Service and is sent to Customer’s selected CAEP receiver:
End-user email address
Device ID
Device compliance status change details
Other data configured by the Customer
Upon processing an event, the Security Events Service produces an audit log which is available for the Customer to view in the service’s UI. Such log is retained for 90 days and is then deleted.
PART VII: Crash Reporting
The Software can collect crash reports, including those from the Omnissa Mobile Apps (“Crash Reports”). A Customer IT administrator can disable the collection of Crash Reports via the Console settings. Crash Reports may contain User data, such as IP/MAC address, device Information (including unique identifiers, device type, carrier, operating system, model, system, etc.), and geo-location information. Crash Reports are provided to the Customer via the Software to enable the Customer to troubleshoot User issues. Omnissa may also use Crash Reports to improve our products and services and troubleshoot and provide support to our Customers.
PART VIII: Analytics Data
Omnissa collects certain configuration, performance, usage and other analytics data from our Customers and our Customer’s Users for a variety of purposes including to improve our products and services, fix problems, help us understand better how our Customers use our products and services, and advise our Customers on how best to deploy and use our products and services. There are several different data collection programs that a Customer/User may participate in when using the Workspace ONE branded products and services. Please see the Omnissa Trust Center page for more information.
PART IX: Service Operations Data
Omnissa may monitor and collect configuration, performance, usage, and consumption data relating to Customer’s and its Users’ use of the Software to facilitate the delivery and operation of the products and services (collectively, “Service Operations Data”) as described in the Omnissa Products & Services Privacy Notices
PART X: User Transparency
As part of the device enrollment process, the Software pushes a privacy dialog to the User’s mobile device, which enables the User to review a summary of the settings enabled for the Software on their device. In some cases, the User may also have the ability to control the enablement of certain features of the Software, via the self-service portal and/or their device settings. Most Omnissa Mobile Apps made available by Omnissa have a privacy dialog that includes (i) an overview of the data collected by the mobile application, (ii) the permissions that the mobile application will request, and (iii) an option to send analytics data to Omnissa (unless the Customer has disabled the sending of analytics data for all Users). The Software also provides functionality that Customers can use through the Console to provide Users with a link to their privacy notice via the privacy dialog.
The portions of the Software that allow devices to be monitored by the Console run in the background of the devices, and may not provide additional notice when these functions are occurring in real time.
PART XI: Data Subject Access Requests
Omnissa has no direct relationship with the Users whose data it processes in connection with providing the Software and any related services. A User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to the Customer. If the Customer requests Omnissa to modify or remove the data, we will respond to the Customer’s request in accordance with our agreement with the applicable Customer or as may otherwise be required by applicable law.
PART XII: Security and Confidentiality
Omnissa maintains (and require our service providers to maintain) appropriate organizational and technical measures designed to protect the security and confidentiality of any personal information we process. These measures include physical access controls, encryption, Internet firewalls, intrusion detection and network monitoring depending on the nature of the information and the scope of processing. Omnissa staff who may have access to personal information are required to keep that information confidential. Despite these controls, we cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of your information and encourage you to take steps to protect your information when disclosing personal information online by using readily available tools, such as Internet firewalls, anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and similar technologies.

") and our group companies operate in Singapore, Germany, Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom ("
UK
"), Ireland, Romania, Brazil, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. Braze works with vendors and partners who operate predominantly in these countries.

This means that when we collect your Personal Data, we may process it in any of these countries. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective), but we have in place appropriate safeguards and international transfer mechanisms (e.g., the Data Privacy Framework or the EU Standard Contractual Clauses). We also implement a number of supplementary measures designed to better protect the Personal Data with which we are entrusted.
Where available, Braze, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, as applicable, to the US in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework.

We use a number of technical, organizational and administrative security measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of information. However, security risk is inherent in internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data.
3.3 DATA RETENTION
We will retain Personal Data we collect from you for so long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (in connection with the purposes set out in Part II above). We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the purpose for which we process the Personal Data, the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymize it.
PART IV. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS

PART V. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA
If you are from a region that requires us to have a legal basis for processing your Personal Data, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

PART VI. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
If you are a California resident, this section applies to you in addition to the rest of the Privacy Policy.

CCPA
”). However, this Part VI does not apply:

In addition, you have the right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information as those terms are defined by the CCPA.
If you have appointed an authorized agent to act on your behalf, your authorized agent may request to exercise these rights on your behalf upon our verification of the agent’s identity and our receipt of a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable California law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you and/or your agent to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as information required to verify your identity and that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

Our use of some of these services constitutes the “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information as defined under the CCPA.
You may opt-out of such sales or sharing by clicking on the 'Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information'
link
in the footer of our Websites and following the instructions therein. You can also opt-out of advertising cookies by
visiting our Cookie Consent Manager to adjust your cookie preferences
, or by enabling
Global Privacy Control

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or where expressly set forth in an applicable Order Form, (i) payment obligations are non-cancelable, Fees are non-refundable, and failure to use the Services provisioned does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay Fees, and (ii) Services purchased cannot be decreased during the service period for which they were purchased.
6.2 Payments & Invoicing.
To the extent you procure the Services with an applicable Order Form, invoices for the applicable Fees shall be sent to you via email to the email address(es) you designate in your account when signing up for Services, and you shall pay the Fees due upon receipt of such invoice. To the extent you procure the Services under an applicable Order Form, any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All Fees set forth in an applicable Order Form shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated therein. Fees are payable in United States dollars. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from your financial institution and intermediary banks. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
6.3 Payment by Credit Card.
In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
6.4 Payment Disputes.
If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
6.5 Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration.
Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees thirty (30) days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or canceling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
6.6 Taxes.
Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "Taxes"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
6.7 Withholding Taxes.
In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("
Withholding Tax
"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
6.8 Overdue Charges.
If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form. You are prohibited from creating new accounts until the Fees due are paid in full.
6.9 Term for Paid Services.
Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either Party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.

will be considered a material breach of this Agreement. Termination by Branch for material breach of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured.

Except where there are any Order Form(s) in effect, Branch may terminate your use of the Services without prior notice for any reason at any time by providing you with written notice.

. You shall pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form or, if there is no Order Form executed by the Parties, you shall pay the fees set forth at the applicable rates available at
https://branch.io/pricing/
, or its successor URL (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Services, or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in an applicable Order Form, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed for the term of the Order Form.
6.2 Payments & Invoicing
. To the extent you procure the Services with an applicable Order Form(s), invoices for the applicable Fees shall be sent to you via email to the email address(es) you designate in your account when signing up for Services, and you shall pay the Fees due upon receipt of such invoice. To the extent you procure the Services under an applicable Order Form, any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All Fees set forth in an applicable Order Form shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated therein. Fees are payable in United States dollars.

In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
6.3 Payment by Credit Card
. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
6.4 Payment Disputes

6.5 Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
. Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or canceling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full.

6.8 Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.

https://branch.io/pricing/
, or its successor URL (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Services, or any portion thereof.

6.2 Payments & Invoicing
. To the extent you procure the Services with an applicable Order Form(s), invoices for the applicable Fees shall be sent to you via email to the email address(es) you designate in your account when signing up for Services, and you shall pay the Fees due upon receipt of such invoice.

Taxes
").

6.8 Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.  You are prohibited from creating new accounts until the Fees due are paid in full.

. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
Payment Disputes
. If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
. Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
Taxes
. Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "
Taxes
"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
Withholding Taxes
. In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("
Withholding Tax
"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.
Term for Paid Services
. Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.
Termination by Branch
. Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable. Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the date Branch provides written notice to you of such violation. Termination by Branch for your violation of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured. Upon termination of the Agreement, any outstanding balance through the effective date of termination and other unpaid payment obligations will be immediately due and payable in full.

PAID SERVICE TERMS
Fees
. You will pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Agreement or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in the Agreement, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed up to the effective date of termination.
Payments & Invoicing
. Any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All charges shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form.

You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Payment by Credit Card
. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
Payment Disputes
. If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
. Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
Taxes
. Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "
Taxes
"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
Withholding Taxes
. In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("
Withholding Tax
"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.
Term for Paid Services

Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.
Termination by Branch
. Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable. Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the date Branch provides written notice to you of such violation. Termination by Branch for your violation of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured.

PAID SERVICE TERMS
Fees
. You will pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Agreement or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in the Agreement, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed up to the effective date of termination.
Payments & Invoicing
. Any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All charges shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from Your financial institution and intermediary banks. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.
Payment by Credit Card
. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.
Payment Disputes
. If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.
Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration
. Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.
Taxes
. Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "
Taxes
"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.
Withholding Taxes
. In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("
Withholding Tax
"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.
Overdue Charges
. If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.
Term for Paid Services
. Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.
Termination by Branch
. Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable. Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the date Branch provides written notice to you of such violation. Termination by Branch for your violation of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured. Upon termination of the Agreement, any outstanding balance through the effective date of termination and other unpaid payment obligations will be immediately due and payable in full.

Receiving Party
”) may have access to, or become acquainted with, certain non-public confidential information of the other party (a “
Disclosing Party

Permitted Disclosures

Branch, CCPA, and CPRA
On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) took effect. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) amendments to the CCPA become effective January 1, 2023. Building on the privacy foundation established through our GDPR compliance efforts, Branch is committed to ensuring that our services continue to comply with the CCPA.
We have created this CCPA resource page to help you understand the steps that Branch has taken regarding its own CCPA compliance, and the tools available to our customers to enable the use of Branch’s services in a CCPA-compliant way.
In this guide, we have capitalized terms
defined by the CCPA
, as amended by the CPRA, so you can easily identify them.
The role of Branch under the CCPA
How does the CCPA apply to the relationship between Branch and its customers?
If you are using Branch analytics and deep-linking services as a customer, there is an agreement between you and Branch that describes the services that Branch provides to you. This agreement may include order forms, exhibits, or addenda, and serves as your instruction to Branch to process personal data as part of Branch’s performance of our services. For the purposes of the CCPA, the data that Branch collects on behalf of its customers may include Personal Information.
When using our analytics and deep-linking services, if you are subject to the CCPA, you are a “Business” and Branch is your “Service Provider,” as those terms are defined in the CCPA. Your disclosure of Personal Information related to your end users with Branch, and Branch’s collection on your behalf of Personal Information related to your end users, are done to facilitate Branch’s performance of its services that you contracted for.
Branch Will Never Sell or Share Personal Information
As part of its provision of analytics and deep-linking services to you, Branch does not “Sell” or “Share” Personal Information of your end users as defined under the CCPA.
This Addendum supplements our agreement with you and confirms our commitment to not Sell or Share Personal Information as part of our analytics and deep-linking services.
How Branch supports CCPA compliance for our customers
CCPA Addendum
Branch has updated its terms to codify our position as your Service Provider (as defined by CCPA). We’ve made our California Privacy addendum available for review, which reflects our CCPA standards. This
California Privacy Addendum
supplements our agreement with you and confirms our commitment to not Sell or Share Personal Information in violation of the CCPA.
California Privacy Addendum
Handling Consumer Rights Requests
As a Business, it is your responsibility under the CCPA to respond to requests relating to the Personal Information of your end users, including end user requests to access, delete, or correct their Personal Information.
Verifiable Consumer Requests
As a Service Provider under the CCPA, Branch works with you when your end users contact you to exercise their rights under the CCPA to obtain access to, delete, or correct Personal Information.
Branch will follow your instructions to delete or rectify Personal Information as required under the law, unless Branch concludes that it is necessary for Branch to maintain such Personal Information for one or more permitted purposes under applicable law (e.g., to detect fraudulent or illegal activity, or to prosecute those responsible for these activities).

Your disclosure of Personal Information related to your end users with Branch, and Branch’s collection on your behalf of Personal Information related to your end users, are done to facilitate Branch’s performance of its services that you contracted for.

As part of its provision of analytics and deep-linking services to you, Branch does not “Sell” or “Share” Personal Information of your end users as defined under the CCPA.

The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months. Instead, we limit our sharing of information as set forth in the
“How does Branch Share Information?”

“Third-Party Tools / Analytics on the Website”

California Rights and Choices
Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect about you and to delete that information, subject to certain restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
Right to request access to your personal information
California residents have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, or sell. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. However, we may withhold some personal information as permitted under applicable law. For example, to protect your security, we may withhold your account password from the information provided in response to a request for the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.
Right to request deletion of your personal information
You may also request that we delete any personal information that we collected from you. However, we may retain personal information necessary to (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations. Additionally, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.
How to exercise your access and deletion rights
Subject to restrictions under applicable law, California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by
submitting your request
to us, or by contacting us at privacy@branch.io.
For security purposes, when you request to exercise your California privacy rights we will verify your identity. Once we have verified your identity
(and your agent, as applicable)
, we will respond to your request as appropriate:
Transparency.
Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will direct you to the sections of our Privacy Policy relevant to your request.
Access.
Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, except where not permitted under applicable law or otherwise exempted by the CCPA.
Deletion.
Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have collected from you, we will delete any information about you that is not necessary for the purposes indicated above. Upon completion, we will send you a notice confirming that we deleted the information we collected from you. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.
Right to nondiscrimination
We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.
Authorized Agents
You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf (e.g. through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney).
Submitting CCPA Requests

If you are a California Consumer, please
submit a CCPA request here

Contractual Commitments: We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, we will process your Personal Data to comply with our agreements with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.
With Your Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent.
Legitimate Interests: In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for the Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.

Although we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Data, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where it is commercially proprietary. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Data.

ONBOARDING SERVICE ASSUMPTIONS.
Unless otherwise noted in this SOW or agreed to in writing by the Parties, the following assumptions are based on information provided by the Customer relating to the Project and have been used to estimate Branch PS’s required time, level of effort, and fees. Deviations from these assumptions may lead to commensurate changes in the timeline and fees and will be handled through a formal Change Order.
Term Length:
Unless otherwise agreed upon by both Parties and executed in a Change Order, the obligation of Branch to provide Onboarding Services under this SOW expires after the timeframe identified in the Order Form, following the SOW “Effective Date.”
Reasonable Work Hours:
Customer agrees that (1) Branch PS staffing commitments (“Staffing Commitments”) include up to the amount set forth in the Order Form (if any); (2) Staffing Commitments in this SOW may not have been fully scoped, and there is no assurance that the work identified by the Customer for Branch PS subject to Staffing Commitments can be completed within the time period scoped or even that such work can be completed at all; (3) Branch PS reserves the right to reject any request for work identified by Customer to be provided by Branch PS as Staffing Commitments, if Branch PS reasonably believes such work is outside of the type of services normally provided by Branch PS; and (4) Staffing Commitments may be consumed by Branch PS in completing preparations for meetings, completing offline research, and completing offline configurations or other action items.
Overages:
Branch PS will secure Customer’s approval to bill against overages that exceed initial Staffing Commitments or arising from delays caused by Customer before the provisioning of any such overage services.
Cancellation / Postponement:
Branch PS and Customer will use commercially reasonable efforts to attend all scheduled Project meetings. The repeated cancellation of Project meetings may result in Project delay and additional costs.
CUSTOMER RESOURCE AVAILABILITY.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Branch PS team’s performance is contingent upon Customer’s timely performance of its obligations under this SOW. Project timeline estimates provided by Branch PS are dependent on the availability of Customer resources and key decision makers. Lack of access to, or any material change to, Customer’s resources and/or Project stakeholders may impact estimated timelines, costs, fees, and whether additional Onboarding Services may be needed. As such, Customer agrees to promptly: (a) acknowledge, review, and respond to communications from Branch PS to support and progress the Project; (b) sign or e-sign any documents necessary to enable integration features with third-party partners selected by Customer to enable Branch PS to continue the provisioning of the Onboarding Services; connect the Branch PS team with Customer’s relevant contacts and subject matter experts as may be necessary to facilitate the Onboarding Services. Should Customer choose not to go live with any aspect of the deployment, and then at a future date need additional Onboarding Services, this will require another statement of work or Change Order to extend the Onboarding Services term and may result in additional costs. Customer is solely responsible for its engagement with and management of any third-party vendors that Customer integrates into, or uses in conjunction with, Branch.
FEES.
Customer will pay Branch all fees for Onboarding Services in accordance with this SOW and at the rates specified in the applicable Order Form.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 18).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s Services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment. In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels, and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

As part of Branch’s Services, Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor) that have partnered with Branch to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf in connection with the measurement and analysis of the Client's marketing campaigns.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti- fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 18).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s Services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment. In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels, and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti- fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

We also require Clients to set up a user ID and unique password for account security purposes. Clients must not disclose their passwords to anyone. Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 18).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s Services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment. In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels, and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

As part of Branch’s Services, Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor) that have partnered with Branch to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf in connection with the measurement and analysis of the Client's marketing campaigns.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti- fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 18).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s Services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment. In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels, and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti- fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites.

Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

As part of Branch’s Services, Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor) that have partnered with Branch to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf in connection with the measurement and analysis of the Client's marketing campaigns.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We prohibit Clients from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process.
Clients are also required to inform us if they are using Branch’s services to analyze information protected by HIPAA so that Branch can process such information in a protected environment.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites.

Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”). Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Subject to Agreements with our Clients, data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
Where authorized by Agreements with our Clients, we may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
, Agreements, or other contracts with us. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
Branch is a deep linking and attribution analytics platform for app and website developers. We are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices ("Digital Properties")--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Branch and its Clients have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Branch and their use by Clients ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information processed in the Services. Nothing in this Privacy Policy derogates from such obligations.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their Digital Properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking,
which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.  For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
Branch collects data through various methods, including:
When the Client integrates Branch’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Digital Properties and/or ads;
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Client in connection with the measurement and analysis of Client’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Branch;
When provided voluntarily by the Client as part of the Branch account registration process;
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Branch Links, Pixels
,
and Similar Technologies
Top
Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”).
Since Clients have sole control over their Digital Properties and configuration of the Services, Clients are contractually prohibited from configuring the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information , unless otherwise agreed by Branch. If a Client has configured the Services to collect directly identifiable personal information, then Branch may receive and process such data. This includes, for example, a Client using an End User’s email address as a Client issued Developer ID.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data that Branch collects through the Services is processed to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, to perform anti-fraud protection analysis, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their Digital Properties to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect. We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data. No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "Branch", "us", "our" or "we") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "Clients")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("Users") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "Branch Services" or the "Services").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "
Branch
", "
us
", "
our
" or "
we
") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices

Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:

Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.

Engagement Builder:
Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.

We also require Clients to set up a user ID and unique password for account security purposes. Clients must not disclose their passwords to anyone. Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts. We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with promotional emails. We offer a mechanism to opt out from promotional emails as described in the “Opt-Out from Promotional Emails” section below.

Some Website Users may provide Personal Data to Branch by sending us an email or filling out an online form on the Website. We use this information to answer their question(s), and may store that information for our record keeping, marketing, and advertising purposes.
Research/Survey Solicitations:
From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage vendors to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities.

Our Data Retention Policy

For our Services:
Branch stores the information collected by our Services (see the “What Information Does Branch Collect from our Services?” section above) so long as our systems continue to encounter that User. After that User has been inactive for 30 days (or 90 days for specific attribution products), identifiers collected from that User will be deleted unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Usage activity logs, which are used for the purpose of reporting and analytics, are stored in an identifiable form for no more than 7 days (or up to 60 days as determined by the Client or for specific fields), after which these logs are removed or pseudonymized. Any and all pseudonymized logs are deleted after 12 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Aggregated reporting metrics disclosed to Clients are retained (in aggregate and anonymized form) for up to 24 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Branch may retain information collected by our Services beyond these periods for fraud prevention, analysis, or response, or to protect the safety of Branch, its Clients, Users or the public.

All information collected via the Website and Services is stored on servers located in the United States.

By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.
Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States

Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov
.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union, UK, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Branch at:
Branch Metrics, Inc.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "
Branch
", "
us
", "
our
" or "
we
") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit

.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "
Branch
", "
us
", "
our
" or "
we
") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Top
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:
Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking

. This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer read or set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself). Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

Client App Opt-out Controls:
Branch‘s
SDK Privacy Controls
allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
Engagement Builder:
Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.

.
Our Data Retention Policy
Top
For our Services:
Branch stores the information collected by our Services (see the “What Information Does Branch Collect from our Services?” section above) so long as our systems continue to encounter that User. After that User has been inactive for 30 days (or 90 days for specific attribution products), identifiers collected from that User will be deleted unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Usage activity logs, which are used for the purpose of reporting and analytics, are stored in an identifiable form for no more than 7 days (or up to 60 days as determined by the Client or for specific fields), after which these logs are removed or pseudonymized. Any and all pseudonymized logs are deleted after 12 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Aggregated reporting metrics disclosed to Clients are retained (in aggregate and anonymized form) for up to 24 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Branch may retain information collected by our Services beyond these periods for fraud prevention, analysis, or response, or to protect the safety of Branch, its Clients, Users or the public.
For the Website:
We store Personal Data such as email address or billing details for so long as you continue to have a business relationship with Branch and for a reasonable time thereafter for record-keeping purposes. If applicable to you, you may ask us to delete that information as described in the “Data Subject Rights” section below or pursuant to your right of erasure as described in the “Data Subject Rights” section below.
Links to Other Websites
Top
The Website and/or Services may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Website and/or Services. These other domains and websites are not controlled by Branch, and we do not endorse or make any representations about websites or social media platforms operated by other parties.

International Data Transfers
Top
All information collected via the Website and Services is stored on servers located in the United States. In the process of providing the Services, we may transfer information across borders from other countries or jurisdictions into the United States. Data protection laws in the United States may differ from your country, and the data Branch processes may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.
Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States
Top
Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this    summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or            websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch        customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s        end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can        request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end        user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated    above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed    to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so    that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. (
"Branch"
,
"us"
,
"our"
or
"we"
) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of    devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to    derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes    and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our    services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This        section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website        located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the        parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information    we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way    that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of    Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a    wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions    across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so    that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the    Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to    provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are    provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links,    pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using    the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution    techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these    attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform,    creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and    identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data    parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well    as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases,    these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users    with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s        connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a                specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download                the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics        metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client        directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that                downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific                link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a                tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have                interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

Information Collected By Other Parties
Top
As part of Branch’s Services,    Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor)    to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services        we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new        products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our        Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure        more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by        law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the    data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject    to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to    understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Top
Branch recognizes a number of    consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no    longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:
Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by    clicking
here
. This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where    Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer read or set cookies (beyond    the opt-out cookie itself). Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that    you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt    out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with    the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by    participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available
here
.
Device-Based Opt-Out:
You can submit a request to opt out of the Branch Services on    a particular device by submitting a request
here
.
Device Identifiers:
To use your device’s privacy settings controls, please visit the    privacy settings menu of your device to review and access the privacy controls made available on the    device. Branch will only be able to collect information from the device as permitted by these    settings.
Client App Opt-out Controls:
Branch‘s
SDK Privacy Controls
allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data.    Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch,    in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
Engagement Builder:
Branch's Engagement Builder feature    may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using    Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by    Branch.

Help us improve                        your experience on the account dashboard
When a Client creates an account and uses the Services, Branch may collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Client is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g., browser type and version, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Client (“Log Data”).
We also require Clients to set up a user ID and unique password for account security purposes. Clients must not disclose their passwords to anyone. Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts. We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with promotional emails. We offer a mechanism to opt out from promotional emails as described in the “Opt-Out from Promotional Emails” section below.
Account and Billing Information:
To the extent that we charge a fee for the Services, we may also collect limited billing, payment, and contract information from Clients through our payment and contract vendors.
Connection Information with Other Parties:
Some features of the dashboard Services allow you to disclose your information through your accounts to other companies such as Facebook and Google. If you choose to connect Branch to such services provided by other parties, we may collect information related to your use of those services provided by other parties, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your accounts with those other parties. We will ask you for permission before you authorize our collection of this information. We may also collect information about how you are using the Services to interact with those connected services.
Information from Other Sources:
In addition to the information collected through our Website, we or our vendors may obtain and disclose additional information, such as job title or contact information, from other public and non-public sources such as business websites, social networking platforms, or databases maintained by other parties.

Some Website Users may provide Personal Data to Branch    by sending us an email or filling out an online form on the Website. We use this information to    answer their question(s), and may store that information for our record keeping, marketing, and    advertising purposes.
Research/Survey Solicitations:
From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage vendors to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities.

Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S.    Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of    Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries    (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the    United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union    ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as    the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European    Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield    inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with    respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If    there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy    Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield    program, and to view our certification page, please visit

.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer    data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of    the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform    EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be    required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to    meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access    their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to    exercise this right may do so by contacting
privacy@branch.io
.

Privacy Policy
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell customer end user data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. (
"Branch"
,
"us"
,
"our"
or
"we"
) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “
Website
”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to recognize browsers and devices that are likely to be operated by the same User.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Top
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:

Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

SDK Privacy Controls
allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
Engagement Builder:
Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.

Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts. We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with promotional emails. We offer a mechanism to opt out from promotional emails as described in the “Opt-Out from Promotional Emails” section below.

To the extent that we charge a fee for the Services, we may also collect limited billing, payment, and contract information from Clients through our payment and contract vendors.

Communications with Branch:
Some Website Users may provide Personal Data to Branch by sending us an email or filling out an online form on the Website. We use this information to answer their question(s), and may store that information for our record keeping, marketing, and advertising purposes.
Research/Survey Solicitations:
From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage vendors to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities.

Usage activity logs, which are used for the purpose of reporting and analytics, are stored in an identifiable form for no more than 7 days (or up to 60 days as determined by the Client or for specific fields), after which these logs are removed or pseudonymized. Any and all pseudonymized logs are deleted after 12 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.
Aggregated reporting metrics disclosed to Clients are retained (in aggregate and anonymized form) for up to 24 months, unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.

By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.

Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov
.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to other parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting
privacy@branch.io
.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
Top
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. You’ll find our official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from sharing with Branch any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Our customers can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell personal data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with GDPR requirements as well.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Top
Branch Metrics, Inc. (
"Branch"
,
"us"
,
"our"
or
"we"
) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from service providers and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Top
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Top
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to share with Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Top
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to infer that certain browsers and devices are operated by the same User based upon connections Branch has derived across non-affiliated apps and websites.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or third parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and share these reports with the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Top
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit visit

Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to agent third parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.

Privacy Policy
Last updated February 3, 2022
The Branch Guiding Privacy Principles
We are a linking and analytics platform for app and website developers. And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. You’ll find our official
Privacy Policy
below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.
We limit the data we collect.
We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs. Nor do we want to. In fact, our
Terms & Conditions
prohibit our customers from sharing with Branch any kind of sensitive end-user information.
We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites.
Our customers can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.
We do not rent or sell personal data.
No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion
here
of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with GDPR requirements as well.
Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.
Introduction
Branch Metrics, Inc. (
"Branch"
,
"us"
,
"our"
or
"we"
) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "
Clients
")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("
Users
") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:
This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our products and services (the "
Branch Services
" or the "
Services
").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:
This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from service providers and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:
This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Branch Services: Overview
Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:
To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.
Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to share with Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.

Information Collected By Third Parties
As part of Branch’s Services, Branch’s Clients may direct certain of their vendors or business partners (such as an ad network or vendor) to provide certain Engagement Data to Branch on the Client’s behalf.
How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Data Branch collects through the Services is processed:
to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to infer that certain browsers and devices are operated by the same User based upon connections Branch has derived across non-affiliated apps and websites.
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or third parties.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and share these reports with the public.
for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our
Terms & Conditions
. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Choices
Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.
Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out:
Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking

Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.
NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out:
Branch is a member of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available

Our Data Retention Policy
For our Services:
Branch stores the information collected by our Services (see the “What Information Does Branch Collect from our Services?” section above) so long as our systems continue to encounter that User. After that User has been inactive for 30 days (or 90 days for specific attribution products), identifiers collected from that User will be deleted unless otherwise required by applicable law or otherwise agreed between Branch and the Client.

International Data Transfers
All information collected via the Website and Services is stored on servers located in the United States. In the process of providing the Services, we may transfer information across borders from other countries or jurisdictions into the United States. By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.
Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States
Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov
.
Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.
Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to agent third parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.
We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union, UK, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Branch at:
Branch Metrics, Inc.
195 Page Mill Road, Suite 101
Palo Alto, CA 94306
or by email at privacy@branch.io
Branch has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers

Supplier Code of Conduct
Introduction
This Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”) has been established to summarize Branch's  core values and expected standards of conduct for its vendors, contractors, consulting firms, staffing agencies, agency temps, partners, licensees and other intermediaries and their respective employees and affiliates (collectively, “Suppliers” or “you”) to comply with when working with Branch. All Suppliers shall promote a safe, diverse, lawful and respectful work environment. We believe that this Supplier Code will reinforce those qualities and attributes that have made both Branch and you successful.
Suppliers are expected to review, understand and comply with the policies set forth in this Supplier Code. The Supplier Code should be viewed as the minimum standards that we expect and is not intended in any way to lessen your contractual obligations with Branch. Failure to comply with this Supplier Code may result in Branch’s review of its engagement with a Supplier and may result in termination of Supplier’s relationship with Branch.
This Supplier Code and all policies contained herein will be administered in accordance with applicable law and may be updated from time to time. If you have questions about this Supplier Code, you can contact Branch at
legal@branch.io
.
Compliance with Rules, Laws, and Regulations
Suppliers are expected to comply with all applicable rules, laws, and regulations at all times while working with Branch. You have a responsibility to be knowledgeable about specific laws and regulations that apply to your area of business. If a law conflicts with this Supplier Code, you must comply with the law.
Diversity and
Non-Discrimination
Diversity is at the forefront of Branch’s mission and culture. We are and remain committed to being a globally diverse, ethical, moral and inclusive company that is tolerant of all individuals from all different backgrounds because we believe the best ideas come from a diverse way of looking at technology and the world.
Accordingly, Suppliers shall provide an environment free from unlawful discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics, such as age, race, religion, national origin, caste, ancestry, disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, pregnancy, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other basis protected by applicable law. Additionally, we expect all Suppliers to promote working environments where all individuals are entitled to equal opportunities and fair treatment.
Anti-Harassment
Each Supplier shall ensure its workplace is free of harassment. Harassment means any verbal, physical, and visual conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile working environment or that interferes with an individual’s work performance. Harassing conduct can take many forms and may include, but is not limited to, the following: slurs, jokes, statements, gestures, assault, impeding or blocking another’s movement or otherwise physically interfering with normal work, or sharing inappropriate materials.
Non-Retaliation
No Supplier will retaliate against an individual for filing a good faith complaint of unlawful discrimination or harassment or for participating in any good faith investigation of alleged discrimination or harassment.
Conflicts of Interest
Branch expects all Suppliers to avoid conflicts of interest and to operate with the highest level of ethics and integrity. A potential conflict of interest, or the appearance of one, occurs when your outside interests (for example, financial or personal interests) interfere with or influence, or even just appear to interfere with or influence, yours or Branch’s business interests or your work-related duties.
Suppliers may give and accept common courtesy items that are of modest cost, provided for legitimate business purposes and are understood as customary in Supplier’s industry. However, Suppliers must refrain from giving or accepting any gifts or other items with an intent to influence Branch, its customers, prospects, agents, employees or representatives or to obtain an improper business advantage, or in exchange for favors or benefits.
Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery
Branch Supplier's are strictly prohibited from partaking in any and all forms of corruption and bribery, including, but not limited to, payment or receipt of bribes or kickbacks to or from foreign or domestic government employees or officials, representatives of commercial enterprises or any other persons, whether made directly or through others such as agents, consultants or other associated parties. Suppliers will take all necessary steps to ensure that corruption and bribery do not occur in its business activities, wherever those business activities may take place. Violations of this nature may result in the termination of Supplier's partnership with Branch and may also lead to civil and criminal penalties.
Suppliers will also ensure their compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other applicable laws that prohibit unlawful activities to procure a business advantage.
Antitrust
Suppliers shall refrain from engaging in any and all acts which are or may be considered counter to antitrust and fair competition legislation and regulations. Additionally, Branch expects its Suppliers to promote a free, open and competitive marketplace by avoiding all forms of anti-competitive acts or collusion. Suppliers’ responsibilities under this section shall apply wherever a Supplier conducts business.
Confidential Information, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property
Our customers, partners and employees entrust us to safeguard their confidential information with the utmost security. As follows, Branch expects all of its Suppliers to protect confidential information and trade secrets regarding Branch and its business practices. Branch confidential information should only be used in accordance with existing confidentiality obligations for authorized purposes, disclosed on a need-to-know basis, and subject to separate written confidentiality obligations. Similarly, intellectual property including, but not limited to trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, logos, and other inventions, belonging to Branch, shall be handled with the appropriate level of care and preserved to the extent legally permissible. We encourage all Suppliers to regularly review their confidentiality practices.
In the event Supplier controls or processes personal information and/or personal data as defined under applicable data protection laws, Suppliers must ensure that their control and processing of such information and data is in accordance with applicable data protection laws, rules, statutes, and regulations. Suppliers are expected to maintain a privacy policy describing its privacy practices and handling of personal information.
Healthy Workplace and Labor Practices
Branch Suppliers must provide all employees with safe and healthy workplace conditions that comply with all applicable laws.
Suppliers will also refrain from engaging or attempting to engage in any and all forms of child labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking in violation of all applicable laws.
Environmental Protection
Branch Suppliers shall conduct their business and operations in such a manner that is respectful, responsible and protective of the environment. At a minimum, Suppliers shall comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and standards. Whenever possible, Branch encourages its Suppliers to continually review their internal operations in order to reduce waste, promote clean air initiatives, and conserve resources.
International Trade and Export Controls
Branch expects Suppliers to comply with all applicable import, export, customs, sanctions, embargoes, boycott and other trade compliance laws and regulations during the entirety of Branch and Supplier’s engagement.
Accurate and Complete Books and Records
All Suppliers must maintain accurate records of all transactions and ensure that the Supplier’s books and records accurately and fairly reflect, with appropriate detail, all transactions, expenses, or other dispositions of assets with regard to its business with Branch. No Supplier employee or other worker shall falsify or otherwise mislead Branch with regard to any records or books Supplier maintains.
Reporting Breaches of this Policy
Compliance with this Supplier Code is, first and foremost, the personal responsibility of Suppliers, including every individual employed by Supplier. All personnel are encouraged to report, in person or in writing, any known or suspected violations of this Supplier Code to Branch at
legal@branch.io
. Any questions or violation reports will be addressed promptly.
Branch will not tolerate any retaliation by Supplier against any individual who acts in good faith in reporting any violation of this Supplier Code. Supplier will investigate reported violations and will determine an appropriate response, including corrective action and preventive measures, and will include Branch in this process at its request.
