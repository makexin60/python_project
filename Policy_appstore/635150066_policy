Minors
Hilton does not knowingly collect, disclose, or sell personal information of individuals under the age of majority in their respective jurisdiction without permission from a minor’s parent or guardian. When searching for hotel reservations on a Hilton website or on the Hilton Honors app, you may be asked to provide the ages of any minor guests staying in the room. Hilton collects this information for the purpose of determining room rates where applicable, such as at an “all-inclusive” property.
Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)
We use closed circuit television and other security measures at our properties that may capture or record images of guests and visitors in public areas, as well as information related to your location while on our properties (via keycards and other technologies) for the protection of our staff, guests, and visitors to our properties. We retain CCTV in accordance with our data retention policies, as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which that information was collected, or as required or permitted by law. You may be able to request access to CCTV images within the time specified by applicable law and as required by law.
Franchised hotels are operated by entities that are separate from Hilton. To request access to CCTV images from a franchised hotel, please contact that hotel. In addition to Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc., those entities also are independent data controllers of CCTV images. When permitted by law, we may charge an appropriate fee to cover the costs of responding to the request. Such requests may be submitted by accessing the Data Subject Rights Requests Portal at
datarights.hilton.com
or in writing to
DataProtectionOffice@hilton.com
or Hilton Data Protection Officer, 7930 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, VA 22102, USA.

Cookies and Other Technologies
Like many other websites, our site may use "Cookies" or "Other Technologies" (such as "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," links in emails, JavaScript, device IDs assigned by Google or Apple, or similar technologies). Cookies and Other Technologies allow us and third parties to obtain information about your visits to the site, including to analyze your visiting patterns. We use this information to process your reservations or requests and to deliver online and mobile advertisements, messages and content for us and others that are specific to your interests. Depending on your jurisdiction, prior consent for the use of non-essential Cookies may be required. If it is the case, we will obtain your consent before using Cookies on your device.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device ("device") when you visit a website. Cookies alone cannot be used to disclose your individual identity to us, though in some cases we may tie Hilton or third-party Cookies to personal information you have provided to us or that we have otherwise obtained about you. Cookies may be used on the site in order to improve your experience. For example, we will use Cookies to:
Remember your user name and password for future visits so that log-in is easier and faster;
Remember your language and other preferences;
Ensure you obtain all requested information;
Provide a safe and secure service for online transactions;
Track your response to advertisements and website or app content for analysis and the number of times we send you the same advertisement; Measure how many people use the site, and how they use it, so that we may keep it running quickly and efficiently; and
Help us and others deliver communications and content to you that are relevant and responsive to your interests and location.
Below we explain the different types of Cookies that may be used on the site.
Essential Cookies – Essential Cookies are necessary for the site to work, and enable you to move around it and use its services and features. Disabling these Cookies may make the services and features unavailable.
Functional Cookies – We use Functional Cookies to save your settings on the site—settings such as your language preference, or booking information you have previously used when booking a hotel with us. We also use Functional Cookies to store such things as the last hotel you searched for, so that you can easily find it the next time you visit. Some Functional Cookies are essential to viewing maps or videos on our site.
Session Cookies – These types of Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session, and are deleted from your device when you close the browser. We use Session Cookies to support the functionality of the site and to understand your use of the site—that is, which pages you visit, which links you use and how long you stay on each page.
Persistent Cookies – These types of Cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, but are saved on your device for a fixed period of time or until you delete them. Each time you visit the site, the server that set the Cookie will recognize the persistent Cookie saved on your device. We and others use persistent Cookies to store your preferences, so that they are available for your next visit, to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit the site, how often you return, how your use of the site may vary over time and the effectiveness of advertising efforts.
Advertising Cookies – Allow us and other advertisers to show you the most relevant products, offers, and advertisements on the site and third-party sites, or through emails or other message platforms. For example, some Advertising Cookies help our service providers and other advertisers select advertisements that are based on your interests, including those expressed or inferred by visits to our websites or apps or across other websites, online services, and apps over time. Others help prevent the same advertisement from continuously reappearing for you. These types of Cookies also help us provide you with content on the site that is tailored to your interests and needs. As noted below, some Analytics Cookies and Other Technologies are used in part to facilitate advertising.
Social Plug-In Cookies – Advertising Cookies also include Social Plug-In Cookies. Social Plug-In Cookies are used to share content from the site with members and non-members of social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Pinterest. These Cookies are usually set by the social networking provider, enabling such sharing to be smooth and seamless.
Analytics Cookies – Collect information about your use of the site, and enable us to improve the way it works. These Cookies give us aggregated information that we use to monitor site performance, count page visits, spot technical errors, see how users reach the site, and measure the effectiveness of advertising (including emails we send to you).
Other technologies may be used for the same purposes as our Cookies, to allow us and third parties to know when you visit the site, and to understand how you interact with emails or advertisements. Through Other Technologies, non-personal information (e.g., your operating system, your browser version, and the URL you came from) or aggregate information may be obtained and used to enhance your experience and understand traffic patterns.
MANAGING COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

Analytics and Interest-Based Advertisements
We partner with certain third-party service providers to collect information to engage in analytics, auditing, research, and reporting.  These third parties may use server logs, web beacons, tags, pixels, and similar technologies, and they may set and access Cookies on your computer or other device.
In particular, we use Adobe Analytics to help us understand how our customers use our websites. We also use Adobe Audience Manager to create audiences for personalizing content and advertising experiences. Read more about
how Adobe uses your Personal Information
in web browsers by Adobe Analytics.
We partner with Amazon Chat which supports our chat platform. We may use Amazon Chat for sharing dynamic content for authenticated users.
We use WhatsApp to help us send you personalized content and advertising experiences across multiple platforms. We may use WhatsApp for analytics, research, and reporting. We will use your WhatsApp phone number to link you to your existing Hilton account (if available) and leverage your data to enhance our analytics, providing you with a richer customer experience across all channels.

We partner with third parties to provide advertising services that are targeted based on your online activities across websites, mobile apps, and devices over time (commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising”). Our advertising partners may collect information about your activities on our Services on your current device and combine it with information about your activities on other websites, mobile apps, and devices. They may collect such information using server logs, cookies, web beacons, tags, pixels, mobile advertising IDs (such as Facebook cookies or Google's Advertising ID), cross-device linking, and similar technologies. For example, our advertising partners may use the fact that you visited our website to target advertising to you on other websites and mobile apps on your current device or on other devices you use. They may match your browsers or devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household. This means that information about your activity on websites or apps on your current browser or device may be combined and used with information collected from your other browsers or devices. You can opt out of interest-based advertising in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by following the instructions below.
For more information about interest-based advertising and cross-device linking, please visit the
Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) website
and the
Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website
. We adhere to the DAA's interest-based advertising principles by providing you enhanced notice, transparency, and control of our digital marketing practices as stated at
http://www.aboutads.info/principles/
. You may opt out of interest-based advertising and cross-device linking in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by following the instructions below.
Web Browser Opt-Out.

downloading the app
and following the instructions. For more information about opting out on mobile devices, please see

Please note that the opt-outs described above will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out, and therefore you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile advertising identifiers, change browsers (including upgrading certain browsers), or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work, and you will need to opt out again.

How We Protect Personal Information
We take reasonable measures to: (i) protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, and (ii) keep personal information accurate and up-to-date as appropriate.
Hilton employs a robust team of dedicated information security professionals who are responsible for managing Hilton's security program. This team is responsible for, among many other things, monitoring our systems for potential intrusions, responding to potential incidents, supporting property-level information security, regularly reviewing and updating the security controls Hilton uses to protect data, and providing training on Hilton's information security program.
Hilton maintains a payment card industry (“PCI”) compliance program and an Information Technology compliance program. This compliance program generates audit reports concerning the adequacy and effectiveness of Hilton's Technology internal controls, including a PCI Attestation of Compliance signed by an external PCI Qualified Security Assessor and a SSAE16/SOC1 report addressing the Technology general controls over systems that support certain accounting and financial reporting.
We require third parties with whom we share personal information to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of personal information.
We will never ask you to send us confidential personal information or payment card information via email or text message.
In the event of a security incident, Hilton will notify regulators and/or consumers as required by applicable laws and regulations.

Disclosure Pursuant to Legal Obligations or to Protect the Safety and Security of People and Property
Hilton will disclose personal information as required by law. Examples of such disclosures include when countries require Hilton to collect personal data about visitors to properties in that country, when a law enforcement agency serves a valid subpoena on Hilton, and when a civil litigant serves a lawful discovery request on Hilton. Hilton may elect to share personal information with law enforcement, employers, those who host events with Hilton, or others as necessary to protect the safety and security of people and property, to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain, and to respond to an emergency.
