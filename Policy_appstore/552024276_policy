At Betfair UKI, we take the protection of our customers` personal data and privacy very seriously, and we never lose sight of the fact that your personal data is
YOUR

We believe in using your personal data to make things simpler and better for you, and we will always keep your personal data safe using the highest standards of security.We`ll be clear and open with you about why we collect your personal data and how we use it, and where you have choices or rights, we`ll explain them to you and respect your wishes.
What`s more, we manage customer personal data in a tightly controlled way to ensure we deliver our products in a safe and reliable fashion, to do all we can to proactively protect our customers from harm, and to ensure our business meets its legal and regulatory obligations and is protected against attack, crime or other potential risks.
1.2.2. Our key privacy and data protection principles
To meet these commitments, we employ the following 5 principles at Betfair UKI. These principles are at the heart of everything we do and ensure that your rights are considered at every step.
Keeping your data secure:
We recognise that online security and data protection is an area of vital importance for all our customers, so it is important to us that you have confidence in the security of your personal details before you register an account. We are committed to employing best-in-class security measures to protect your information and our technological security solutions are governed by a mature framework.
Data protection by design and default:
We are committed to implementing technical and organisational measures, at the earliest stages of the design of our Services, in such a way that safeguards your privacy and data protection rights from the start (data protection by design`). By default, we ensure that personal data is processed with the highest levels of privacy protection and that data is made accessible only to those who need it (data protection by default`). We also routinely use pseudonymisation and encryption when processing your data internally and where data is shared externally.

Our Privacy Statement provides you with everything you need to know about how your information will be used by Betfair UKI, and we embed ad-hoc privacy notices when you are using our sites to let you know when we might be using data in ways you don`t expect.

Where you have rights in respect of the data we process relating to you, we will do everything we can to make it easy to exercise these choices. We also endeavour to give you real choice over how you hear from us, and how we use cookies and other technologies.

Privacy Notice
Overview
Below you will find our Privacy Policy which tells you about how we will process your personal data and about rights that you have under data protection. We strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with this Privacy Policy. However, we understand that people have busy lives and so want to provide you with a quick overview of how we will use your personal data – please remember though that this first section is an overview only and should not be read instead of reading the full Privacy Policy below.
We process your personal data for the purposes discussed in detail below, but the two main purposes are to enable us to provide you with services and to comply with our regulatory obligations, specifically:
On the first of these, in order for us to offer you with services we will need you to register a user account and provide bank details to deposit money.
On the regulatory aspect, we are required to monitor our customers and to keep records of transactions to ensure that we are offering a fair, responsible and safe service – and this includes verifying your age and monitoring our customers to ensure that they are gambling within their means.
Introduction
