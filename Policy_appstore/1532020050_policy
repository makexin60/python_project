We choose our processors very carefully. We do not work with processors based in countries where we are concerned about the rule of law with respect to privacy.
We have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with all non-EEA third parties whose data processing tools we use (data processors) if there is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for their particular country. We adhere to the principles of minimization and anonymization, where feasible, to ensure compliance with the GDPR and other relevant data privacy laws when transferring personal data, if necessary.
By providing your personal data, you explicitly consent to its transfer, storage, or processing outside the EU. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that this information is handled securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Your personal data is safeguarded by the password you create when registering on our Platforms. It’s essential to choose a strong password and keep it confidential to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, refrain from sharing your password and ensure the security of your computer or mobile device.
We have instituted reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. For instance:
We utilize SSL encryption (HTTPS) for all interactions involving personal data.
Our databases are encrypted, and we store data on physically secure servers protected by firewalls.
In the event of a personal data breach as defined in Article 4.12 of the GDPR, we will promptly notify you. This notification will include relevant details, measures taken, and an assessment of associated risks, as required by applicable law and our Privacy Policy. We are committed to addressing breaches promptly and transparently, taking necessary actions such as logging affected users out, initiating password resets, and other appropriate measures to mitigate the breach.
