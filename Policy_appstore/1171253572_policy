A full list of such adequate countries is available
here
(for the EEA) and

12. Data retention
We retain data for as long as necessary to provide our Services and in accordance with our internal Data Retention Policy. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. We may delete (or anonymise) your Personal Data once this data is no longer needed for us to provide our Services to you, and this data will not be retrievable in the future once deleted.
You can delete some data whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time.
For example:
We keep account information for as long as your subscription or agreement continues or for as long as it is necessary to deliver our Services.
We will keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing, so that we can respect your request in future. If you unsubscribe from receiving direct marketing, then we will remove your details from our direct marketing mailing list.
We will keep the usage information and analytics data relating to your use of the Services to understand how people use our Services. We will do this through the use of cookies and tracking technologies to provide us with user analytics data to improve our Services and enhance your user experience. More information about the retention period of cookies can be found in our
Cookie Policy
.
Sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, and for an extended period of time. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include security, fraud prevention, financial record-keeping, complying with legal or regulatory requirements, ensuring the continuity of our Services, and when you have had direct communications with us.
13. Your rights and choices
You have the right to access your Personal Data, or to correct, delete or restrict processing of your Personal Data. You can also obtain the Personal Data you provide to us on a contractual basis or with your consent, in a structured, machine-readable format.
To exercise your data deletion rights (or “your right to be forgotten”) and request full deletion of your data from our Services, you must reach out to us directly by submitting a support ticket
here
or emailing us at
privacy@employmenthero.com
. You can also correct and delete some Personal Data through your account provided by our Services. Where your Personal Data has been provided to us by a third party acting in the capacity of a data controller (such as your employer), you must ask that third party to correct or delete your Personal Data on your behalf. This third party will then request us to correct or delete the Personal Data from our systems.
You can also object to the processing of your Personal Data in some circumstances where it is practicable to do so, i.e., when we are using the data for direct marketing.
These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal Personal Data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.
To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us using the details set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.
For the provision of information marked as mandatory when you register to use our Service, if such information is not provided, then you will not be able to use our Services. All other provision of your information is optional. If you do not provide such information, our provision of certain Services to you may be detracted from.
Where we rely on your consent, such as in relation to direct marketing communications, you will always be able to withdraw that consent at any time.
If you withdraw your consent to our processing of your data, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place.
