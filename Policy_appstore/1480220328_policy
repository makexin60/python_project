Privacy policy
Your privacy matters to us. At Tiimo A/S ("Tiimo," "we," "us," or "our"), we’re committed to protecting your personal information and handling it responsibly. This policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and your rights under GDPR.
Got questions? Reach out to us anytime at
hello@tiimo.dk
.
Who we are
We’re Tiimo A/S, a Danish company dedicated to creating the best possible digital planning tool to help you organize your life. We’re responsible for keeping your personal data secure and ensuring it’s processed in line with GDPR.
We work with trusted third-party providers (like payment processors and IT services) to help us deliver Tiimo smoothly. When we share your data with them, we make sure they handle it with the same care and legal compliance we do.
What data we collect
We only collect what’s necessary to provide and improve our services. Here’s what we may collect:
Information you provide
Name
Email address
Subscription details
Payment data
We work with third-party payment processors (like App Store and Google Play) to handle your payments. Depending on your location and payment method, we may collect payment-related data to manage your subscription. We do not store your full payment details, and all payment transactions are handled securely by our payment partners.
Automatically collected data
When you use our app or website, we may automatically collect:
Device information (e.g., device type, operating system)
IP address
Approximate location (based on your IP address)
Usage data (e.g., how you interact with the app/website)
If the app crashes, we may collect technical details to fix the issue. This data isn’t linked to you personally.
Why we collect your data
We collect your data to:
Provide and improve Tiimo’s services
Manage your subscription and payments
Communicate updates and features
Ensure the security and stability of our platform
We’ll never use your data for unrelated purposes without your consent.
Data Sharing
We do
not sell
your personal data.
However, we may share your data with trusted third-party providers who help us deliver and improve Tiimo. These providers process your data on our behalf and are required to comply with GDPR and keep your data safe.
We may share data with:
Payment processors to manage subscriptions and payments
IT and hosting providers to ensure Tiimo runs smoothly
Analytics services to understand how users engage with Tiimo and improve our service
In some cases, your data may be processed outside the EU/EEA. When this happens, we ensure your data is protected by:
Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission
Other equivalent safeguards in compliance with GDPR
We only share the minimum amount of data necessary with these providers to perform their tasks.
Children's privacy
Tiimo is designed to support individuals and families, and we take protecting children’s personal information seriously.
If a child under 13 years of age uses Tiimo, their account must be created by a parent or legal guardian. We rely on the parent or guardian to provide consent for processing the child’s data and to supervise their use of the app.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without parental consent. If we become aware that a child has provided personal information without a parent or guardian’s consent, we will delete that information promptly.
How we keep your data safe
We take security seriously and use industry-standard measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. These measures include encryption, firewalls, and access controls.
However, no system is 100% secure, so we encourage users to protect their accounts by keeping login details private. By using Tiimo, you acknowledge the risks associated with transmitting data online.
Legal basis for processing
We process your personal data based on:
Your agreement to use Tiimo when you sign up
Our legal obligations to protect your data
Our legitimate interest in improving Tiimo, as long as it doesn’t override your rights
Who can access your data?
We don’t sell your personal data to anyone. However, we do share your data with trusted third-party providers to keep Tiimo running smoothly.
