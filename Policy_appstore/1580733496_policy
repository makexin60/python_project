In order to deliver our services to you as a private individual (contract fulfilment)

In order to conduct video surveillance for the purpose of preventing and deterring criminal activity (balancing of interests) For more information about this, see the section below on video surveillance.
We retain personal data in accordance with the retention periods set out in Aimo Park’s data retention policy. Contact us via our email address below for privacy matters if you would like any more information in regards to this or any other information about our personal data processing.
Sharing of your personal data
We may share your personal data with:
Suppliers who carry out work on our behalf. If these suppliers act as Aimo Park’s personal data processors, then a separate data processing agreement is concluded.
Third parties where this is required under the law or as the result of a legal process or obligation. Such parties may include the police, the Swedish Transport Agency, the tax authorities or other government authorities. Camera images may be shared with the police and prosecutors in connection with criminal investigations.
In exceptional circumstances, personal data may also be shared with property owners/housing associations to comply with our agreements with such parties.
We may also collect information from the Swedish Transport Agency in connection with fine processing.
Video surveillance:
This section refers to traditional video surveillance at Aimo Park’s facilities and the automatic recording of vehicle number plates. For information about Aimo Park’s use of body cameras, please refer to our
Privacy Policy for Body Cameras here.
We use video surveillance to prevent theft and vandalism, to prevent and deter violence, to offer optimal levels of service and to support our operational procedures
Video surveillance may also be in use at certain parking facilities in the form of a simplified payment solution known as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) which uses cameras to read vehicle registration plates. Data processed in connection with video surveillance includes registration numbers and other image captures which can be attributed to a natural person. We retain data from video surveillance for up to two months unless, in exceptional circumstances, we need to keep the data for longer than this in order to protect our legal interests. For example, this might be the case if a crime has been committed and the material is needed in connection with a police/prosecutor investigation.
Specific procedure for accessing camera images:
Camera images represent personal data for which we are the recipient and which we protect with extra care. Video surveillance footage is covered by a confidentiality obligation and protected by established procedures to prevent unauthorised access or use.
We may disclose the footage to law enforcement authorities or other authorities if required to do so by law or to protect our interests – for example, in connection with an insurance case. If you wish to access camera images, we ask that you complete a form to request access to camera images. We will ask a number of questions about the information shown on the images and the appearance of the individual data subject. This is because there may be others who appear in the footage and this enables us to anonymise those people.
Regarding body cameras
Aimo Park’s parking attendants wear body cameras within certain areas. For more information on this form of personal data processing, please refer to our
Privacy Policy for Body Cameras here.

Sub-policy 1
https://www.aimopark.se/om-aimo-park/om-webbplatsen/integritetspolicy/integritetspolicy-for-kroppskameror/:
Integritetspolicy för kroppskameror
Aimos bevakningspersonal utsätts ofta för våld eller hot om våld. Vissa av Aimos parkeringsvakter är därför utrustade med kroppsburna kameror. Aimo har genomfört en riskbedömning avseende användningen av kroppskameror.
Var bär parkeringsvakterna kroppsburna kameror?
Inom de nedan listade områdena kan kroppsburna kameror förekomma på all allmän gatumark:
• Arvika
• Karlskrona
• Växjö
• Kristianstad
Det framgår i samtliga fall på en sticker fäst på parkeringsvakternas tjänstefordon om kroppsburna kameror förekommer inom det område som patrulleras. Kamerainspelning förekommer inte alltid inom områdena, utan enbart när parkeringsvakterna patrullerar desamma.
Behandlingens art, omfattning, sammanhang och ändamål
Aimo Park Sweden AB, org. nr. 556553-5548 (”
Aimo
”) är personuppgiftsansvarig för behandlingen av personuppgifterna som samlas in genom parkeringsvakternas kroppskameror.
Aimos bevakningspersonal utsätts regelbundet för hot och våld när de genomför sina uppdrag. Personalens uppdrag består i av parkeringsövervakning av fordon och att utfärda kontrollavgifter och parkeringsanmärkningar.
För att minska förekomsten av våld har Aimo utrustat viss personal med kroppsburna kameror. Aimo har noggrant övervägt denna aktivitet i förhållande till de registrerades rättigheter, framförallt de som kan komma att filmas, och har med bakgrund i statistik från personalens incidentrapportering funnit att kroppsburna kameror ökar personalens trygghet.
Vilka personuppgifter behandlas och hur går det till?
Rörliga bilder och ljudupptagning spelas kontinuerligt in av kroppskamerorna genom s.k. förinspelningsteknik. Inspelningarna raderas löpande med en intervall om tio sekunder. Detta innebär att inspelat material utöver detta enbart sparas om en parkeringsvakt aktiverar inspelningsfunktionen i en hotfull situation varpå inspelningen framåt samt en period om tio sekunder dessförinnan sparas. De tio sekunderna innan aktivering saknar dock ljudupptagning i syfte att begränsa den aktuella personuppgiftsbehandlingen.
Vilka individer kan förekomma på det inspelade materialet?
Personuppgiftsbehandlingen sker automatiskt genom s.k. förinspelningsteknik, som beskrivet ovan. Omfattningen av personuppgiftsbehandlingen kan bli stor när parkeringsvakterna patrullerar välbesökta områden, såsom allmänna gator. De individer som rör sig på dessa områden kan komma att filmas genom detta.
Vad är den lagliga grunden för personuppgiftsbehandlingen?
Aimo grundar denna personuppgiftsbehandling på en intresseavvägning. Aimos berättiga intresse består i att skydda Aimos personal mot hot och våld. Aimo har vägt detta intresse mot de registrerades intresse för skydd av sin personliga integritet och funnit att Aimos berättigade intresse väger tyngre. I denna bedömning har Aimo främst beaktat följande aspekter.
Finns det ett sätt att uppnå resultatet på ett mindre integritetskränkande sätt?
Aimo har tidigare använt sig enbart av överfallslarm. Det har dock visat sig att dessa larm inte har den avskräckande effekt för att motverka att parkeringsvakterna utsätts för hot och våld som en kroppskamera bedöms ha. Aimo har nått denna slutsats genom dokumenterade incidentrapporter från parkeringsvakterna. Det finns ingen annan teknisk lösning eller annat alternativ som kan uppnå samma effekt.
Vilka åtgärder har vidtagits för att begränsa personuppgiftsbehandlingen så långt som möjligt?
Aimo har säkerställt att kamerainspelningar enbart sparas om de behövs för att säkra bevisning i en polisanmälan och därefter i en domstolsprocess. Detta uppnås genom att använda en inspelningsteknik som kontinuerligt raderar material som inte aktivt sparas genom manuell aktivering av parkeringsvakten. Personalen har utbildats för att säkerställa att inget mer än nödvändigt sparas.
Hur länge sparas personuppgifterna?
Inspelningarna på kameran överförs efter ett arbetspass till den centrala servern och raderas därefter automatiskt direkt lokalt på den aktuella kameran. I servern sparas inspelningarna i en månad. Därefter raderas inspelningarna automatiskt, om de inte specifikt undantas av HR-personal vid en eventuell utredning av en incident. Anledningen till att inspelningarna sparas under denna period är att parkeringsvakterna vid en eventuell incident ska ha tid att anmäla densamma. Därefter ska den inblandade HR-personalen beredas möjlighet att gå in i systemet och undanta den aktuella inspelningen från automatisk radering.
Det material som markerats som bevis raderas automatiskt efter sex månader, eller tidigare om utlämning har skett till åklagare eller polis. Syftet med att spara materialet är begränsat till att lämna ut det till åklagare och polis. Materialet får inte användas för att bevaka Aimos personal eller i övrigt granska personalens prestation.
Var behandlas personuppgifterna?
Samtliga personuppgifter behandlas inom EU/EES. Ingen överföring av personuppgifterna till tredje land sker. Lagring sker på Aimos server inom EU/EES.
Vilka kan ta del av personuppgifterna?
Personuppgifterna delas enbart med tredje part vid en eventuell rättsprocess. I sådant fall delas de med åklagare och polis. I övrigt hanterar Aimo själv kamerorna och den tekniska miljö där inspelningarna lagras. Leverantören av mjukvaran och kamerorna har ingen åtkomst till något inspelat material, utan levererar enbart ouppkopplad hårdvara och mjukvara.
