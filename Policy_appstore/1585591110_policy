Privacy Policy for Consumer Automotive Applications
Last Updated: September 7, 2023
Your privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we process your personal data when you use our Consumer Automotive websites, apps, products, and services, including the Garmin Drive™ app, Vault and live view services, Smartphone Link app, Garmin Motorize™ app, Tread® app, dēzl™ app, Garmin Catalyst™ app, NAVIGON select Telekom Edition apps, and other websites or apps that link to this policy.
NAVIGON, a Garmin brand,
has been discontinued
as of Dec. 1, 2020.
Other Garmin websites, services, apps, and products that include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy. For example, if you enable features that upload location-based activity data, such as location, timestamp, elevation, speed, distance, course, tracks, routes, waypoints, and vehicle profile, our use of such data is subject to the privacy policy for
Garmin Outdoor and Recreation

Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:
When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish. We may also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We process your email address and password because you use your email address and password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address and password for this purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you enable two-factor authentication, we process your mobile phone number or email address to send the security code via SMS or email. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you reside in mainland China, we process your mobile phone number for purposes of real name authentication.
(b) We also process your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on our websites or apps or engage with other users. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is our legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other users.
(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receive direct marketing information from us, we will also process your email address or other account identifiers for the purpose of sending you marketing communications (e.g., emails, push notifications) about our products, services, and apps, as well as newsletters. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your
preferences
in your account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from us are based on the preferences you provide in your account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your  account, and any subscriptions included in your account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is our legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails. If you reside in mainland China, we may use your mobile phone number to send you marketing communications via SMS.
(d) We also process your email address to associate it with your account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.

With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process this information to provide you with customer and product support, to monitor the quality and types of customer and product support we provide to our customers, and to facilitate repairs, returns, or exchanges. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is our legitimate interest in providing quality product support. The legal ground for signing in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue is your consent, which you may withdraw.

PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
This data is aggregated with data from other consenting users and is used to enhance the quality of our products, services, and apps and the traffic, parking, and other features enabled by us or third parties.
