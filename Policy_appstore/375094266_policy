MobileIron
The first mobile‑centric security platform
MobileIron was founded in 2007 by Ajay Mishra and Suresh Batchu as the industry’s first mobile-centric, zero trust platform built on a unified endpoint management (UEM) foundation. MobileIron’s mobile-centric, zero trust approach ensured that only authorized users, devices, apps and services could access business resources. The company went public in 2014, trading under the ticker symbol MOBL.
