E. What are the main purposes for processing your personal data?
For the purpose of concluding and fulfilling the contract
Due to the process of conclusion and fulfillment of the contract, the Company processes your
                    personal data to provide access to the software (Games) of the Company for the user (Player), to
                    provide player support and improve the quality of services provided by the Company, necessary for
                    the proper function through updates and enhancements, enhancing the game environment, and providing
                    new functionalities. For this purpose, the Company may follow your interactions with the Company,
                    monitor different areas of your interest, and use your information to personalize our communication
                    with you, including offering in-game surveys. The collected data can also be used for purposes of
                    optimizing and improving the content of services provided to you by the Company as part of the
                    software and to detect potential malfunctions and errors.
Collected and processed data by the Company may also be used to compile and publish general
                    statistical reports to extend and customize services provided to players, appealing to their
                    preferences. These data do not contain information that could lead to the identification of any
                    individual.
Data collected by the Company for the designed purposes are processed based on the contractual
                    agreement between the Company and end-users – Players – in the form of defined licensing terms and
                    agreements about the use of products and services provided by the Company (EULA).
The EULA is a contract in accordance with Article 6, point 1, letter b) GDPR for determining the
                    legal basis for processing personal data.
For the needs of the above-defined purposes, the Company processes personal data mentioned in
                    Section C of this Policy, as well as the following personal data of the players:
Registration and authentication via Apple, Google
Direct registration: e-mail address and other traffic data
For the purpose of direct marketing
Under the conditions of its software (game), the Company also uses the functionality of so-called
                    “banners,” through which the player is offered “gems” (a specific kind of payment under the
                    conditions of each game). This menu is displayed to the players while using software (playing the
                    game) as one of the options within the game settings or menu. The player can purchase additional
                    options, extensions, accessories, or other functionalities within the terms of a specific game
                    through these menus.
Based on a similar approach, various limited offers (so-called “premium items”) are promoted to
                    purchase special editions of particular elements under the conditions of the software.
These activities represent the form of direct marketing used by the Company (in relation to
                    aforementioned regulations) oriented at specific players and addressing their potential needs.
The Company implements these activities only under the conditions of the software (game) itself. The
                    use of these activities does not lead players to the process of purchase, nor does it limit them in
                    common use of the game.
According to GDPR, the legal basis for processing your personal data in terms of this form of
                    marketing is the legitimate interest of the Company in accordance with Article 6, point 1, letter f)
                    and in accordance with section 47 of the GDPR.
For the direct marketing purposes, the Company processes the following personal data of players:
E-mail address
User ID
IP address
In-App Purchases
All in-app purchases must be made through the official platforms provided by Google or Apple. Any
                    purchases made through unofficial platforms will be considered a violation of the terms and may
                    result in the termination of the player's account.
F. To whom can your personal data be provided?
We process your personal data to the fullest extent possible internally within the Company. Your
                    personal data is provided to other subjects only when necessary to achieve the purpose of
                    processing.
We do not sell your personal data to other businesses. Your personal data might, in some cases, be
                    disclosed to and processed by our intermediaries for business purposes (see below); however,

                    and will not sell the personal data of our customers (Players).
