PRIVACY UPDATE REGARDING THE CENTRAL CREDIT REGISTER & CENTRAL STATISTICS OFFICE
What is the Central Credit Register?
The Central Credit Register is a mandatory database of credit information established by the Central Bank, under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 as amended (“the Act”).
Under the Act, lenders are obliged to submit credit information and personal information on loans of €500 or more to the Central Credit Register.
Personal information, such as name, address, date of birth, gender and personal public service number (PPSN), is necessary for the purposes of accurately identifying borrowers and matching their loans, including loans they may have with more than one lender.
This information is stored securely on the Central Credit Register and is released only: when a lender or the borrower to whom the information relates requests access; if the borrower to whom the information relates, consents to the release of this information to another person; as provided by the Credit Report Act 2013 as amended, the Data Protection Act 2018 or as required or permitted by law or any other applicable legislation. The Central Bank may also transfer information to state agencies and law enforcement bodies when it is considered necessary and proportionate to do so. See
www.centralcreditregister
for more information.
Why does the CSO require the transfer of Central Credit Register data ?
The Central Credit Register is a database of loans, including consumer loans such as credit cards, mortgages, personal loans and overdrafts. As debt is a sizeable factor in the financial wellbeing of households, the availability of accurate data relating to the amount of money owed by borrowers is essential for providing timely statistics about household debt.
The CSO will use the loan information available in the Central Credit Register together with household income and expenditure data to produce a complete picture of the financial wellbeing of Irish households.  This is information is an invaluable resource and will be used by policymakers, decision makers, economists and researchers.
