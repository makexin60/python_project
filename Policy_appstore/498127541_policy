Our mobile applications may include third-party application software development kits that allow third parties to collect data about our users to provide us with analytics about how they use our apps, to enable social media functionality and for advertising purposes. This data may include your IP address, unique device identifiers, unique application and advertising identifiers, your approximate location, other data about your devices, and information about how you interact with the apps.

Social Networks
Our Services allow you to connect with social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. If you connect the Services to a social network, you authorize us to access and use the information that you agreed the platform could provide to us based on your settings for that social network.

How We Use Your Personal Information
We use your personal information in ways that are compatible with the purposes listed below or as subsequently authorized by you.

Other users will also be able to see the content that you post in public areas of the Services or social media platforms, content you share with them, and any content you post if they have the URL for that content. While we use randomized identifiers to make it difficult to guess the location of your content, we cannot prevent users who have the URL to your content from sharing it with other users or the public. Your followers and collaborators will be able to see the content you share with them actions you take within the Services within their activity feeds, such as when you like, follow or comment on a post. Your collaborators' activity feeds will also show them when someone collaborates or requests to collaborate on your post or when someone posts content you have collaborated in.
Please be mindful about the content you post and share and who you are making it available to. Remember that it is possible for users who can see your activity or content on the Services to download it, screenshot it or share it with others on and off the Services, including others outside of your intended audience.

California ‘Do Not Sell My Info’ Notice.
If we use advertising services, we may use advertising services that use information collected from cookies and similar technologies to try to make the ads you see on other websites more relevant to your interests. This is called interest-based advertising. See our
Advertising Technology Notice
. Although we do not sell your information to these companies for money, our use of these services may constitute a “sale” of Personal Information from which you have the right to opt-out for purposes of the CCPA. You can opt-out of the use of your information for interest-based advertising by:
Browser settings.
Blocking third party cookies in your web browser settings.
Privacy browsers/plug-ins.
Using privacy browsers or ad-blocking browser plug-ins that let you block advertising trackers.
Ad industry tools.
Opting-out of interest-based ads from companies participating in the following industry opt-out programs:
Network Advertising Initiative:
https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx
Digital Advertising Alliance:
Opt-out (
optout.aboutads.info
), which will allow you to opt-out of interest based ads served by on websites by participating members.
AppChoices mobile app (available at
https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices
), which will allow you to opt-out of interest-based ads in mobile apps served by participating members.
Mobile settings.
Using your mobile device settings to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.
We recommend that you take all of these steps if you want to prevent collection of your information for interest-based ads. You will need to apply these opt-out settings on each device from which you wish to opt-out. Not all companies that serve interest-based ads participate in these opt-out programs, so even after opting-out, you may still receive cookies and interest-based ads from other companies. If you opt-out, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.

Government-issued identification may be required for both the requester and the authorized agent.
