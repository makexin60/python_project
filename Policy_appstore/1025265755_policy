Application Subscription
SnailSleep offers enhanced features of the Services for purchase through monthly, yearly subscriptions ("Subscriptions"). Details regarding Subscription features are accessible via the Services. When you make a purchase, you may need to provide additional information relevant to your Transaction, such as credit card details and billing/delivery addresses ("Payment Information"). You confirm that you have the legal right to use all payment methods associated with the provided Payment Information. The amounts payable for Transactions will be disclosed before you confirm your order. By initiating a Transaction via the Services, you authorize us to share your Payment Information with third-party service providers for Transaction completion and acknowledge the following:
- You agree to pay applicable fees and taxes.
- SnailSleep may charge your credit card or third-party payment processing account, including accounts with App Providers, for verification, pre-authorization, and payment purposes.
- You accept responsibility for any additional charges imposed by your App Provider, bank, or financial service provider, as well as any applicable taxes or fees. Your order is not binding until accepted and confirmed by SnailSleep. All payments made are non-refundable and non-transferable, except as expressly provided in these Terms.
If you encounter any concerns or objections regarding charges, you agree to first address them with us and refrain from canceling or rejecting any credit card or third-party payment processing charges unless you have made a reasonable effort to resolve the matter directly with SnailSleep. SnailSleep reserves the discretion to not process or cancel your order under certain circumstances, such as if your credit card is declined or if there are suspicions of fraudulence. Additionally, SnailSleep reserves the right to verify your identity and may request additional information to complete your Transaction. We will not charge or refund orders that we do not process or cancel.
You have the option to terminate your membership at any time, but your membership will remain valid for the subscription period you have already paid for.
