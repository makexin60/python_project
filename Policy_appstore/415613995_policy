Meeting our Responsible Gambling Obligations
We take responsible gambling very seriously at Entain. We may share your information across our brands in the Entain Group, and where required with other organisations to meet our responsible gambling commitments.
We have an obligation to identify those at harm from gambling as early as we can and help them stop gambling by placing certain limits on accounts; this could include deposit limits, product limits, limiting the ability of an account to gamble certain products / times / periods. In order to meet these obligations, we analyse customer’s transactions and evaluate behaviour or financial status across our products and brands, which may lead us to make decisions on your account(s).
We are also constantly looking at innovative ways to help spot players who may be on a path to difficulties and identify them digitally. This means that we may use systems that identify customers (such as cookies on player’s devices or images sent by you) and internally we have developed systems to understand your play to better communicate any risks concerning your activity. We may also share or receive player data with other organisations who help evaluate risks or assess affordability by looking at how you may interact with other gambling operators or help individuals directly.
In all these cases, please be assured that we take our obligations very seriously, in helpingcustomers gamble responsibly and in protecting your personal information. We will always ensure that we takethe mostappropriate measures and controls to protect your data
If you are a customer in the Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the following initiative called “GamProtect” applies to you.

You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights.
The right of access
A right to access personal data held by us about you. This right is not an absolute right and must not be interpreted in isolation of the other provisions of the GDPR/UK GDPR. There are lawful limitations to this right that it may apply, for instance, where other rights such as; confidentiality, the rights of others, legal privilege and/or the right to apply adversarial disclosure rules in the course of a potential claim or the defence or establishment of a claim are in scope and need to be balanced with the right of access.
The right to rectification
A right to require us to rectify any inaccurate personal data held by us about you.
The right to erasure
A right to require us to erase personal data held by us about you. This right will only apply where (for example): we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for; or where you withdraw your consent if we are using your personal data based on your consent; or where you object to the way we process your data (in line with Right 6 below). This right is not absolute and will not apply when legitimate and overriding reasons apply.
The right to restrict processing
In certain circumstances, a right to restrict our processing of personal data held by us about you. This right will only apply where (for example): you dispute the accuracy of the personal data held by us; or where you would have the right to require us to erase the personal data but would prefer that our processing is restricted instead; or where we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for, but you require the data for the purposes of dealing with legal claims.
The right to data portability
In certain circumstances, a right to receive personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to require us to transfer this personal data to another organisation, at your request.
The right to object processing
A right to object to our processing of personal data held by us about you where the processing of such data is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests, unless we are able to demonstrate, on balance, legitimate grounds for continuing to process personal data which override your rights or which are for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

A right for you not to be subject to a decision based solely on an automated process, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you.
The right to withdraw consent

Meeting our Responsible Gambling Obligations
We take responsible gambling very seriously at Entain. We may share your information across our brands in the Entain Group, and where required with other organisations to meet our responsible gambling commitments.
We have an obligation to identify those at harm from gambling as early as we can and help them stop gambling by placing certain limits on accounts; this could include deposit limits, product limits, limiting the ability of an account to gamble certain products / times / periods. In order to meet these obligations, we analyse customer’s transactions and evaluate behaviour or financial status across our products and brands, which may lead us to make decisions on your account(s). Please see the on our website for more information.
We are also constantly looking at innovative ways to help spot players who may be on a path to difficulties and identify them digitally. This means that we may use systems that identify customers (such as cookies on player’s devices or images sent by you) and internally we have developed systems to understand your play to better communicate any risks concerning your activity. We may also share or receive player data with other organisations who help evaluate risks or assess affordability by looking at how you may interact with other gambling operators or help individuals directly.
In all these cases, please be assured that we take our obligations very seriously, in helping customers gamble responsibly and in protecting your personal information. We will always ensure that we take the most appropriate measures and controls to protect your data.

Much of the information we collect about you is required to meet our legal and regulatory obligations, such as gambling Legislation or any other applicable laws, however, we will ask your consent prior to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information, unless an exception applies.
We may also store more sensitive personal data about you which may come directly from you, from other sources as described above or from decisions we have made about you (e.g. Responsible Gambling related data).
Some of these decisions or actions we may take in managing your account or meeting our legal obligations may involve fully automated decisions.  We will however always provide you with contact details where you can ask for a review of the decision or get further information from us.
Who we share your data with
We may need to share personal information with other organisations to ensure that we meet our legal obligations, where we need support in meeting your needs or our contractual obligations or where it is permitted or required by applicable law.  These other parties are typically:
Business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;
Our affiliates and selected third parties, where you have expressly opted-out of receiving marketing from us / third parties, have been barred or self-excluded, in which case we may share suppression lists with our affiliates and selected third parties, to ensure you do not receive unsolicited marketing from us;
Members of the Entain Group and third party suppliers and service providers for any of the purposes identified in the table above; third party suppliers and service providers to the extent they assist the Entain Group with its legal / regulatory obligations e.g. providers of services in respect of anti-money laundering, fraud, verification etc.;
Selected third parties so that they can contact you with details of the services that they provide, where you have expressly opted-in/consented to the disclosure of your personal data for these purposes;
Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of our site and other selected third parties;
Other 3
rd
party organisations who ask, encourage or collate feedback and any online views of your experiences with us to help us improve and optimize our services;
Banks, credit card companies and relevant agencies who may share with third parties for the purpose of investigating and safeguarding against underage, fraudulent, criminal or suspicious activity or safer gambling (or other activities we are bound by law, regulation or guidance to investigate and safeguard against) or if we have reason to believe that you have undertaken such activity; and
Our regulators, law enforcement or fraud prevention agencies, as well as our legal advisers, courts, applicable independent adjudication services and integrity organisations and any other authorised bodies, for the purposes of investigating any actual or suspected criminal activity, maintaining standards of behaviour in the services we provide or other regulatory or legal matters.
We may share your personal information with other members of the Entain Group.  We will not share it with other 3
rd
party organisations however unless you have expressly opted-in/consented to the disclosure of your personal data for these purposes.
We may also disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances:
In the event that we consider selling or buying any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to any prospective sellers or buyers of such business or assets;
In the event of any insolvency situation (e.g. the administration or liquidation) of Entain Group plc, or a data controller or any of its group entities;
If we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets;
In order to enforce or apply our website terms of use;
To protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our staff, our customers, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations (including without limitation, other gambling operators and the local police or other local law enforcement agencies) for the purposes of staff and customer safety, crime prevention, fraud protection and credit risk reduction;
If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or regulatory requirements, or otherwise for the prevention or detection of fraud or crime;
when we check your identity when you first become a customer, we share information with Credit Reference Agencies and this will leave a “soft” footprint on your credit file. Further information about how these agencies hold and use your information can be found in their relevant websites; and
Where you have self-excluded yourself from gambling, we may share this information with our regulators or other companies in our field where we believe it is important to support your exclusion.
Meeting our Responsible Gambling Obligations
We take responsible gambling very seriously at Entain. We may share your information across our brands in the Entain Group, and where required with other organisations to meet our responsible gambling commitments.
We have a moral obligation to identify those at harm from gambling as early as we can and help them stop gambling by placing certain limits on accounts; this could include deposit limits, product limits, limiting the ability of an account to gamble certain products / times / periods. In order to meet these obligations, we analyse customer’s transactions and evaluate behaviour or financial status across our products and brands, which may lead us to make decisions on your account(s).
We are also constantly looking at innovative ways to help spot players who may be on a path to difficulties and identify them digitally. This means that we may use systems that identify customers (such as cookies on player’s devices or images sent by you) and internally we have developed systems to understand your play to better communicate any risks concerning your activity.
In all these cases, please be assured that we take our obligations very seriously, in helping customers gamble responsibly and in protecting your personal information.

We may need to share personal information with other organisations to ensure that we meet our legal obligations or where we need support in meeting your needs or our contractual obligations. We may also share information with other organisations where we consider it to be in the public interest or in the legitimate interest of ourselves or these other parties. These other parties are typically:
business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;
our affiliates and selected third parties, where you have expressly opted-out of receiving marketing from us / third parties, have been barred or self-excluded, in which case we may share suppression lists with our affiliates and selected third parties, to ensure you do not receive unsolicited marketing;
members of the Entain Group and third party suppliers and service providers for any of the purposes identified in the table above; third party suppliers and service providers to the extent they assist the Entain Group with its legal / regulatory obligations e.g. providers of services in respect of anti-money laundering, fraud, verification etc.;

Social Media platforms, where for example you chose to log onto your gaming account with us through your Social Media identity. Or when we communicate with you via your Social media account;
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of our site and other selected third parties;

Banks, credit card companies, Sports Governing Bodies and relevant agencies who may share with third parties for the purpose of investigating and safeguarding against underage, fraudulent, criminal or suspicious activity or safer gambling and affordability checks (or other activities we are bound by law, regulation or guidance to investigate and safeguard against) or if we have reason to believe that you have undertaken such activity;
our regulators, law enforcement or fraud prevention agencies, as well as our legal advisers, courts, applicable independent adjudication services, Sports Governing Bodies and any other authorised bodies for the purposes of investigating any actual or suspected criminal activity, maintaining standards of behaviour in sports, gaming or other regulatory or legal matters.
We may share your personal information with other members of the Entain Group for marketing purposes. We will not share it with other 3rd party organisations however unless you have expressly opted-in/consented to the disclosure of your personal data for these purposes.
We may also disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances:
in the event that we consider selling or buying any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to any prospective sellers or buyers of such business or assets;
in the event of any insolvency situation (e.g. the administration or liquidation) of Entain Group plc, or a data controller or any of its group entities;

Where you have self-excluded yourself from gambling, we may share this information with our regulators or other companies in our field where we believe it is important to support your exclusion.
Meeting our Responsible Gambling Obligations
We take responsible gambling very seriously at Entain. We may share your information across our brands in the Entain Group, and where required with other organisations to meet our responsible gambling commitments.
We have an obligation to identify those at harm from gambling as early as we can and help them stop gambling by placing certain limits on accounts; this could include deposit limits, product limits, limiting the ability of an account to gamble certain products / times / periods. In order to meet these obligations, we analyse customer’s transactions and evaluate behaviour or financial status across our products and brands, which may lead us to make decisions on your account(s). Please see the Affordability section on our website for more information.
We are also constantly looking at innovative ways to help spot players who may be on a path to difficulties and identify them digitally. This means that we may use systems that identify customers (such as cookies on player’s devices or images sent by you) and internally we have developed systems to understand your play to better communicate any risks concerning your activity. We may also share or receive player data with other organisations who help evaluate risks or assess affordability by looking at how you may interact with other gambling operators or help individuals directly.
In all these cases, please be assured that we take our obligations very seriously, in helping customers gamble responsibly and in protecting your personal information. We will always ensure that we take the most appropriate measures and controls to protect your data.

Type of Data
Typical Retention Time
Information

We will only continue to hold personal data relating to your account as permitted under data protection legislation (i) where we are under a legal requirement under gambling or tax legislation to retain your data; and (ii) to exercise or defend our legal rights
If you register under the self-exclusion scheme, whilst the self-exclusion itself may have a shorter duration, a record of this will be retained longer as part of your customer profile.
The above retention times may be extended for example where it is needed to meet a specific regulatory obligation, investigate a crime, handle a claim or resolve a complaint
Locations that we may transfer your personal data
From time to time, service providers, members of the Entain Group and organisations with whom we work with, may be located outside the UK or European Economic Area in countries that do not have the same standards of protection for personal data as the UK or EEA Countries. We will, however, always use every reasonable effort to ensure sufficient protections are in place to safeguard your personal data. We will also ensure that our service providers enter into compliant processing agreements with us to ensure that your personal data is processed in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. Further information about the mechanisms we will apply can be found here but please contact us on the email address below if you have any specific questions regarding international transfers: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en.

We take compliance with security regulations, standards, guidelines and privacy laws very seriously and promote security measures that will maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data. We use reasonable organisational, technical and administrative measures to protect customer personal data from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data that we hold.
As a business, we have secure firewalled datacentres, certified encrypted webpages and we are ISO27001:2013 certified. We also take steps to ensure our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers employ adequate levels of security across the business.

Meeting our Responsible Gambling Obligations
We take responsible gambling very seriously at Entain. We may share your information across our brands in the Entain Group, and where required with other organisations to meet our responsible gambling commitments.
We have an obligation to identify those at harm from gambling as early as we can and help them stop gambling by placing certain limits on accounts; this could include deposit limits, product limits, limiting the ability of an account to gamble certain products / times / periods. In order to meet these obligations, we analyse customer’s transactions and evaluate behaviour or financial status across our products and brands, which may lead us to make decisions on your account(s). Please see the Affordability section on our website for more information.
We are also constantly looking at innovative ways to help spot players who may be on a path to difficulties and identify them digitally. This means that we may use systems that identify customers (such as cookies on player’s devices or images sent by you) and internally we have developed systems to understand your play to better communicate any risks concerning your activity. We may also share or receive player data with other organisations who help evaluate risks or assess affordability by looking at how you may interact with other gambling operators or help individuals directly.
In all these cases, please be assured that we take our obligations very seriously, in helping customers gamble responsibly and in protecting your personal information. We will always ensure that we take the most appropriate measures and controls to protect your data.

Type of Data
Typical Retention Time
Information
Customer Call recordings
3 years
An extended retention may be applied on a case by case basis
Customer Data
A 5-year retention period which starts to run from the date your account is closed
We will only continue to hold personal data relating to your account as permitted under data protection legislation (i) where we are under a legal requirement under gambling or tax legislation to retain your data; and (ii) to exercise or defend our legal rights
If you register under the self-exclusion scheme, whilst the self-exclusion itself may have a shorter duration, a record of this will be retained longer as part of your customer profile.
The above retention times may be extended for example where it is needed to meet a specific regulatory obligation, investigate a crime, handle a claim or resolve a complaint
Locations that we may transfer your personal data
From time to time, service providers, members of the Entain Group and organisations with whom we work with, may be located outside the UK or European Economic Area in countries that do not have the same standards of protection for personal data as the UK or EEA Countries. We will, however, always use every reasonable effort to ensure sufficient protections are in place to safeguard your personal data. We will also ensure that our service providers enter into compliant processing agreements with us to ensure that your personal data is processed in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. Further information about the mechanisms we will apply can be found here but please contact us on the email address below if you have any specific questions regarding international transfers: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en.
Security
We take compliance with security regulations, standards, guidelines and privacy laws very seriously and promote security measures that will maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data. We use reasonable organisational, technical and administrative measures to protect customer personal data from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data that we hold.
As a business, we have secure firewalled datacentres, certified encrypted webpages and we are ISO27001:2013 certified. We also take steps to ensure our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers employ adequate levels of security across the business.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access attempts.
