Your Rights "Subject Access Requests"

(a) the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for this purpose, we will usually accept a photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original copy of a utility bill showing your current address.
We may withhold personal information that you request to the extent permitted by law.
Your Rights under GDPR and Data Protection Legislation
In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
Your principal rights under data protection law are:
(a) the right to access;
(b) the right to rectification;
(c) the right to erasure;
(d) the right to restrict processing;
(e) the right to object to processing;
(f) the right to data portability;
(g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
(h) the right to withdraw consent.
You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
iWare Designs Limited does not perform any form of marketing.  If this change in the future, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:
(a)	consent; or
(b)	that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract,
                and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by emailing us:

Windows 10
The new Microsoft Edge
helps you browse, search, shop online, and more. Like all modern browsers, Microsoft Edge lets you collect and store specific data on your device, like cookies, and lets you send information to us, like browsing history, to make the experience as rich, fast, and personal as possible.
Whenever we collect data, we want to make sure it’s the right choice for you. Some people worry about their web browsing history being collected. That’s why we tell you what data is stored on your device or collected by us. We give you choices to control what data gets collected. For more information about privacy in Microsoft Edge, we recommend reviewing our
Privacy Statement
.
What data is collected or stored, and why
Microsoft uses diagnostic data to improve our products and services. We use this data to better understand how our products are performing and where improvements need to be made.
Microsoft Edge collects a set of required diagnostic data to keep Microsoft Edge secure, up to date and performing as expected. Microsoft believes in and practices information collection minimization. We strive to gather only the info we need, and to store it only for as long as it’s needed to provide a service or for analysis. In addition, you can control whether optional diagnostic data associated with your device is shared with Microsoft to solve product issues and help improve Microsoft products and services.
As you use features and services in Microsoft Edge, diagnostic data about how you use those features is sent to Microsoft. Microsoft Edge saves your browsing history—information about websites you visit—on your device. Depending on your settings, this browsing history is sent to Microsoft, which helps us find and fix problems and improve our products and services for all users. You can manage the collection of optional diagnostic data in the browser by selecting

and turning on or off
Help improve Microsoft products by sending optional diagnostic data about how you use the browser, websites you visit, and crash reports
. This includes data from testing new experiences. To finish making changes to this setting, restart Microsoft Edge.
Turning this setting on allows this optional diagnostic data to be shared with Microsoft from other applications using Microsoft Edge, such as a video streaming app that hosts the Microsoft Edge web platform to stream the video. The Microsoft Edge web platform will send info about how you use the web platform and sites you visit in the application to Microsoft.  This data collection is determined by your optional diagnostic data setting in Privacy, search, and services settings in Microsoft Edge.
On Windows 10, these settings are determined by your Windows diagnostic setting. To change your diagnostic data setting, select

As of
March 6th 2024,
Microsoft Edge diagnostic data is collected separately from Windows diagnostic data on Windows 10 (version 22H2 and newer) and Windows 11 (version 23H2 and newer) devices in the European Economic Area. For these Windows versions, and on all other platforms, you can change your settings in Microsoft Edge by selecting

, and turn on
Show me search and site suggestions using my typed characters
. As you start to type, the info you enter in the address bar is sent to your default search provider to give you immediate search and website suggestions.
When you use InPrivate browsing or guest mode, Microsoft Edge collects some info about how you use the browser depending on your Windows diagnostic data setting or Microsoft Edge privacy settings, but automatic suggestions are turned off and info about websites you visit is not collected. Microsoft Edge will delete your browsing history, cookies, and site data, as well as passwords, addresses, and form data when you close all InPrivate windows. You can start a new InPrivate session by selecting

on a computer or

on a mobile device.
Microsoft Edge also has features to help you and your content stay safe online. Windows Defender SmartScreen automatically blocks websites and content downloads that are reported to be malicious. Windows Defender SmartScreen checks the address of the webpage you're visiting against a list of webpage addresses stored on your device that Microsoft believes to be legitimate. Addresses that aren't on your device’s list and the addresses of files you're downloading will be sent to Microsoft and checked against a frequently updated list of webpages and downloads that have been reported to Microsoft as unsafe or suspicious.
To speed up tedious tasks like filling out forms and entering passwords, Microsoft Edge can save info to help. If you choose to use those features, Microsoft Edge stores the info on your device. If you’ve turned on sync for form fill like addresses or passwords, this info will be sent to the Microsoft cloud and stored with your Microsoft account to be synced across all your signed-in versions of Microsoft Edge. You can manage this data from

To integrate your browsing experience with other activities you do on your device, Microsoft Edge shares your browsing history with Microsoft Windows through its Indexer. This information is stored locally on the device. It includes URLs, a category in which the URL might be relevant, such as “most visited”, “recently visited”, or “recently closed”, and also a relative frequency or recency within each category. Websites you visit while in InPrivate mode will not be shared. This information is then available to other applications on the device, such as the start menu or taskbar.

To protect some video and music content from being copied, some streaming websites store Digital Rights Management (DRM) data on your device, including a unique identifier (ID) and media licenses. When you go to one of these websites, it retrieves the DRM info to make sure you have permission to use the content.
Microsoft Edge also stores cookies, small files that are put on your device as you browse the web. Many websites use cookies to store info about your preferences and settings, like saving the items in your shopping cart so you don't have to add them each time you visit. Some websites also use cookies to collect info about your online activity to show you interest-based advertising. Microsoft Edge gives you options to clear cookies and block websites from saving cookies in the future.
Microsoft Edge will send Do Not Track requests to websites when the
Send Do Not Track requests
setting is turned on. Websites may still track your activities even when a Do Not Track request is sent, however.

OVERVIEW
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how information (both customer and end user information) is collected and utilized by Chartboost, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Chartboost”, “our”, or “we”). This Privacy Policy applies to the websites provided by Chartboost, including without limitation, www.Chartboost.com (the “Sites”) and Chartboost’s online services (“Online Services”). Our Online Services allow publishers of mobile applications to show ads on their applications, and advertisers to reach audiences that may be interested in their products or services (“Customers” or “customers” refers to publishers and advertisers (current and prospective) and their employees. “End users” or “end users” refers to end users of our customers’ services.” “You” and “your” refers collectively to customers and end users). If you have any concerns about this Privacy Policy you may send an email to
privacy@chartboost.com
.
1. COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION
Purposes of processing
. Our primary goals in collecting and using information are:
to provide the Online Services and the Sites,
to administer and assist customers with their Online Services account, and
to provide a better experience with and to improve the Online Services.
How we process your data
. Information about customers and end users will be stored and processed by us in the United States. For more information about the transfer of your data to the United States, please refer to Section 5.
Legal basis for processing
. Some jurisdictions require a legal basis for processing personal data. The EU and Swiss and similar legal systems’ legal basis for the processing of end users’ personal data is consent for our use of end user personal data and the performance of the agreement between Customer and Chartboost Inc for our use of end user personal data on behalf of customers, or, for employees working for a customer, the legitimate interests Chartboost has in processing such data in order to provide the Online Services to our customers. In some instances, we may also rely on consent that has been given for specific forms of processing.
2. WHAT INFORMATION WE PROCESS
a) Information about Customers
Registration
: During the registration process on our Sites, customers may be asked for certain information, which may include their name, their email address, the company for which they work, their country, and a password. This registration information is used to validate customers when they visit the Sites. It may also be used to send customers additional promotional information about our services. Employees of customers can opt out of receiving promotional emails at any time by using the link provided for this purpose in each email. If customers are entered in a Chartboost promotion in connection with their registration, we will also use their name and email address to contact them if they have won a prize in that promotion, and will ask them for the address at which they would like to receive their prize. We store all data associated with customer accounts, including contact information, applications and campaigns. Contact/Content: On the Sites we may offer online forms to enable customers to contact us. We may also offer customers the opportunity to request specific content, like newsletters and whitepapers we publish. When we request contact details (such as name and email address), we may ask for consent to use these to send information about our Online Services in the future.
Cookies and Beacons
: A “cookie” is a small text file that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. There are two types of cookies that may be used at our Sites: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie gets entered by a Web browser of a visitor to our Sites (“Site visitor”) into the “Cookies” folder on their computer and remains in this “Cookies” folder after their browser is closed. Persistent cookies may be used on subsequent visits to the Sites. A session cookie is held temporarily in a computer’s memory and disappears after a Site visitor closes their browser or shuts off their computer. The Sites or the emails we send may also use Web beacons (also called “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) in conjunction with cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page. If a Site visitor arrives at the Sites by clicking on a banner ad for one of our products or services, a session cookie may be used. This cookie will contain an identification number for the ad that a Site visitor clicked on, or will contain an identification number for the Sites that a Site visitor was visiting when they clicked on the banner ad. This session cookie helps Chartboost determine which of our ads attract the most visitors. If, after a Site visitor arrives at our Sites and requests further information from us about our products and services, the information provided in that request will be linked to the information in the session cookie. This also helps Chartboost measure the effectiveness of our advertising. Because this is a session cookie, it will disappear once a Site visitor closes their browser. Our Sites may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information collected in our log files (such as Internet Protocol Address, referring URLs, etc.) about activities at the Sites to better understand how the Sites are used, resolve technical problems, and enhance the experience of Site visitors. We may use a third-party email technology to send emails that customers have agreed to receive. Web beacons are used in those email messages to measure the effectiveness of our advertising. In addition, Chartboost may serve ads on the Sites using our own ad serving technology. In doing so, one of our ad servers will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on a Site visitor’s computer and will use information about their browser and activities at the Sites. The ad serving cookie is a persistent cookie. We may also allow third parties to place cookies on our Sites to track use of the site to enable us to analyze the traffic of our marketing pages. Examples of such providers of analytics services may include Google Analytics.
b) Information about End Users
Online Services
: When an ad is served through our Online Services, we and others may collect the following from end users’ devices: bundle ID, language ID, operating system version, device model, software developer kit (SDK) version, unique device identifier, and IP address. In order to enhance contextual targeting, we and others may collect some screen, audio, connectivity, storage and battery settings and information of devices. In addition, when an end user accesses a video ad, we and others may collect additional stats about videos and video playback such as: start/boot-up information, amount played/session length information, memory on device used for our video cache, videos cached on a device and complete view event. We identify an end user’s device using Chartboost’s internal device ID, which is linked to an end user’s Apple IDFA, Google Advertising ID (GAID), or Android ID, as applicable. If a customer uses Chartboost’s Post-Install Tools, which include Post-Install Analytics, Publisher Segmentation and Retargeting, we and others may access and collect data such as the following: when an end user launches the app, how long the end user plays the app, and in-app events. We and others may use this information to provide customers with an end user’s usage data, advertising campaign optimizations, and user re-targeting based on a user’s usage patterns. We also receive any of the information described in this section about end users from third party data providers, advertisers, or advertising services companies including mobile device identifiers, geolocation, IP addresses, website cookie information and usage data. We and others combine information about end users with additional demographic, geolocation and interest-based segment data, along with cookie information, including from third-party providers. We and others may also derive inferences about demographics, geolocation and interests based on end user information. The additional information we, infer, access, and collect may determine the nature of the ad that the end user sees. [GBdCG7] If customers do not want to expose end users to behaviorally targeted advertising campaigns, customers can choose to opt out of behavioral targeting by following the relevant instructions as set out on the Sites.
3. INFORMATION SHARING OR DISCLOSURE
We may share any of the information described above as follows.
Processors and service providers
. We contract with third parties to provide some part of the Online Service or to assist us in analyzing our services or information. Chartboost may provide this information to such third parties, or such third parties may collect information from you or the end users on our behalf or on behalf of our customers. We may also share this information with third parties with whom we have a strategic relationship, including on behalf of our customers, such as advertisers, demand side platforms, measurement/attribution companies, and advertising services companies. The information shared with these third parties may be used, among other things, for industry analysis, tracking ad conversions, cross-device matching, behavioral advertising or demographic profiling, and to provide services on behalf of our customers. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and applications.
Business partners
. We may also provide this information to our business partners or other trusted entities, including on behalf of our customers, for the purpose of providing you with information on goods and services we believe will be of interest to you.
Public authorities
. Public authorities. We may be required to disclose information about you in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, and will disclose such information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Chartboost, our customers, end users, or any third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable. In addition, we may disclose this information to third parties in connection with a corporate re-organization, bankruptcy, liquidation, merger or amalgamation, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
By Your request
. We may share information for other purposes if you or our customers direct us to do so or you consent to such sharing.
Aggregate or anonymous data
. Finally, in addition to the information described above, we may share aggregate or anonymous information about you or end users with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties, including on behalf of our customers.
4. PRIVACY PRACTICES OF CUSTOMERS AND THIRD PARTIES
In our Terms & Conditions, we require Chartboost customers to post a privacy policy, to provide and/or obtain all required end user notices and/or consents, and to comply with all applicable laws and self-regulatory guidelines, but we are not responsible for our customers’ privacy practices. To assist customers in compliance with their obligations under applicable law, our Privacy Policy contains information on the way Chartboost processes end user personal data. In particular, information given to the end users who are based in the EU, Switzerland or jurisdiction with similar rules at the time their consent is asked, should include the following:
the collection of their data by Chartboost as described in this Privacy Policy, including a link to this Privacy Policy;
that their data will be collected by Chartboost to show ads on customers’ applications, including ads which are based on behavioral targeting (for example: ads for games which are similar to those which they have installed and played before);
the transfer of their data to Chartboost in the US under the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses;
their rights as data subjects, as described in Section 8;
their right to withdraw consent at any time;
their right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
End users of a customer should review that customer’s privacy policies. We also do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other third party, and any website or service that links to or from our Sites or the Online Services. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Chartboost.
5. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Chartboost is a company based in the United States. In the context of the provision of Online Services, your Personal Data may be transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to Chartboost in the United States, and to our affiliates and third parties that are based in other countries. Any such transfers will be made on the basis of the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, as may be found at https://ec.europa.eu.
For the transfer of data from other jurisdictions to the United States, Chartboost relies on Your express consent to such transfer, as given on your access and use of Online Services, Online Service Interface and Online Service Apps. Chartboost will make all reasonable efforts to guarantee the same level of security, confidentiality and lawfulness for the processing occurring in the United States as You would have in your own country.
6. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
Chartboost adopts and employs adequate security measures to protect any and all personal data it collects, processes and holds on customers and end users. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to your data will not occur, we make good faith efforts to prevent such occurrences and, should they occur, we will take all the adequate and reasonable steps to eliminate or minimize the effects of such occurrence and to prevent it from happening again. We do not warrant or represent that your account or any of your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.
7. COMMUNICATIONS
It is our policy to provide communications, whether such communications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our customers via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our Sites, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our customers.
8. DO NOT TRACK, CALIFORNIA DO NOT SELL MY INFO, AND END USER CHOICES
Because the Sites we operate do not collect or use the type of information that is generally subject to your browser’s “Do Not Track” (DNT) privacy preference, our websites do not look for this signal from your browser. Your DNT settings, however, may affect the third-party services we use. You may control how your browser responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your web browser. You may opt out of interest-based advertisements by adjusting the settings on your mobile device. For iOS mobile devices, go to “Settings” from the device’s home screen; scroll down to “Privacy”; select “Advertising”; and turn on “Limit Ad Tracking.” For Android mobile devices, go to “Google Settings” on the device; select “Ads”; and check the box labeled “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads.” You can review https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices for more information regarding how you may opt out via the mobile platform. If you would like to disable the collection of your mobile device geolocation information, you can make this selection on your mobile device. To learn more about interest-based advertising, and to access the opt-outs of certain online advertising companies, visit the Network Advertising Initiative at https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) at https://www.aboutads.info/choices/. You should complete the opt-out process for all devices and browsers you use. If you opt-out of targeted advertising, you will still receive general advertisements.

Our Privacy Principles for the use of data about Targeted End Users
Liftoff’s systems aggregate events/data at granularities that cover many users, as opposed to a specific user, unless the user consents. For instance: users with iPhone X’s in San Francisco have clicked on ads in app A 100 times and installed app B 50 times.
Liftoff does not tie together events/data across apps in a user-specific way, without the user’s consent. For instance: we do not track that a person did X in app A and also Y in app B from a different publisher, if the person opts-out of interest-based advertising.
Instead, Liftoff only ties events/data from a given specific user within the context of a given app. E.g. user with app-local ID 123 installed app A, then finished the tutorial, then made a purchase.
This allows Liftoff to understand the conversion rates from one event to another within an app, but not track the activities of a user across different apps.
Liftoff does not record or store personal information that the user cannot easily revoke, such as email address, physical address, photographs or phone number to personalize our advertising. Liftoff relies upon device IDs to uniquely identify a user, and Liftoff solely relies upon the user’s consent in allowing Liftoff to access this information.
Liftoff does not export per-user data outside of Liftoff, except for validation purposes to a company that already has access to that data
Details of how to opt-out of interest-based advertising from us can be found at:

V. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Your personal information may be collected, transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located, including the United States and other countries where we or our group companies or service providers (among others) maintain facilities. Our group affiliates and our third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. We maintain primary data centers in the United States, Singapore, Japan and Germany. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Privacy Policy and according to applicable law.
We have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, including by entering into the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal information, or where required, we will ask you for your prior written consent for such international data transfers.
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland which have been formally recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” and “adequacy regulations” from the European Commission, Swiss and UK authorities.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision, we take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. These safeguards include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021 under Article 46(2) GDPR for transfers originating in the EEA, UK and Switzerland; and the UK Addendum under Article 46(2) of the UK GDPR for the transfer of data originating in the UK.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses entered into by our group companies and with our third-party service providers and partners can be provided on request. Please note that some sensitive commercial information will be redacted. If you have any questions or concerns related to international data transfers, please contact us via the contact details set out below.

If you are located in the EEA, UK (inc. Gibraltar) or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the personal information that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the DPF Principles.

VI. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHO WE SHARE IT WITH
We do not sell your personal information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we do share your personal information with third parties as described below. If you have consented to us sharing your personal information but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.
Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You will be able to recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is necessary and related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies. This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information that we collect through the Site and Services. If you have any questions about these practices, please contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
Service Providers
We employ third party companies and people, for example cloud service providers (“Third Party Service Providers”), such as Amazon Web Services, Dropbox, Salesforce and
Unity Technologies
to perform tasks e.g., provide computer and network infrastructure services on our behalf or as advertising exchange partners and we may need to share your information with them to provide products or Services to you. We only share your personal information with Third Party Service Providers to the extent necessary for them to assist us and they do not have any right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We may also work with Google to deliver the best advertising opportunities to its clients through the use of remarketing tags. Traffic Clients and other data subjects can consult Google’s policies to learn more about Google’s processing policies
here
.
Third Party Digital Advertising Partners
If you are a Targeted End User, we will share data about you with Partners, to be used by those Partners for advertising-related purposes, including establishing (on behalf of advertisers) whether to bid on the opportunity to show you ads. When we share data in this manner, we will also share with the relevant Partner details about whether you have consented to, or objected to, the use of your data by the Partner for specified purposes.
Group Companies
We may provide your personal information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf to provide the Site and the Services to you. These parties are required to process such information based on our instructions and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. They do not have any independent right to share this information.
Compliance with laws and legal proceedings
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
Merger or Acquisition
If Liftoff Mobile, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
VII. SECURITY
The security of your personal information is important to us.  Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us
We take appropriate steps to pseudonymize your personal information. For Targeted End Users, the advertising device IDs (which are the only per-user identifiers that we track, and can be reset by the user at any time) are SHA1-hashed before insertion. Since SHA1 is a one-way hashing algorithm, the original raw advertising device ID cannot be reverse-engineered from the hashed version.
If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at DPO@liftoff.io or security@liftoff.io.
VIII. DATA RETENTION
If you have provided us with personal information for the purposes of holding an account with us, we will retain your information (including personal information) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.
If we hold information about you through any other means we shall only process this information for as long as is necessary for the purpose and in any event for no longer than 28 days.
Information relating to Targeted End Users is retained for 30 days in pseudonymized form before it is automatically deleted from our active database. Backups are stored indefinitely.
We will delete it after the timescales stated above, except we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
IX. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
We perform the following automated decision-making processes using your personal information:
To build lookalike targeting models to target users who are similar to the Customer’s existing users. Our Machine Learning does this automatically for every Customer. The more upfront device IDs Liftoff has, the more beneficial this is.
For power predictive ML features e.g. users who have purchased in the past are much more likely to purchase again in the future
To exclude existing users from User Acquisition campaigns, and power targeting rules for re-engagement campaigns e.g. target users who have registered but not purchased.
We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal data is subject to automated decision-making. Our technical and organizational security measures can be provided on request.
When we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contacting us using the contact details provided under Section IV titled “Complaints, Questions and Suggestions”.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
