App Privacy Policy
Short Summary
The App is a photo analysis tool that enables users to analyze portrait photos using advanced neural network technology to estimate the age of individuals depicted in the photos.
To do this, the app uploads the photos you select to
Amazon Rekognition
.
During the analysis on the Amazon Rekognition Cloud servers the photos are temporarily cached and deleted immediately afterwards.
The photos you upload through the App are solely used for the purpose of age detection and are not utilized for any other purposes beyond providing you with the age-detection feature of the App.
Personal Information
Collected Data
When you use the App, we may collect data about you, which may encompass:
Photos
The images you submit while using the App (If you have given us authorization to access your device's camera or camera roll). We only retrieve the specific images you select for analysis within the App; we do not gather your entire photo collection even if you grant us permission to access it. It is important to note that although we do not request or require any metadata associated with the photos you upload, certain metadata (such as geotags) may be automatically attached to your photos. We take measures to remove any metadata associated with the photos you provide through the App.

Our service providers, as well as certain third parties such as online advertising networks and their clients, may also gather this type of information over time and across various third-party websites and mobile applications. We may collect this information directly or through the utilization of third-party software development kits (SDKs). These SDKs may enable third parties to directly collect information from our App.

Your Choices
In this section, we describe the rights and choices available to all users.
Device permissions
You may revoke any permissions you previously granted to us, such as permission to access your camera or camera roll through the settings on your mobile device.
Targeted online advertising
Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on or through the Site or App may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behaviour or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.
Your mobile device settings may provide the functionality to limit our, or our partners’, ability to engage in ad tracking or targeted advertising using the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising associated with your mobile device.
If you choose to opt out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt-out, not all companies that serve online behavioural advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.
Choosing not to share your personal information
Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in order to provide the App to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or you later ask to delete it), we may not be able to provide you with our services. We will tell you what information you must provide to use the App by designating it as required at the time of collection or through other appropriate means.
