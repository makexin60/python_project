GTC SBB FreeSurf.
General Terms and Conditions (GTC) for SBB FreeSurf.
1. Subject matter and area of validity.
These GTC of Swiss Federal Railways (SBB AG), CH-3000 Bern 65, Switzerland, govern the use of SBB FreeSurf by customers.
2. Description of service and costs.
On its national long-distance trains, SBB AG will – where technically, operationally and economically feasible – provide customers with a valid Swiss SIM card from a provider participating in SBB FreeSurf with the service SBB FreeSurf free of charge. The offer is also valid on the lines operated by Schweizerische Südostbahn AG (SOB) within the ambit of cooperation on long-distance services (see synoptic map).
For as long as they are registered with SBB FreeSurf, customers may consume data free of charge via SBB FreeSurf on the device used for registration. Data is consumed exclusively through the customer’s mobile network provider. The relevant contract conditions of the customer’s mobile network provider apply. The partners involved are: Galaxus Mobile, Salt, Sunrise, Quickline and Swisscom. Simultaneous data usage on devices with the same MSISDN that are not being used directly on the train is not permitted.
The quality of the connection depends on the network quality of the customer’s mobile network provider and the individual contract concluded between the customer and his/her mobile network provider. In providing its service, SBB AG does not guarantee the quality of data transmission, speed of data transmission or fault-free operation, as these are directly influenced by circumstances over which SBB AG has no or only limited influence.
Customers have no guarantee that the SBB FreeSurf service will be available on any given train. In particular, SBB AG has the right to block access to SBB FreeSurf at any time without giving a reason. Free use of FreeSurf is only guaranteed after a connection has been established on the train, secured, and confirmed to the customer by an SMS message from the mobile network provider.
The SBB FreeSurf service is not offered on cross-border Swiss trains providing long-distance services after the mobile network provider’s network has been exited. It is possible that this may occur without the mobile network provider sending a message to that effect. If the SBB FreeSurf app is nonetheless used abroad, SBB AG will not cover the costs of data traffic. In order to ensure that no charges are incurred: turn off roaming in settings, data options.
3. Duties and responsibilities of the customer.
The internet may only be used with SBB FreeSurf on a ready-to-use end device (smart phone, tablet/iPad) with a suitable operating system (Android or iOS), provided that a valid Swiss mobile network contract has been concluded with a participating provider and that the “SBB FreeSurf” app has previously been installed. The customer bears sole responsibility for the fulfilment of these requirements.
The customer is not permitted to misuse SBB FreeSurf, i.e. in breach of the agreement or in an unlawful manner, e.g. to operate a server or to offer this service or make it available to third parties in return for payment or other benefits.
Internet services are used at the customer’s own risk. The customer bears sole responsibility for the security of his/her device (which he/she uses to access SBB FreeSurf). The customer has a duty to use the services provided by SBB AG appropriately and in compliance with the law. The contractual terms and conditions applicable between the mobile network provider and the customer (including any general terms and conditions of business) shall continue to apply without amendment, in particular with regard to the usage of internet services. The customer bears sole responsibility for any content published or opinions expressed on the internet.
In the event of any breach by the customer of legal regulations or official orders, the customer shall release SBB AG from all claims brought by third parties against SBB AG as a result of these violations. In such an eventuality, the customer shall hold SBB AG fully harmless, and shall as a general matter be obliged to support SBB AG in good faith in defending against any unjustified claims.
The customer assumes responsibility for ensuring that the device he/she uses and the software installed on it are free of viruses and other malware. The customer is also obliged to immediately deregister his/her device with SBB if it is sold, stolen or otherwise lost. It is possible for the customer to deregister by sending an email, indicating the telephone number, using the contact form on
www.sbb.ch/freesurf
. All registered devices (see also section 4 Registration) will be deregistered.
4. Registration.
The customer must register in order to use SBB FreeSurf (MSISDN/telephone number). Registration is open-ended. Registration is cancelled if no access occurs for six months. The system requires the customer to enter his/her mobile phone number. SBB AG reserves the right to request that individual customers or all customers re-register at any time. The first time he/she logs into the system, the customer will be asked to read and accept these GTC.
5. Data protection.
SBB AG complies with the applicable data protection and telecommunications regulations. In order to be able to provide the service, SBB AG records the MAC address of the end device used by the customer, the mobile telephone number as well as the duration of the connection. SBB AG requires the MSISDN/mobile telephone number in particular in order to rectify any faults. All data are erased after six months. SBB AG shall ensure that no movement profiles are generated. No location data shall be passed on to mobile network providers.
Please note our Privacy Policy
6. Security.
The data traffic generated by the use of SBB FreeSurf operates on the mobile network of the customer’s mobile network provider and is subject to the applicable legal framework conditions. SBB AG cannot guarantee that use of SBB FreeSurf is secured against third-party access to customer data either saved locally on the customer's device or transmitted by the customer while using the service. The customer is responsible for ensuring the security of such data.
7. Liability.
Both SBB AG and the customer shall bear liability for all losses caused to the other party unless the relevant party is able to demonstrate that he/she/it was not at fault. Liability shall be limited to demonstrable loss that has actually been incurred.
SBB AG shall bear liability for the actions of its employees in the same manner as for its own. Liability for personal injury shall be unlimited. Otherwise SBB AG shall not accept any liability unless required otherwise by law. This shall apply in particular for consequential losses (e.g. loss of profit, data loss or damage as a result of downloads) and losses caused by force majeure occurrences.
SBB AG provides exclusively internet access through SBB FreeSurf. In particular, it does not warrant that SBB FreeSurf will work without disruption on all long-distance trains operated by it and SOB at all times and without exception. Accordingly, SBB AG shall not bear liability for losses arising as a result of the fact that SBB FreeSurf was under exceptional circumstances unavailable, did not work, or did not work without disruption on a specific train. SBB AG shall not bear liability for damage to the hardware or software of the end device used by the customer. Unless required otherwise by law, SBB AG shall not bear liability for the authenticity and integrity of the data stored or transmitted through its system or over the internet. Similarly, unless required otherwise by law, no liability shall be incurred for the unintentional disclosure of, damage to, loss of or erasure of data that have been sent/received or stored.
8. Engagement of third parties.
SBB AG may commission third parties to provide its services at any time. In doing so, SBB AG remains responsible for ensuring compliance with the contractual arrangements and legal regulations.
9. Amendments to the GTC.
SBB AG reserves the right to amend these GTC at any time with future effect. This shall apply in particular if the amendment is necessary in order to improve service provision or to prevent misuse owing to a change in the law, technical changes or other developments, or for copyright or other equivalent reasons, provided that the customer is not unreasonably disadvantaged. Any amendment to the GTC will be displayed in the app. The new version must be accepted in order to continue to use SBB FreeSurf.
10. Severability clause.
Should individual provisions of these GTC prove to be invalid or unlawful, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. In this case, the provision concerned shall be replaced by a valid clause that reflects the commercial purpose of the invalid provision as closely as possible.
11. Applicable law and place of jurisdiction.
This contract is governed exclusively by Swiss law. The exclusive place of jurisdiction shall be Bern. The foregoing is without prejudice to any mandatory place of jurisdiction.

Legal framework conditions.
There are clear legal regulations for the use of personal data, to which we refer again and again in this Privacy Policy. They refer to the applicable law in Switzerland and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR).
The applicable law requires us to retain certain data concerning you. At the request of law enforcement or other authorities, we are required to disclose some of this data.
Example:
When connecting to SBB WiFi, we must retain and, if necessary, disclose connection and identification data in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on the Surveillance of Postal and Telecommunications Traffic (BÜPF) and the associated ordinance (VÜPF).
The Federal Act on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Money Laundering Act, AMLA) requires us to retain customer and transaction data for a specific period of time.

Why do we process personal data?
We know how important it is to you that your personal data is handled carefully. All data processing operations are carried out only for specific purposes. These operations may result, e.g. from technical necessity, contractual requirements, legal regulations, an overriding interest, i.e. from legitimate grounds, or from your express consent. We collect, store and process personal data insofar as necessary, e.g. for managing the customer relationship, distributing our products and providing our services, processing orders and contracts, conducting sales and invoicing, replying to questions and concerns, marketing and providing information about our products and services, providing support with technical matters and evaluating and further developing products and services. For detailed information as to what data is processed for which particular purposes, please read the following paragraphs.
The types of data we store and how they are used.
Data when purchasing services.
When purchasing services and products, such as subscriptions or tickets, we require personal data - depending on the product and purchase channel:
The gender, name and date of birth of the passenger or person buying the service or product
A personal photo
Contact details  (e-mail address, address, telephone number)
Customer number
Subscriptions
Payment method
Consent to the General Terms and Conditions
Product details:
The type of product or service being purchased
The price
The place, date and time of purchase
Purchase channel (online, mobile, ticket machine, counter, etc.)
Date of travel or period of validity and departure time
Starting point and destination
To ensure that we can always reach you by post, we check your address – provided you have consented to this at SwissPost – with Swiss Post and update it if necessary.
We use this data to provide you with information that is necessary regarding your contract with us (e.g. renewal information, etc.). In addition, the data is stored in a central database (NOVA) and can be used for marketing and market research purposes if you have consented to this.
The data is used to properly distribute revenues earned from the purchase of tickets among the companies and networks of the National Direct Service.
Furthermore, the data is used in the context of ticket inspection in order to identify the holder of a personalised ticket and to prevent improper use (for more information in this regard, please refer to the section “When inspecting services” and the section on shared responsibility in public transport).
The data is also used for providing our after-sales service in order to identify you and support you in case of issues or problems, as well as to process any compensation claims.
Finally, we evaluate your data in order to further develop the overall public transport system as needed.
If you buy tickets on SBB Mobile, SBB Preview or SBB.ch, the connections get added to your saved journeys so that we can inform you about the journey and suggest alternative routes if necessary. When providing alternative routes, we also take your timetable preferences into account, such as transport of bicycles or accessible travel.
You can save journeys in your timetable search, thereby adding them to your saved journeys manually. Saved journeys are stored for 10 days. You can set whether you would like to receive information of disruptions and transfers for your saved journeys in your profile on SBB Mobile and SBB Preview.
For cross-border journeys, we will notify you by e-mail or SMS about your upcoming journey and any delays or cancellations. You can unsubscribe from these notifications.
For group holidays we require additional information about the group. We will notify you about your group reservation and any delays or cancellations by e-mail or SMS. If you would rather not receive these notifications, you can request this when booking a group journey.
When purchasing services as a business customer via the company portal sbb.ch/business (including the SBB Mobile app), the contractual partner (company) can access all services purchased by its employees for the purpose of internal billing and control processes.
When purchasing services via third-party partners (e.g. municipalities, airlines, third-party websites/apps), these third-party partners can access the services they sell for the purpose of billing and control processes.
Luggage service.
When checking in baggage, the bag must be labelled with name, address and mobile phone number. For online orders, we also need your e-mail address. We need this information so that the baggage can be identified in the event of loss and so that we can contact you about delivery or collection.
Lockers.
When renting a blue locker (digital), we need your e-mail address and mobile phone number in order to send you the collection code and the link to open the locker. Data that must be retained for accounting reasons is deleted after the statutory retention period has expired. In the operational systems, personal data (e-mail address and telephone number) is anonymised after 30 days.
As far as the EU-GDPR applies, our legitimate interest and the contractual performance requirement form the legal basis for this processing of personal data.
When inspecting services.
Customer and subscription data is needed and processed for revenue protection (checking the validity of tickets or reduced-fare tickets, collections and combatting misuse). Therefore, for the purpose of carrying out the entire inspection and collection procedure, the transport companies and networks are authorised to process all data pertaining to travellers or contracting parties (ticket and inspection data, as well as any sensitive data related to all types of travel without a valid ticket, e.g. travellers with invalid tickets or travellers with forgotten tickets or forgotten reduced-fare tickets, and any misuse) and to store this data for the periods specified by data protection law and to exchange this data with other transport companies and networks (including across borders in the case of international tickets and international reduced-fare tickets).
The following provisions apply to individual services or data carriers:
SwissPass card.
When the physical SwissPass card is used as a data carrier, no inspection data is stored (exception: see SwissPass Mobile).
SwissPass Mobile.
When the SwissPass Mobile application is used, the provisions acknowledged when activating SwissPass Mobile are applicable. The following data is processed in this regard: Registration, activation, and inspection data generated when SwissPass Mobile is used. As soon as SwissPass Mobile is used, this data is also collected from the SwissPass card.
Registration data is kept for up to 18 months after either the SwissPass Mobile application is deactivated or the SwissPass card expires. The activation and inspection data from SwissPass Mobile and the SwissPass card is stored on the inspection devices for one day and in the inspection database for 30 days. If misuse is suspected, the maximum storage period for activation and inspection data is 90 days. Travellers who engage in misuse with SwissPass Mobile are suspended from SwissPass Mobile for 12 months. After that period, SwissPass Mobile may be used once again. After another 12 months, the traveller’s suspension file is deleted.
Electronic tickets.
When electronic tickets (e-tickets) are used, inspection data is stored on the central inspection data server at SBB. Tor the purpose of combatting misuse and for measures to prevent misuse and improper refunds, this data is retained for 360 days.
If airlines are the agent or provider of the service (e.g. as part of "SWISS Air Rail"), they can access the control data associated with the service for control purposes.
Where the EU GDPR applies, our legitimate interest and our need to process the Agreement form the legal basis for this processing of personal data.
Data when tickets are misused.
In case of travel without a valid ticket, the data is stored in our own database as well as in a jointly operated register. Travellers or contracting parties acknowledge that if any misuse or forgery is detected, the transport companies are authorised to provide the internal departments affected by the misuse and other transport companies with the relevant personal data so that any misuse can be ruled out or confirmed and any further misuse can be prevented. Pursuant to the Swiss Passenger Transport Act (PBG), different deadlines apply for processing the aforementioned data.

If you choose to pay with a wallet solution, usually you do not have to enter any further payment card information. Only the data required for authorization and transaction processing are transferred via the wallet.

Coupons.
When paying with a coupon, details of the redeemed coupon, the service purchased and/or the person redeeming the coupon may be passed on to the financing partner so that the latter can check whether the coupon has been redeemed by an authorised person.

Disclosure of your data to third parties.
Your data will not be sold by us to third parties.
Your personal data will only be passed on to selected service providers - and only to the extent necessary to provide the service.
These include:
IT support service providers
Issuers of subscription tickets
Shipping service providers (e.g. Swiss Post)
Service providers charged with allocating traffic revenues to the transport companies involved (in particular in the course of drawing up so-called distribution keys within the meaning of the Federal Passenger Transport Act of 20 March 2009 (Personenbeförderungsgesetz, PBG))
Our Hosting Provider
External service providers who process data on our behalf are contractually obliged to comply with the relevant data protection regulations and are not considered third parties under data protection law.
We may be legally required to pass on such information or it may be necessary to pass it on in order to safeguard our rights.
As far as the EU-GDPR applies, our legitimate interest and legal requirements form the legal basis for this processing of personal data.
On our website we use various services provided by Google (Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland). Google already stores information (e.g. your IP address) concerning your use of the website whenever you access any website into which Google services have been integrated. This may also result in the transfer of data to the servers of Google LLC. in the USA. If you are logged in to Google, your information will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish any such data to be associated with your Google profile, you must first sign out of your Google account. Google stores your data (including those relating to users who are not logged in) as user profiles and evaluates them. Collection, storage and evaluation occur on the basis of Google’s legitimate interest in the incorporation of personalised advertising, market research and/or the design of Google websites in order to meet with user requirements. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, and must contact Google in order to exercise this right.
Your personal data will not be disclosed to other parties outside Public Transport. SwissPass partners and companies that have been granted approval to facilitate public transport services based on a contractual agreement are the sole exceptions (as described below). These intermediaries only receive access to your personal data if you wish to purchase a Public Transport service through them and have granted them your consent to access your personal data. Even in this case, they only receive access to your data to the extent necessary to determine if you already have tickets or subscriptions for the planned travel period and they relate to your travel and the third party’s service you have requested. Therefore, your consent forms the legal basis for these data processing operations. You can prospectively revoke your consent at any time (see Section 2.8).
If you take advantage of offers from a SwissPass partner by using your SwissPass, data about any services purchased from us (e.g. a GA, Half Fare or Regional Point-to-Point Travelcard) may be sent to the SwissPass partners to verify whether you can benefit from a specific offer provided by the SwissPass partner (e.g. a discount for GA Travelcard holders). The relevant partner is informed in case of the loss, theft, misuse, forgery or replacement of a card after the purchase of a service. These data processing operations are necessary for implementing the agreement on the use of the SwissPass and are therefore based on this legal ground. For more information, please see the Privacy Policy at swisspass.ch and the privacy policy of the relevant SwissPass partner.

Data transfer within National Direct Service.
As a Public Transport company, we are required by law to provide transport services (“Direct Service” as per Articles 16 and 17 of the Swiss Passenger Transport Act) together with other transport companies and networks. To facilitate this, your data, such as your login, card, customer and service data is shared within the National Direct Service (NDS), an association of over 240 public transport companies and networks, at the national level and stored in central databases.
The individual transport companies and networks are listed here
The data are stored, e.g. in the central NOVA (network-wide public transport connection) database, which is administered by SBB on behalf of the NDS and for which we, together with the other NDS companies and networks, are responsible. NOVA is a technical platform for distributing public transport offerings. It contains all key elements for the sale of public transport services, such as the customer database. The extent to which the individual transport companies and networks can access the shared databased is determined by means of a joint agreement. The disclosure of the data occurring upon their central storage as well as their processing by the transport companies and networks are limited to the following purposes:
Provision of the transport service.
Your travel and purchase data are transmitted within the NDS so that your travel can go smoothly.
Contract implementation.
We process this data for the purposes of commencing, administering, and processing contractual relationships.
Administration of customer relationship and support.
We process your data for purposes related to communicating with you, particularly for answering enquiries, the assertion of your rights and to identify you and assist you as best as possible across the public transport system in case of issues or problems, as well as to process compensation claims.
Ticket inspection and revenue protection.
Customer and subscription data is needed and processed for revenue protection (checking the validity of tickets or reduced-fare tickets, collections and combatting misuse).
Occurrences of travel without a valid (or with a partially valid) ticket can be recorded via the national register of fare dodgers.
National register of fare dodgers
Revenue distribution.
The service centre of Alliance SwissPass, which is managed by ch-integral, performs the legal mandate defined in the Swiss Passenger Transport Act of collecting and processing travel data for the purpose of proper revenue distribution. SBB provides it with the necessary data so that it can fulfil its mandate and further develop revenue distribution. At the same time, the service centre acts as an agent for the distribution of revenues in the National Direct Service on behalf of the member companies of the NDS.
Revenue distribution\
Identification in the context of authenticating your SwissPass login (SSO).
For services that you purchase by using your SwissPass login, the data is then stored in the central customer database (NOVA). To provide you with single sign-on (SSO) access (one login for all applications that enable you to use their services with the SwissPass login), the aforementioned login, card, customer and service data are also exchanged between the central login infrastructure of the SwissPass and us in the course of authentication.
Joint marketing and market research activities.
Furthermore, data collected in connection with the purchase of public transport services are also used for marketing purposes in certain cases. As long as your consent has been obtained and a processing operation is performed or you are contacted for this purpose, it will normally be carried out only by the transport company or network from which you purchased the relevant public transport service. Any processing of data or initiation of contact by the other transport companies or networks that participate in the NDS will only take place in exceptional cases and under stringent requirements and only when the analysis indicates that a particular public transport offering could bring you added value as a customer. One exception in this case is the processing of data and initiation of contact by SBB. SBB carries out the marketing mandate for the services of the NDS on its behalf (e.g. GA and Half Fare) and may contact you regularly in this role. We also process your data for conducting market research, improving our services and developing products.
Public transport services
Further development of public transport systems with anonymous data.
We evaluate your data anonymously in order to further develop the entire public transport service as needed.
Customer information.
For cross-border journeys, we will notify you by email or SMS about your upcoming journey and any delays or cancellations. You can unsubscribe from these notifications. For group journeys, we will notify you via SMS about your group reservation and any delays or cancellations. When reserving a group journey, you yourself can decide if you wish to receive these notifications.
Data transfer to foreign providers of Public Transport.
If you book a cross-border journey, your data will be transferred to foreign public transport providers so that descriptions of available services can be provided, to allow checking of and prevent misuse of tickets, and to notify you in the event of a delay or cancellation.
Data security.
How do we protect your data?
We employ suitable technical and organisational security measures to protect the personal data we store against manipulation, partial or total loss and unauthorised access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.
We also take data protection within SBB very seriously. Our staff and the external service providers working on our behalf are committed to maintaining confidentiality and to complying with data protection provisions.
We will take appropriate precautionary measures to protect your data. However, transferring information over the Internet and other electronic media always entails certain risks, and we cannot guarantee the security of information transferred in this manner.
