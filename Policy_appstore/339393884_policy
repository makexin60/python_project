Privacy Policy for Theodolite and Theodolite HD
Hunter Research and Technology does not collect any personal information or data from devices/users running Theodolite.  However, the app does request certain privacy permissions from iOS, with the following implications:
1) If you authorize Theodolite to use the device camera, it can take photos and record movies which could possibly contain personal information.
2) If you authorize Theodolite to access your device photo album, photos and movies can be saved to your device camera roll.  These photos and movies could possibly contain personal information.
3) If you authorize Theodolite to use your location, that information will be embedded in photos and movies taken with the app, both graphically and via metadata.  That information may also be shared by you to other people through e-mail, SMS, and team tracking features from within the app.
4) If you authorize Theodolite to use your device microphone, movies recorded with the app will contain audio recorded by the microphone.
