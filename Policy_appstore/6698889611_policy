Storing Tracking Technologies
We store Tracking Technologies when you visit or access our Services (for example when you
                are visiting our websites) – these are called "First Party Tracking Technologies".
                In addition, Tracking Technologies are stored by other third parties (for example our
                analytics service providers, business partners and advertisers) who run content on our Services –
                these are called "Third Party Tracking Technologies".
Both types of Tracking Technologies may be stored either for the duration of your visit on our Services or for repeat visits.
Storing Tracking Technologies
There are five main types of Tracking Technologies:
Strictly necessary Tracking Technologies –
These Tracking Technologies are essential to enable you to login, navigate around and use
                        the features of our Services, or to provide a service requested by you (such as your username).
                        We do not need to obtain your consent in order to use these Tracking Technologies.
                        These Tracking Technologies can be used for security and integrity reasons - for example to detect
                        violation of our policies and for support or security features.
Functionality Tracking Technologies –
These Tracking Technologies allow our Services to remember choices you make (such as your language)
                        and provide enhanced and personalized features. For example, these Tracking Technologies are used for
                        authentication (to remember when you are logged-in) and support other features of our Services.
Performance Tracking Technologies –
These Tracking Technologies collect information about your online activity (for example the duration
                        of your visit on our Services), including behavioral data and content engagement metrics. These Tracking
                        Technologies are used for analytics, research and to perform statistics (based on aggregated information).
Marketing or Advertising Tracking Technologies –
These Tracking Technologies are used to deliver tailored offers and advertisements to you, based on your
                        derived interests, as well as to perform email marketing campaigns. They can also be used to limit the
                        number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.
                        They are usually placed by our advertisers (for example advertising networks) and provide them insights about
                        the people who see and interact with their ads, visit their websites or use their app.
Social media Tracking Technologies –
Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook "Like" or "Share" buttons.
                        These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions
                        with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing these features.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.

Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup

, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.

similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.

Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.

the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Privacy Policy URL
Privacy Policy URL
Written by
Sara Pegarella
Widener University School of Law graduate, Managing Legal Editor at TermsFeed.
A Privacy Policy is a legal requirement for all websites and apps that collect or use personal information from users, and your Privacy Policy URL is how you publicly display your Privacy Policy.
Without a Privacy Policy URL, you won't even be able to distribute your app. That's because sites like Facebook and most app stores won't let you go live without a Privacy Policy URL.
Similarly, third party platforms such as website builders and log-in with social media tools will require a Privacy Policy in order to use their services.
This article will break down how to create a Privacy Policy and how to display a Privacy Policy URL
on your website, mobile app, ecommerce platform and on third party sites and services, with examples of each.

Conclusion
What's a Privacy Policy?
A Privacy Policy is a document or statement that outlines all the ways that one party collects and interacts with the personal data of customers and clients.
It will disclose how the business or individual does the following:
Collects personal data
Uses personal data
Discloses or shares personal data
Manages data (storage, deletion, security, etc.)
It will also disclose what rights users have in relation to the above, and any law-specific requirements.
While every Privacy Policy must contain certain information, the specifics will be unique to reflect the actual privacy practices of the business.
For example,
Nordstrom's
Privacy Policy outlines what personal information it collects, but it includes specific things that other businesses may not collect, such as voice and video recordings and payment information:
A Privacy Policy isn't just a good business practice. It's also mandated by
privacy laws across the world
including in the United States, the EU, Canada, the UK, Australia and others.
What's a Privacy Policy URL?
In short, a Privacy Policy URL is the link to the location where your Privacy Policy is posted. Because privacy laws require you to display a Privacy Policy, a great way to comply with this is to provide a URL to your policy somewhere where anyone can locate it and access it at any time.
For example, our Privacy Policy URL is
https://www.termsfeed.com/legal/privacy-policy/
.
Similarly, app developers who want to work with Facebook, Apple or other popular platforms are often required to enter the URL for their Privacy Policy when registering the app.
In most cases, you'll want to host your own Privacy Policy to easily update it and retain control over it. There are two main ways to do this:
Adding the URL as a link in your website footer
Adding the URL as a link within your mobile app's navigation menu and app store listing
How to Generate a Privacy Policy URL
Our
Privacy Policy Generator
will help you create your own custom, legally-compliant Privacy Policy URL in just a few minutes. You can use this URL to display your Privacy Policy anywhere online or within your mobile app.
Our
Privacy Policy Generator
makes it easy to create a Privacy Policy for your business
. Just follow these steps:
At Step 1, select the Website option or App option or both.
Answer some questions about your website or app.
Answer some questions about your business.
Enter the email address
where you'd like the Privacy Policy delivered and click "
Generate
."
You'll be able to instantly access and download your new Privacy Policy
.
Where to Host Your Privacy Policy
Self-hosting is the most common way of hosting a Privacy Policy because it demonstrates a clear correlation between your app or website and your Privacy Policy.
If you're an app developer, you may not already have a dedicated company website. Setting up a simple website to host your Privacy Policy is a good way to go, but there are also other options.
GitHub
allows users to host basic, text-only sites if you're uninterested in creating your own site. You can use this site to house your Privacy Policy text.
Google
(sites.google.com) is another simple place to host a Privacy Policy.
The URL must be public
and accessible by all users, logged-in or not. Don't restrict the URL with a password in any way.

Privacy Policy URL for Websites: Where to Place, and Examples
Let's take a look at a few of the ways you can display your Privacy Policy URL on your website.
Footer
One of the most common ways of complying with privacy laws and getting your Privacy Policy URL out to the public is by
placing it in your website's footer
. People know to look here since it's such a common business practice, and it's typically available from any and all of your site's pages for easy access.
Here's how
The Guardian
does this by including its Privacy Policy URL along with other important URLs in the site's footer:
Simply One Question
follows the same approach but titles its Privacy Policy simply as "Privacy." As long as the word "Privacy" is in the title of the URL, it will be compliant and your users will understand what the URL will be used to access:
King
has its Privacy Policy URL separated from most of the other URLs in the footer, which keeps it distinctive. You want your Privacy Policy URL to stand out at least as much as the other links you provide in your footer:
If your website is created using Wix or WordPress, check out our articles to help you add a Privacy Policy page and link the URL to your site:
How to Add a Privacy Policy to Your WordPress Site
Privacy Policy for Wix
Account Sign-Up/Login Section
If you give users the option to create a personal account with you, you should include your Privacy Policy URL within the form where you request personal information to create the account.
For example, here's how
eBay
provides important URLs in this section:
LinkedIn
takes a similar approach with its Privacy Policy URL displayed on its "Join" form:
Email Newsletter Subscribe Form
The form where you request email addresses is a great place to display your Privacy Policy URL.
Emirates Airlines
includes not one but two URLs to its Privacy Policy in quick succession. The first link is placed carefully under where it collects email addresses, and the second is in the footer itself and displayed across every page.
This really helps the Privacy Policy be conspicuous, which is a requirement of many privacy laws.
Anywhere Your Site Collects Personal Information
You should consider adding a URL to your Privacy Policy to anywhere on your site where you collect personal information. This can include
ecommerce components such as a checkout page, where you collect phone numbers for text message news and updates, on an interactive forum where users can post comments and content
and other similar places.
At the very minimum,
place your Privacy Policy URL in your website's footer
.
Privacy Policy URL for Mobile Apps: Where to Place, and Examples
Displaying your Privacy Policy URL in a mobile app is slightly different than on a website, but the goal is the same: to make sure your users can access the URL at any time, and easily.
There are
3 main locations
that your app's Privacy Policy URL should be displayed:
In your app store listings
Within the app, in a menu
On your app or company website
Let's take a look at these in further detail.
App Store Listing
App stores such as
Apple
and
Google
require that you provide your Privacy Policy URL in order to have your app distributed to the public.
When you register your app with these platforms, you'll be prompted to add your Privacy Policy URL, which will then be displayed to anyone who is looking at your app's listing page.
This is important because users may wish to know what personal information you'll collect from them, and when, before they choose to download your app and hand over their private data.
Here's an example of the
Pocket Casts
Apple App Store listing with its Privacy Policy URL:
Within an App Menu
Since mobile apps don't have a footer like a website does, you'll need to utilize in-app menus to get the same effect of having your Privacy Policy URL available easily and at any point from within the app. The best way to do this is to add the URL to a menu such as a "Legal," "Information," or "About" type of menu.
Here's how
Fitbit
uses its "Account" menu to display a "Legal" link:
From within the "Legal" menu, the Privacy Policy URL is visible:
And when a user taps on the Privacy Policy URL within the app menu, the Privacy Policy opens within the app for easy viewing:
Here's how
Instagram
uses its "Settings" menu to display an "About" sub-menu:
When users tap on "About," they're taken to another sub-menu that displays the Privacy Policy URL:
Users can open the URL directly within the app to view the Privacy Policy at any time from directly within the app:
Remember: While there isn't the same sort of thing as a footer with a mobile app, there are menus and links that are perfect for displaying your Privacy Policy URL.
Your mobile app Privacy Policy URL can either open your Policy within your app, or open a mobile browser window and redirect the user outside of your app and to your main website.
On Your Main Website
If your app or developer has a website, this is a great place to display your Privacy Policy URL. The website footer is the most standard place for displaying it.
You can see how Fitbit's main website includes its Privacy Policy URL in its footer, as is a standard best practice:
Instagram does the same thing:
Privacy Policy URL for Desktop Apps
If you distribute a desktop app that users can download onto a local device, you will need to display a Privacy Policy URL if your desktop app collects or processes any personal information.
The best way to do this is to provide your Privacy Policy URL in 3 places:
On your app's download/information page
Within the app, in a menu
On your app's main website
Desktop App's Download/Information Page
You need to give your potential users a chance to review your privacy practices
before
they download your app and start sharing personal information with you. The perfect way to do this is by displaying your Privacy Policy URL on your desktop app's page in any app store where it's available.
Here's how
Telegram Desktop
does this on the Microsoft App Store:
Within a Desktop App Menu
Your desktop app's menu is an intuitive and effective place to display your Privacy Policy URL.
Here's how Telegram uses its "Settings" menu to display a "Privacy and Security" sub-menu:
Here's how
Netflix
does this on its desktop app:
Users know to look here for important legal information, settings and account details such as a Privacy Policy.
On Your Main Website
Your desktop app likely has a main website for your company, developer firm or just to present more detailed information about the app itself. Make sure you display your desktop app's Privacy Policy URL here, such as in the website footer.
Use the same tips from the previous chapter of this article for displaying your Privacy Policy URL on a website.
Here's how
Telegram
displays its Privacy Policy within its FAQ section:
And here's how Netflix displays its Privacy Policy URL in its website footer:
Privacy Policy URL for Ecommerce: Where to Place, and Examples
If you have an ecommerce website or mobile app, you need to display a Privacy Policy URL. All of the above guidance still stands. There's just one additional thing to do:
Make sure your Privacy Policy URL is displayed somewhere on the checkout page before a user completes an order
.
This helps ensure that users are fully aware that by purchasing from your ecommerce store or app, they are sharing personal information with you such as a mailing address and financial account information.
Here's an example of how you can do this:
While including your Privacy Policy URL in your ecommerce site's footer will make sure that the URL shows up on checkout pages, like in the following example, consider adding it in a more overt way, such as in the first example:
Privacy Policy URL for Other Third Parties
Third parties often require a Privacy Policy URL for you to use their services. Let's look at two common examples of this from Facebook and Google Sign-in features.
Note that this concept is pretty universal and applies well beyond Facebook and Google, so make sure to comply with specific requirements of each third party service you're working with.
Privacy Policy URL for Facebook Page

Log in to your Facebook account and go to your
Facebook Page

Privacy Policy URL
" field.

How to add a Privacy Policy URL to your Facebook app
Facebook requires this because a Privacy Policy is
required by law
if you collect personal information from users.
When you use the APIs from Facebook, you're requesting personal information from users through Facebook. This triggers a number of laws aimed at protecting personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation (
GDPR
).
Don't forget that because you collect personal information from Facebook users, you're not only required to have this legal agreement for your Facebook app, but also have it for your website, mobile app, and so on.
Here's how the
Privacy Policy URL
field looks on your account dashboard, where you need to add the URL to this agreement:
Here's how you can find the Privacy Policy URL field:
Go to the
Facebook for Developers website
.
Click the
My Apps
option in the top navigation menu:
Click on the name of the app you want to add a Privacy Policy to.
Click on
Settings
and select
Basic
:
Add your Privacy Policy URL in the
Privacy Policy URL
field:
If your app is only used to allow users to log in using their Facebook accounts (the "Sign-in with Facebook" functionality), you'll still need to have a Privacy Policy ready as this will appear in the "Login Dialog" permission dialog when users click
Okay
:
If your app is going to appear in Facebook App Store (or App Center), the URL you saved in the dashboard will appear in the profile page of your app:
Please note that Facebook is also requiring you to have a
URL for a Terms of Service agreement
:
While a Terms of Service agreement isn't required by law like a Privacy Policy is, there are a number of good reasons to have one.
Keep your Facebook app compliant by creating and providing these two important legal agreements. It will help protect the legal rights of your customers, make sure your app gets to be distributed without issue, and show that your business is trustworthy and transparent.
Privacy Policy URL for Instagram's API
If your app or website connects to Instagram's API, you must follow the
Facebook/Meta for Developers Platform
Terms by having a Privacy Policy URL.
If you offer a login with Instagram feature, you need to comply with these terms.
Section 4
of this terms agreement addresses the need for a Privacy Policy:
The Privacy Policy must:
Be publicly and easily accessible
Clearly explain what data you process, how and why, and how users can request to have their data deleted
Be available via a link in the Privacy Policy field in the settings of your Instagram App Dashboard, and in any App Store
Make your Privacy Policy URL is
publicly and easily accessible
, and that you include it within your app, within your app's store listing page, and on your main website if you have one.

Always include your Privacy Policy URL in your website's footer, as the
Minimalist Baker
does here:
Here's how
LightWidget
informs users within its Privacy Policy about the data it collects via the Instagram API, how it does so and how it uses the data:
Privacy Policy URL for Twitter Cards
Twitter Cards offers a unique way for you to display your Privacy Policy URL.
In June 2013, Twitter released a suite of tools that allows marketers to add videos, photos and all sorts of media to tweets.
There are currently four Twitter Cards available:
Summary Card
:
This is the default card. It lets you present a small image along with a title and description, with a link to your website. It's a great way to give a little preview of what you're trying to promote, as well as an easy way to access it quickly. Businesses use this to promote a sale, a new blog article or some featured content.
Here's an example of this type of card from Burns Entertainment:
Summary Card with Large Image
:
These cards have a larger image section that helps them stand out more. These can be great for displaying content where the image will be more important, such as an informative graph or a work of art.
Here's an example of a large image summary card from
Bill M Moore
:
App Card
:
This card is perfect for promoting your mobile app while giving users a quick, convenient way to get a direct link to download your app. When users click on the image in this card post, they'll be taken to your app's download page.
Here's an example of an app card from
Round Here Radio
:
Player Card
:
These cards let you embed a video clip within your Twitter post that a user can play from the post itself, then link to the full video or more content if they wish. This is an engaging way to interact with your followers while promoting your content.
Here's an example of a player card from
Tri-Force Consulting
:
Taking advantage of Twitter Cards can help you with lead generation, promoting your brand and advertising your products or services.
They also help you:
Generate more website traffic
Get more followers on Twitter and elsewhere
Enhance the professionalism and effectiveness of your tweets
If you use Twitter Cards, the
Twitter Developer
Policy requires that you
have a legally compliant Privacy Policy on display and available to users
before they can download, install or sign up for your service:
Twitter makes it possible for you to include your Privacy Policy URL on the cards themselves. Doing this helps you comply with Twitter's requirements. It also makes your business look trustworthy and transparent, which can go far in a time where internet scams run rampant.
One of the fields on Twitter's Card Content page will request your Privacy Policy URL:
After you add your Privacy Policy URL to this form and your Card is created, your Privacy Policy URL will be displayed like so:
If you don't want to add a Privacy Policy URL to your Twitter Card, you need to make sure you add the URL on your main website or the app store where your Twitter Card links to. You can see the earlier chapters in this article for tips and guidance on how to add your Privacy Policy URL to websites, apps and app store listings.
When providing your Privacy Policy URL, remember the following regarding your policy itself:
Your Privacy Policy must explain what data is collected, how the data is collected, how it will be used, and what steps are taken to ensure that the data remains secure.
If you start collecting data that's not outlined in your Privacy Policy,
you must update your Privacy Policy
.
The Privacy Policy should be included in the footer section of your website, across all web pages, to make it easier for users and data protection authorities to find.
Privacy Policy URL for Twitter Sign-in
If you use this feature, the
Twitter Developer
Policy requires that you
have a legally compliant Privacy Policy URL on display and available to users
before they can download, install or sign up for your service:
Twitter's
sign-in feature allows people to sign into or create accounts on other websites and mobile apps via the user's existing Twitter account.
This feature helps users access a website or app without needing to take the time to create an additional account for that website. This is very convenient and can help users be more inclined to sign up for your site.
We recommend
two
things to do to satisfy this requirement:
Add your Privacy Policy URL to the screen that offers the Twitter sign-in feature,
and
Add your Privacy Policy URL to your main website's footer.
Privacy Policy for Sign In with Twitter
from
termsfeed
Privacy Policy for Sign In with Twitter
from
termsfeed
Here's an example of how your Privacy Policy URL can be integrated into your Twitter sign-in screen.
YouNow
provides its Privacy Policy URL on its sign in screen, along with a statement that says signing in means the user is agreeing to the Privacy Policy:
When a user clicks the Twitter icon, an authorization page will open where a user is prompted to enter their Twitter username or email address as well as a password to sign in:
You can see how the company's name and website are visible and linked in the upper right corner so someone can quickly access more information about the company, including the company's Privacy Policy.
At the very bottom of this page, there's a note from Twitter that reads, "
We recommend reviewing the app's terms and privacy policy to understand how it will use data from your Twitter account
."
This will help encourage users to seek out further information in a Privacy Policy. It also lets them know that logging in to the company or app website via the Twitter sign-in option means that some of their personal data may be accessed by Twitter.
Here's a slightly different approach you can take, from
Product Hunt
. Its login screen has an option for Twitter, but it doesn't display a Privacy Policy on this pop-up screen:
When a user clicks on the Twitter icon, the authorization page opens, and Product Hunt's Privacy Policy URL is displayed in the upper right near the company's logo, main website URL and Terms agreement:
If you use sign-in with Twitter on your website or mobile app, make sure you have a URL to your Privacy Policy on the page where you offer this sign-in function, or at least on the authorization page near your company's information.
Privacy Policy URL for Google Sign-in
If you use this functionality, you must display a Privacy Policy URL.
The
Google Sign-in
functionality lets people who have Google accounts use their accounts to sign in to other websites that have integrated this functionality.
Privacy Policy for Google Sign-In
from
termsfeed
Privacy Policy for Google Sign-In
from
termsfeed
It's similar in concept to
Facebook Connect
,Twitter Sign In, and others that allow you to use one main account to sign in to multiple different websites, apps and platforms.
Rather than registering individually for all of the websites or apps that a user regularly uses, most websites now conveniently allow users to simply sign in with an account that's already created, such as a Google, Twitter or Facebook account.
For example,
Wave
provides a "Sign In with Google" button on its login page:
If you have a website or mobile app that is being developed to communicate with or integrate with Google services, such as a website or mobile app that supports Google logins, you must follow the requirements of
Google's Platform Guidelines
.
Google's Platform Policy requires that a Privacy Policy is provided to users, that it's adhered to, and that it's not changed
without letting your users know in advance
.
You must clearly disclose what data will be collected shared and used by your website or app when a user uses a Google button
.
Padlet clearly discloses that it will be collecting a name, email address, language preference and profile picture when a user clicks the Google button, while providing a link to its Privacy Policy URL:
Khan Academy
offers a variety of sign-in buttons, including one for Google. It also notes to the left of the buttons that by logging in, a user is agreeing to legal agreements, which are linked to the form and disclose further information:
In sum, if you use Google sign-in buttons, you will need to provide a Privacy Policy URL. You can do this by displaying one on the same page as the Google sign-in button, either in the website footer or as part of the sign-in process noted earlier in this chapter and the chapter on displaying a Privacy Policy URL on websites.
Conclusion
Privacy is becoming a greater concern among both the public and legislative representatives. New comprehensive laws and massive lawsuits prove that privacy matters and failing to comply is costly.
Third parties are also requiring a Privacy Policy URL to use their services or before allowing your mobile app to be distributed.
Make sure you have a Privacy Policy that's easily accessible via a URL and add it to your app, website and any third party app store or platform that requires you to provide it.
The first step to compliance: A Privacy Policy.
Stay compliant with our agreements, policies, and consent banners — everything you need, all in one place.

We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were
mentioned in the news
.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
interested
in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your
settings
allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.

2.2 Premium Services
Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you
opt-out
. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include
TeamLink
and
LinkedIn Pages
(e.g., content analytics and followers).
2.3 Communications
We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication
preferences
at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.

2.4 Advertising
We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn
tag
on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,
groups
participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising
partners
, vendors and
publishers
; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).
Learn more
about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
Learn more
about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our
European Regional Privacy Notice
.
We will show you ads called
sponsored content
which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
Ad Choices
You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings
can be found here
. For Visitors,
the setting is here
.
Info to Ad Providers
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
2.5 Marketing
We promote our Services to you and others.
In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
2.6 Developing Services and Research
We develop our Services and conduct research
Service Development
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct
research
and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
Other Research
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these
jobs
and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under
controls
that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to
researchers
to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
Surveys
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may
opt-out
of survey invitations.
2.7 Customer Support
We use data to help you and fix problems.
We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
We use your
data
to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your
settings
, for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a
post
or LinkedIn
Page
, to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
2.9 Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our
User Agreement
and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
Social Action
E.g. like, comment, follow, share
Partners
Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services
Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
Profile
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a
group
, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your
settings
.
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your
settings
where applicable.
Subject to your
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you
choices
about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
Enterprise Accounts
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
Subject to your
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
3.2 Communication Archival
Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
3.3 Others’ Services
You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
Subject to your
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may
revoke
the link with such accounts.
The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages)
may be available to them on other services
. For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your
settings
), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
3.4 Related Services
We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services.
Where allowed
, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
3.5 Service Providers
We may use others to help us with our Services.
We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
3.6 Legal Disclosures
We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our
Data Request Guidelines
and
Transparency Report
.
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
4. Your Choices & Obligations
4.1 Data Retention
We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data

LinkedIn
account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have
restricted
your account for breach of our
Professional Community Policies
), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache.

We monitor for and try to prevent security breaches. Please use the security features available through our Services.
We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.
