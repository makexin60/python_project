1.3 Scope of data processing, processing purposes and legal bases
The scope of the processing of personal data, the personal data we process, the purposes of processing and the legal bases are explained in detail in the Appendix. The following legal bases may be relied on by us for processing your personal data:
Consent:
Article 6 (1) (a) of UK GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent.
Contract:
Article 6 (1) (b) of UK GDPR is the legal basis insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract, e.g. to fulfil our obligations under the terms of use. This legal basis also applies to processing that is necessary for pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of enquiries about our services.
Legal Obligation:
Article 6 (1) (c) of UK GDPR applies if we fulfil a legal obligation with the processing of personal data, e.g. arising from tax law.
Legitimate Interest:
Article 6 (1) (f) of UK GDPR serves as the legal basis if we can rely on legitimate interests for the processing of personal data, e.g. for the processing of user enquiries.
‚Äç
1.4 Third Party Access
If necessary, we may transfer (or otherwise give access to) your personal data to certain third parties for one or more of the purposes specified in this privacy policy and in particular to the following recipients:
External service providers who provide services to us (including, without limitation, those set out in the Appendix ‚Äì specifically those set out in section ‚ÄòTools from third-party providers‚Äô in the Appendix).
Authorities where required under applicable laws or otherwise.
Partner company or other entities within our corporate group.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
‚Äç
1.5 Data processing outside the UK
Insofar as we transfer your personal data to service providers or other third parties outside the United Kingdom (UK), adequacy decisions of the UK Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO) pursuant to Art. 45 of UK GDPR guarantee the security of the data during transfer, insofar as these exist, as is the case, for example, for countries in the European Economic Area, Andorra, Argentina, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, New Zealand, Israel, and Switzerland.
If no adequacy decision exists, the appropriate safeguard we will usually rely on is the specific standard contractual terms approved for use in the UK which give the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in the UK, namely the International Data Transfer Agreement or the International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Commission‚Äôs standard contractual clauses for international data transfers . Many of the providers have issued contractual guarantees that go beyond the standard contractual clauses and protect the data beyond the standard contractual clauses. These are, for example, guarantees regarding the encryption of the data or regarding the obligation of the third party to inform the data subject if law enforcement agencies wish to access data.
‚Äç
1.6 Storage period
Unless explicit storage periods are specified in this privacy policy, your personal data stored by us will be deleted when it is no longer required for its intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations. If your personal data is not deleted because it is required for other (legally permissible) purposes, its processing will be restricted, i.e. your personal data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to personal data that we must retain for commercial or tax law reasons.
‚Äç
1.7 Rights of the data subjects
As a data subject, you have the following rights vis-√†-vis us with regard to the personal data concerning you that we process:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including carrying out profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right to object.
You also have the absolute right to object any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in one of the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
In particular, you can object to the display of data in your profile (e.g. market value) if you do not want this. We will then delete your profile.
You can exercise the above rights by contacting us using the contact details provided in this privacy policy.
As a data subject, you also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority at any time about the processing of your personal data. The UK‚Äôs data protection authority is the Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO), the UK regulator for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO.
‚Äç
1.8 No obligation to provide data
You are neither contractually nor legally obliged to provide us with personal data. However, if you refuse to provide such personal data that is necessary for the use of the app or that we are legally obliged to collect, you will not be able to use the app or will only be able to use it to a limited extent.
Mandatory information is labelled as such in the app.
‚Äç
1.9 No automated decision-making in individual cases
We do not use fully automated decision-making in accordance with Article 22 of UK GDPR. Should we use such a process in individual cases, we will inform you of this separately.
‚Äç
‚Äç1.10. Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any actual or suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
‚Äç
1.11 Updates
We keep our
privacy
policy under regular review. This version was last updated on Aug 22, 2024.
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us, for example a new address or email address.

Appendix - Specific Data Processing
Downloading the app
Our app is available for download from Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store (hereinafter "Stores"). When you download the app, the required information is transmitted to the stores, in particular your user name, email address and account customer number, time of download, payment information and individual device identification number. We have no influence on this data collection and are not responsible for it. We only process the data to the extent necessary for downloading the mobile app to the mobile device.
‚Äç
Information security
When you use our app, we collect data that is necessary to ensure the stability and security of the app. This is our legitimate interest, so the legal basis is Article 6 (1) (f) of UK GDPR (legitimate interest).
‚Äç
Collection of data & calculation of market values
We collect data about amateur footballers from various sources. These sources include, in particular, our users who upload data and statistics from amateur football to our platform (user-generated content). We also collect data from public sources, such as online platforms, websites and club press releases. The app uses this data to calculate a fictitious market value, which includes the following parameters in particular:
‚Äç
Current & previous league level of the player
Age of the player
Position of the player
Performance data of the team
Performance data of the player
Prematch calculates a fictitious market value for all players in the adult sector (unless they have expressly objected to this). Market values are determined on the basis of various publicly available parameters (if known):
In a first step, a base value is calculated based on the current league level of the players. The higher the league, the higher the respective base value. This base value is then adjusted based on the historical leagues in which the players were active in recent seasons.
In a second step, the team's performance data (goals scored, goals conceded, fair play rating) and the position and age of the players are taken into account. This is based on the consideration that, for example, a young player has greater development potential than an older player and his market value should therefore be higher if the other parameters are the same.
In a third step, individual performance data from the players' last ten matches is then included in the assessment. For all players, it is taken into account whether they were in the squad, were in the starting eleven, how long they played and whether they led the team onto the pitch as captain. In addition, the performance data included differs according to position: for goalkeepers, the goals conceded by the team are included, whereas for strikers, the goals scored are included in the market value.
Our market value has no claim to accuracy or realism, but serves - just like the presentation of the data in our app - solely for the entertainment of our users.
The data is stored on our servers for as long as the player is active and deleted as soon as the player requests the deletion of their data.
The legal basis for data processing is Article 6 (1) (f) of UK GDPR. We are interested in providing our users with an app that is as attractive as possible, including market values for playful performance comparisons.
If you do not agree to the display of data concerning you (e.g. market value) in our app, you can object to this at any time. We will then remove your profile from the app.
‚Äç
User account
You can open a user account in the app. We initially process the personal data requested in this context and displayed in your profile on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) of UK GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to provide you with the functions of the user account.
If you register your user account and agree to our terms of use, the data processing is carried out to fulfil the concluded user contract in accordance with Article 6 (1) (b) of UK GDPR.
As a verified user, you can add further data to your user account on a voluntary basis. You can find more information about this in your user account.
‚Äç
Single sign-on
You can log in to our app using one or more single sign-on procedures. To do this, you use the login details you have already created for another provider. The prerequisite is that you are already registered with the respective provider. If you log in using the single sign-on procedure, we receive information from the provider that you are logged in with the provider and the provider receives information that you are using the single sign-on procedure in our app. Depending on the settings in your account on the provider's website, the provider may provide us with additional information. The legal basis for this processing lies in the user contract between the provider and you.

Wir bei Apple glauben fest daran, dass Datenschutz ein Grundrecht ist¬†‚Äì und dass dieses Grundrecht nicht davon abh√§ngen sollte, wo auf der Welt Sie leben.
Aus diesem Grund behandeln wir alle Daten, die sich auf eine identifizierte oder identifizierbare Person beziehen oder die von Apple mit dieser Person verkn√ºpft oder verkn√ºpfbar sind, als ‚Äûpersonenbezogene Daten‚Äú, unabh√§ngig davon, wo die Person lebt.
Das bedeutet, dass sowohl Daten, die Sie direkt identifizieren¬†‚Äì z.¬†B. Ihr Name¬†‚Äì als auch Daten, die Sie nicht direkt identifizieren, die aber zu Ihrer Identifizierung verwendet werden k√∂nnen¬†‚Äì z.¬†B. die Seriennummer Ihres Ger√§ts¬†‚Äì, personenbezogene Daten sind. Aggregierte Daten gelten im Sinne dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie als nicht personenbezogene Daten.
Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie beschreibt, wie
Apple oder ein Apple Partnerunternehmen
(gemeinsam ‚ÄûApple‚Äú) mit personenbezogenen Daten umgeht, unabh√§ngig davon, ob Sie mit uns auf unseren Websites, √ºber Apple Apps (wie Apple Music oder Wallet) oder pers√∂nlich (auch telefonisch oder beim Besuch eines Apple Stores) interagieren. Apple kann auch Links zu Drittanbietern auf unseren Diensten oder Apps von Drittanbietern zum Download in unserem App¬†Store zur Verf√ºgung stellen. Die Apple¬†Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt nicht daf√ºr, wie Drittanbieter personenbezogene Daten definieren oder verwenden. Wir empfehlen Ihnen, die Datenschutzrichtlinien von Drittanbietern zu lesen und sich mit Ihren Datenschutzrechten vertraut zu machen, bevor Sie mit ihnen interagieren.
Wir bei Apple geben Ihnen die M√∂glichkeit, Auskunft √ºber Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu erhalten, auf sie zuzugreifen, sie zu korrigieren, zu √ºbertragen, ihre Verarbeitung einzuschr√§nken und sie zu l√∂schen. Wir gew√§hren diese Rechte unserem weltweiten Kundenstamm, und wenn Sie sich entscheiden, diese Datenschutzrechte auszu√ºben, haben Sie das Recht, weder diskriminierend behandelt zu werden noch einen minderwertigen Dienst von Apple zu erhalten. Wenn Sie aufgefordert werden, der Bearbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch Apple zuzustimmen, haben Sie auch das Recht, Ihre Zustimmung jederzeit zu widerrufen.
Um Ihre Rechte und Wahlm√∂glichkeiten in Bezug auf den Datenschutz wahrzunehmen, einschlie√ülich der F√§lle, in denen ein Drittanbieter im Namen von Apple handelt, besuchen Sie die Apple Daten- und Datenschutzseite unter
privacy.apple.com
f√ºr Apple oder
shazam.com/privacy
f√ºr Shazam.
Um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu sch√ºtzen, m√ºssen Sie sich bei Ihrem Account anmelden, und Ihre Identit√§t wird √ºberpr√ºft. Wenn Sie eine Kopie Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten w√ºnschen, die derzeit nicht unter
privacy.apple.com
verf√ºgbar ist, k√∂nnen Sie diese unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
anfordern. Sie haben auch das Recht, eine Beschwerde bei der zust√§ndigen Aufsichtsbeh√∂rde einzureichen.
Es kann Situationen geben, in denen wir Ihrer Bitte nicht nachkommen k√∂nnen¬†‚Äì zum Beispiel wenn Sie uns bitten, Ihre Transaktionsdaten zu l√∂schen, Apple aber gesetzlich verpflichtet ist, diese Transaktion aufzuzeichnen. Wir k√∂nnen einen Antrag auch ablehnen, wenn dies unsere rechtm√§√üige Verwendung der Daten zur Betrugsbek√§mpfung und zu Sicherheitszwecken untergraben w√ºrde, etwa wenn Sie die L√∂schung eines Accounts beantragen, der wegen Sicherheitsbedenken untersucht wird. Ihre Datenschutzanfrage kann ferner abgelehnt werden, wenn sie die Privatsph√§re anderer gef√§hrdet, leichtfertig oder schikan√∂s ist oder √§u√üerst unpraktisch oder unangemessen w√§re.
Wenn Sie in Kalifornien leben und keinen Zugriff auf die Apple Seite f√ºr Daten und Datenschutz haben
, k√∂nnen Sie oder Ihr Bevollm√§chtigter unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
oder telefonisch unter +1¬†800¬†275¬†2273 einen Antrag stellen.
Weitere Informationen √ºber die Geltendmachung Ihrer Rechte finden Sie unter
support.apple.com/102283
.
Wir bei Apple sind davon √ºberzeugt, dass wir Ihnen gro√üartige Produkte und einen hohen Datenschutz bieten k√∂nnen. Dies bedeutet, dass wir bem√ºht sind,
nur die personenbezogenen Daten zu erfassen, die wir ben√∂tigen
. Welche personenbezogenen Daten Apple erfasst, h√§ngt davon ab, wie Sie mit Apple interagieren. Erl√§uterungen zum Umgang von Apple mit personenbezogenen Daten f√ºr bestimmte einzelne Dienste finden Sie unter
apple.com/de/legal/privacy/data.
Wenn Sie einen Apple¬†Account erstellen, einen Kredit beantragen, ein Produkt oder Ger√§t kaufen und/oder aktivieren, ein Softwareupdate laden, sich f√ºr einen Kurs in einem Apple¬†Store anmelden, sich mit unseren Diensten verbinden, uns kontaktieren (auch √ºber soziale Medien), an einer Online-Umfrage teilnehmen oder anderweitig mit Apple interagieren, k√∂nnen wir eine Vielzahl von Informationen erfassen, darunter:
Accountdaten.
Ihren Apple¬†Account und zugeh√∂rige Accountdetails, einschlie√ülich E-Mail-Adresse, registrierte Ger√§te, Accountstatus und Alter
Ger√§teinformationen.
Daten, anhand derer Ihr Ger√§t identifiziert werden k√∂nnte, z.¬†B. die Seriennummer des Ger√§ts, oder Informationen √ºber Ihr Ger√§t, z.¬†B. der Browsertyp.

Betrugsbek√§mpfungsdaten.
Daten, die zur Identifizierung und Bek√§mpfung von Betrug verwendet werden, einschlie√ülich einer Vertrauensbewertung des Ger√§ts.
Nutzungsdaten.
Daten √ºber Ihre Aktivit√§ten und Ihre Nutzung unserer Angebote, z.¬†B. App-Starts innerhalb unserer Dienste, einschlie√ülich Browserverlauf; Suchverlauf; Produktinteraktion; Absturzdaten, Leistungs- und andere Diagnosedaten, sowie andere Nutzungsdaten
Standortdaten
. Genauer Standort nur zur Unterst√ºtzung von Diensten wie ‚ÄûWo¬†ist?‚Äú oder, wenn Sie Ihre Zustimmung erteilt haben, f√ºr regionsspezifische Dienste, und ungef√§hrer Standort
Gesundheitsdaten.
Daten, die sich auf den Gesundheitszustand einer Person beziehen, einschlie√ülich Daten, die sich auf die physische oder psychische Gesundheit einer Person beziehen. Zu den personenbezogenen Gesundheitsdaten geh√∂ren auch Daten, die verwendet werden k√∂nnen, um R√ºckschl√ºsse auf den Gesundheitszustand einer Person zu ziehen oder diesen festzustellen. Wenn Sie mit einer App der Apple Health Research Study an einer Studie teilnehmen, ist die Richtlinie zum Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten unter
Apple Health Study Apps¬†‚Äì Datenschutzrichtlinie
beschrieben.
Fitnessdaten.
Angaben zu Ihren Fitness- und Trainingsdaten, wenn Sie diese weitergeben m√∂chten.
Finanzdaten.
Angaben zu Gehalt, Einkommen und Verm√∂gen, sofern erfasst, sowie Informationen zu Finanzangeboten der Marke Apple
Daten mit beh√∂rdlich ausgestellter ID.
In einigen Jurisdiktionen verlangen wir unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen eine von einer Beh√∂rde ausgestellte ID, unter anderem beim Einrichten eines Mobilfunkaccounts und dessen Aktivierung f√ºr Ihr Ger√§t, bei der Beantragung oder Verl√§ngerung von Krediten, der Verwaltung von Reservierungen oder in weiteren gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen F√§llen.
Sonstige Informationen, die Sie uns zur Verf√ºgung stellen.
Details wie der Inhalt Ihrer Kommunikation mit Apple, einschlie√ülich Interaktionen mit dem Kundensupport und Kontakten √ºber Social-Media-Kan√§le
Sie sind nicht verpflichtet, die von uns angeforderten personenbezogenen Daten zur Verf√ºgung zu stellen. Wenn Sie sich jedoch dagegen entscheiden, werden wir in vielen F√§llen nicht in der Lage sein, Ihnen unsere Produkte oder Dienste zur Verf√ºgung zu stellen oder auf Ihre Anfragen zu reagieren.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten √ºber Sie von anderen
Einzelpersonen
, von Unternehmen oder Dritten, die
in Ihrem Auftrag
handeln, von unseren
Partnern, die mit uns zusammenarbeiten, um unsere Produkte und Dienste bereitzustellen und uns bei der Sicherheit und Betrugsbek√§mpfung zu unterst√ºtzen, sowie von anderen
rechtm√§√üigen Quellen erhalten.
Einzelpersonen.
Apple kann Daten √ºber Sie von anderen Einzelpersonen erfassen¬†‚Äì zum Beispiel, wenn diese Person Ihnen ein Produkt oder eine Geschenkkarte geschickt, Sie zur Teilnahme an einem Apple¬†Dienst oder Forum eingeladen oder Inhalte mit Ihnen geteilt hat.
In Ihrem Auftrag.
Sie k√∂nnen andere Einzelpersonen oder Dritte beauftragen, Daten an Apple weiterzugeben. Beispielsweise k√∂nnen Sie Ihren Mobilfunkanbieter beauftragen, Daten √ºber Ihren Anbieter-Account zur Accountaktivierung an Apple weiterzugeben oder Informationen √ºber Ihre Teilnahme an einem Treueprogramm weiterzugeben, damit Sie Pr√§mien f√ºr Apple¬†K√§ufe sammeln k√∂nnen.
Apple¬†Partner.
Im Sinne der Sicherheit und der Betrugsbek√§mpfung k√∂nnen wir die von Ihnen bereitgestellten Informationen durch Dritte √ºberpr√ºfen lassen, z.¬†B. wenn ein Apple¬†Account erstellt wird.
Um Features wie die Suchfunktion zu verbessern und zur Erstellung von Grundlagenmodellen f√ºr KI-Funktionen verwendet Apple den Webcrawler Applebot, um Informationen zu durchforsten, die im Internet √∂ffentlich zug√§nglich sind. Wir haben verschiedene Ma√ünahmen getroffen, um die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir erheben, zu reduzieren. Apple versucht nicht, einzelne Apple Nutzer anhand der durchsuchten Daten zu identifizieren oder Profile √ºber Einzelpersonen zu erstellen. Wir verwenden keine privaten pers√∂nlichen Daten zum Trainieren unserer KI-Grundlagenmodelle. Wenn du dein Widerspruchsrecht in Bezug auf Verarbeitung von Informationen in Anspruch nehmen m√∂chtest, verwende das
Formular f√ºr Anfragen zum Datenschutz von Apple Intelligence
. Weitere Informationen zum Applebot findest du auf der Seite
support.apple.com/120320
.
F√ºr Zwecke der Forschung und Entwicklung k√∂nnen wir Datens√§tze heranziehen, die Bilder oder Sprachaufzeichnungen oder andere Daten, die R√ºckschl√ºsse auf eine identifizierbare Person zulassen, enthalten. Die Erhebung solcher Datens√§tze erfolgt unter Einhaltung des geltenden Rechts, einschlie√ülich des Rechts in der Jurisdiktion, in welcher der jeweilige Datensatz gehostet wird. Bei der Verwendung solcher Datens√§tze f√ºr Forschungs- und Entwicklungszwecke unternehmen wir keinerlei Versuche, die in diesem Material ggf. vorkommenden Personen zu identifizieren.
Apple verwendet personenbezogene Daten, um unsere Dienste bereitzustellen, Ihre Transaktionen zu verarbeiten, mit Ihnen zu kommunizieren, zur Sicherheit und Betrugsbek√§mpfung sowie zur Einhaltung von Gesetzen. Mit Ihrer Zustimmung k√∂nnen wir personenbezogene Daten auch f√ºr andere Zwecke verwenden.
Apple verwendet Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur dann, wenn wir eine g√ºltige gesetzliche Grundlage daf√ºr haben.
Je nach den Umst√§nden kann sich Apple auf Ihre Einwilligung oder die Tatsache verlassen, dass die Verarbeitung erforderlich ist, um einen Vertrag mit Ihnen zu erf√ºllen, Ihre lebenswichtigen Interessen oder die anderer Personen zu sch√ºtzen oder Gesetze einzuhalten. Unter Ber√ºcksichtigung Ihrer Interessen, Rechte und Erwartungen k√∂nnen wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auch verarbeiten, wenn wir der Meinung sind, dass dies in unserem oder dem berechtigten Interesse anderer liegt. Weitere Informationen sind in den produktspezifischen Informationen unserer Produkte und Features wie oben beschrieben eingebettet. Wenn Sie Fragen zur Rechtsgrundlage haben, k√∂nnen Sie sich unter
apple.com/de/privacy/contact
an den Datenschutzbeauftragten wenden.
Bereitstellung unserer Dienste.
Apple erfasst personenbezogene Daten, die zur Bereitstellung unserer Dienste erforderlich sind. Dazu k√∂nnen personenbezogene Daten geh√∂ren, die zur Verbesserung unserer Angebote, f√ºr interne Zwecke wie Pr√ºfungen oder Datenanalysen oder zur Problembehebung erfasst werden. Wenn Sie beispielsweise √ºber ein Apple¬†Music Abonnement auf einen Song zugreifen m√∂chten, erfassen wir Daten dar√ºber, welche Songs Sie abspielen, um Ihnen die angeforderten Inhalte zur Verf√ºgung zu stellen, sowie aus Lizenzgr√ºnden.
Verarbeitung Ihrer Transaktionen.
Um Transaktionen zu verarbeiten, muss Apple Daten wie Ihren Namen, Kauf- und Zahlungsinformationen erfassen.
Kommunikation mit Ihnen.
Um auf Mitteilungen zu antworten, Sie bez√ºglich Ihrer Transaktionen oder Ihres Accounts zu kontaktieren, unsere Produkte und Dienste zu vermarkten, andere relevante Informationen bereitzustellen oder Informationen oder Feedback anzufordern. Gelegentlich k√∂nnen wir personenbezogene Daten nutzen, um wichtige Mitteilungen zu versenden, beispielsweise √ºber K√§ufe oder √Ñnderungen unserer Gesch√§ftsbedingungen und Richtlinien. Weil diese Informationen f√ºr die Beziehung zu Apple wichtig sind, kann man den Erhalt dieser wichtigen Mitteilungen m√∂glicherweise nicht ablehnen.
Sicherheit und Betrugsbek√§mpfung.
Zum Schutz von Einzelpersonen, Mitarbeiter:innen und Apple sowie zum Schutz vor Verlusten und zur Betrugsbek√§mpfung, einschlie√ülich des Schutzes von Einzelpersonen, Mitarbeiter:innen und Apple zum Nutzen aller unserer Nutzer:innen und der Vorabsondierung oder Vorabpr√ºfung hochgeladener Inhalte auf potenziell illegale Inhalte, einschlie√ülich Materials zur sexuellen Ausbeutung von Kindern.
F√ºr Zwecke der Personalisierung verwendete personenbezogene Daten.
Wenn Sie sich daf√ºr entscheiden, Ihre Dienste oder Mitteilungen zu personalisieren, sofern dies m√∂glich ist, verwendet Apple die von uns erfassten Daten, um Ihnen diese personalisierten Dienste oder Mitteilungen anbieten zu k√∂nnen. Weitere Informationen dar√ºber, wie die entsprechenden Dienste personenbezogene Daten zur Personalisierung Ihrer Erfahrungen nutzen, finden Sie in den Datenschutzinformationen, die Sie bei der erstmaligen Nutzung eines Dienstes erhalten, der Sie um Zustimmung zur Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten bittet. Wir stellen diese Informationen leicht auffindbar zur Verf√ºgung, indem wir sie mit unserem Datenschutzsymbol kennzeichnen; sie sind auch jederzeit auf Ihrem Apple¬†Ger√§t und online unter
http://apple.com/de/legal/privacy/data
verf√ºgbar.
Einhaltung von Gesetzen.
Zur Einhaltung des geltenden Rechts¬†‚Äì zum Beispiel zur Erf√ºllung von Steuer- oder Meldepflichten oder zur Erf√ºllung einer rechtm√§√üigen Regierungsanfrage.
Apple verwendet ohne die M√∂glichkeit einer menschlichen √úberpr√ºfung keine Algorithmen oder kein Profiling, um eine Entscheidung zu treffen, die Sie erheblich beeintr√§chtigen w√ºrde. Gem√§√ü kalifornischem Recht verwendet Apple dar√ºber hinaus keine sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten oder legt diese offen f√ºr Zwecke, die von Nutzer:innen verlangen w√ºrden, ein Recht auf Einschr√§nkung der Verarbeitung auszu√ºben.
Apple bewahrt personenbezogene Daten nur so lange auf, wie es f√ºr die Erf√ºllung der Zwecke, f√ºr die sie erfasst wurden, erforderlich ist, einschlie√ülich wie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie oder in unseren dienstspezifischen Datenschutzhinweisen beschrieben oder wie gesetzlich vorgeschrieben. Wir bewahren personenbezogene Daten so lange wie notwendig auf, um die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und unseren dienstspezifischen √úbersichten zum Datenschutz beschriebenen Zwecke zu erf√ºllen. Bei der Beurteilung der Aufbewahrungsfristen pr√ºfen wir zun√§chst sorgf√§ltig, ob es notwendig ist, die erfassten personenbezogenen Daten aufzubewahren, und bewahren, falls eine Aufbewahrung erforderlich ist, die personenbezogenen Daten f√ºr den k√ºrzesten gesetzlich zul√§ssigen Zeitraum auf.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten an
Apple¬†Partnerunternehmen
,
Dienstleister,
die in unserem Auftrag handeln, an unsere
Partner
,
Entwickler und Herausgeber
, oder andere
in Ihrem Auftrag t√§tige Parteien weitergeben
. Dar√ºber hinaus gibt Apple personenbezogene Daten nicht an Dritte f√ºr deren eigene Marketingzwecke weiter.
Dienstleister.
Apple ist berechtigt, Drittparteien als unsere Dienstleister zu beauftragen und bestimmte Aufgaben in unserem Namen ausf√ºhren zu lassen, zum Beispiel Verarbeitung oder Aufbewahrung von Daten einschlie√ülich personenbezogener Daten im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Nutzung unserer Dienste und der Lieferung von Produkten an unsere Kund:innen. Apple¬†Dienstleister sind verpflichtet, personenbezogene Daten in √úbereinstimmung mit dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und gem√§√ü unseren Anweisungen zu verarbeiten. Sie d√ºrfen die von uns weitergegebenen personenbezogenen Daten nicht f√ºr ihre eigenen Zwecke verwenden und m√ºssen die personenbezogenen Daten l√∂schen oder zur√ºckgeben, sobald sie unseren Auftrag erf√ºllt haben.
Partner.
Gelegentlich geht Apple Partnerschaften mit Drittanbietern ein, um Dienste oder andere Angebote bereitzustellen. Beispielsweise werden finanzielle Angebote von Apple wie Apple¬†Card und Apple¬†Cash von Apple und unseren Partnern angeboten. Apple verlangt von seinen Partnern, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu sch√ºtzen.
Von Ihnen abonnierte Entwickler und Herausgeber.
Wenn Sie im App¬†Store oder in Apple¬†News ein Abonnement eines Dritten erwerben, erstellen wir eine f√ºr Sie und den Entwickler oder Herausgeber eindeutige Abonnenten-ID. Die Abonnenten-ID kann verwendet werden, um Berichte an den Entwickler oder Herausgeber zu senden, die Informationen √ºber das von Ihnen erworbene Abonnement und Ihr Wohnsitzland enthalten. Wenn Sie alle Ihre Abonnements bei einem bestimmten Entwickler oder Herausgeber k√ºndigen, wird die Abonnenten-ID nach 180 Tagen zur√ºckgesetzt, sofern Sie kein neues Abonnement abschlie√üen. Diese Informationen werden Entwicklern oder Herausgebern bereitgestellt, damit sie einen √úberblick √ºber den Stand ihrer Abonnements haben.
Sonstige.
Apple kann personenbezogene Daten in Ihrem Auftrag oder mit Ihrer Zustimmung an andere weitergeben, z.¬†B. wenn wir Informationen an Ihren Mobilfunkanbieter weitergeben, um Ihren Account zu aktivieren. Au√üerdem k√∂nnen wir Daten √ºber Sie offenlegen, wenn wir der √úberzeugung sind, dass dies f√ºr die nationale Sicherheit, den Gesetzesvollzug oder andere √∂ffentliche Interessen notwendig oder angemessen ist. Wir k√∂nnen auch Daten √ºber Sie offenlegen, wenn es daf√ºr eine gesetzliche Grundlage gibt, wenn wir feststellen, dass die Offenlegung notwendig ist, um unsere Allgemeinen Gesch√§ftsbedingungen durchzusetzen oder unseren Gesch√§ftsbetrieb oder unsere Nutzer:innen zu sch√ºtzen, oder im Falle einer Umstrukturierung, Fusion oder eines Verkaufs.
Apple verkauft Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht, auch nicht gem√§√ü der Definition von ‚ÄûVerkauf‚Äú in Nevada und Kalifornien. Dar√ºber hinaus ‚Äûteilt‚Äú Apple Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht gem√§√ü Definition dieses Begriffs in Kalifornien.
Wir bei Apple glauben, dass guter Datenschutz auf hoher Sicherheit beruht. Wir verwenden
administrative, technische und physische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen
, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten unter Ber√ºcksichtigung der Art der Daten und der Verarbeitung sowie der Bedrohungen zu sch√ºtzen. Wir entwickeln diese Sicherheitsvorkehrungen st√§ndig weiter, um den Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu gew√§hrleisten. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in unserem Leitfaden
Sicherheit der Apple Plattformen
.
Apple ist sich der Bedeutung des Schutzes der personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern bewusst. Als Kinder definieren wir
Personen unter 13¬†Jahren oder einem entsprechenden in Ihrer Rechtsordnung gesetzlich festgelegten Alter
. Aus diesem Grund hat Apple zus√§tzliche Verfahren und Schutzma√ünahmen implementiert, um die personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern zu sch√ºtzen.
Um auf bestimmte Apple¬†Dienste zugreifen zu k√∂nnen, muss ein Kind einen Apple¬†Account besitzen. Ein Apple¬†Account f√ºr ein Kind kann durch einen
Elternteil
oder, im Falle eines verwalteten Apple¬†Accounts, durch die
Bildungseinrichtung des Kindes
erstellt werden.
Eltern.
Um einen Kinderaccount zu erstellen, m√ºssen Eltern die
Informationen unter Familien-Datenschutzauskunft f√ºr Kinder
lesen. Darin wird beschrieben, wie Apple mit den personenbezogenen Daten von Kindern umgeht. Bei Zustimmung muss ein Elternteil Apple eine nachpr√ºfbare elterliche Zustimmung vorlegen.
Bildungseinrichtungen.
Bildungseinrichtungen, die am Apple¬†School¬†Manager¬†Programm teilnehmen, k√∂nnen auch Apple¬†Accounts f√ºr Lernende erstellen, sogenannte ‚Äûverwaltete Apple¬†Accounts‚Äú. Diese Einrichtungen m√ºssen der Vereinbarung
Verwaltete Apple¬†Accounts f√ºr Lernende
zustimmen, die als Anhang A des Apple School Manager Vertrags enthalten ist.
Wenn wir erfahren, dass die personenbezogenen Daten eines Kindes ohne entsprechende Genehmigung erfasst wurden, werden sie schnellstm√∂glich gel√∂scht.
Um von Ihren Datenschutzrechten f√ºr die Informationen Ihres Kindes Gebrauch zu machen, besuchen Sie die Apple Seite f√ºr Daten und Datenschutz unter
privacy.apple.com
, und melden Sie sich beim Account des Kindes an.
Auf den Websites, in Onlinediensten, interaktiven Anwendungen und Werbematerialien von Apple werden m√∂glicherweise
‚ÄûCookies‚Äú und andere Technologien
wie etwa Webbeacons verwendet.
Diese Technologien erlauben uns, das Nutzerverhalten, u.¬†a. f√ºr Sicherheit und Betrugsbek√§mpfung, besser zu verstehen, informieren uns, welche Teile unserer Websites besucht wurden und vereinfachen und messen die Effizienz von Werbung und der Websuchen.
Kommunikations-Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden verwendet, um den Netzwerkverkehr von und zu den Systemen von Apple zu erm√∂glichen, einschlie√ülich des Erkennens etwaiger Fehler.
Absolut notwendige Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden bei Bedarf gesetzt, um eine bestimmte Funktion oder einen bestimmten Dienst bereitzustellen, auf die/den Sie zugegriffen oder die/den Sie angefordert haben. Sie erm√∂glichen es uns zum Beispiel, unsere Websites im richtigen Format und in der richtigen Sprache anzuzeigen, Ihre Transaktionen zu authentifizieren und zu verifizieren und den Inhalt Ihres Einkaufswagens zu speichern, wenn Sie online auf
apple.com/de
einkaufen.
Sonstige Cookies.
Diese Cookies werden verwendet, um zu verstehen, wie Besucher:innen mit unseren Websites und Online-Diensten interagieren, u.¬†a. indem sie uns helfen, die Wirksamkeit von Werbung und Websuchen zu beurteilen. Apple verwendet diese Cookies auch, um die von Ihnen beim Browsen getroffenen Entscheidungen zu speichern, damit wir Ihnen ein individuelles Erlebnis bieten k√∂nnen.
Wenn Sie es vorziehen, dass Apple keine Cookies verwendet, haben Sie die M√∂glichkeit, deren Verwendung zu deaktivieren. Wenn Sie Cookies deaktivieren m√∂chten und den Webbrowser Safari verwenden, w√§hlen Sie in den Datenschutzeinstellungen von Safari ‚ÄûAlle Cookies blockieren‚Äú. Wenn Sie einen anderen Browser verwenden, k√∂nnen Sie sich bei Ihrem Anbieter erkundigen, wie sich Cookies deaktivieren lassen. Bestimmte Funktionen der Apple¬†Website sind m√∂glicherweise nicht verf√ºgbar, wenn alle Cookies deaktiviert sind.
Zus√§tzlich zu Cookies verwendet Apple andere Technologien, die uns helfen, √§hnliche Ziele zu erreichen.
In einigen E-Mail-Nachrichten, die Apple an Sie sendet, geben wir eine ‚ÄûClick-through-URL‚Äú an, √ºber die Sie auf Inhalte auf der Apple¬†Website weitergeleitet werden. Wenn Sie auf diese URLs klicken, werden Sie durch einen separaten Webserver geleitet, bevor Sie zur Zielseite auf unserer Website gelangen. Wir verfolgen diesen ‚ÄûClick-through‚Äú, um das Interesse an bestimmten Themen zu ermitteln und zu messen, ob wir effektiv mit Ihnen kommunizieren. Wenn Sie nicht m√∂chten, dass solche Daten erfasst und nachverfolgt werden, klicken Sie in E-Mails nicht auf Grafik- oder Text-Links.
Apple behandelt Daten, die wir mit diesen Cookies und √§hnlichen Technologien erfassen, im Allgemeinen als nicht personenbezogene Daten.
In dem Ausma√ü, zu dem Internet-Protokolladressen (IP-Adressen) oder √§hnliche Identifizierungsmerkmale durch anwendbares Recht als personenbezogene Daten eingestuft werden, behandeln wir diese Identifizierungsmerkmale ebenfalls als personenbezogene Daten. Dar√ºber hinaus kombiniert Apple manchmal nicht personenbezogene Daten, die mit diesen Technologien erfasst wurden, mit anderen personenbezogenen Daten, die Apple aufbewahrt. Wenn wir Daten auf diese Weise kombinieren, behandeln wir die kombinierten Daten f√ºr die Zwecke dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie als personenbezogene Daten.
Anzeigen, die √ºber die Werbeplattform von Apple bereitgestellt werden, k√∂nnen in App Store, in Apple News, in der App ‚ÄûAktien‚Äú und in der Apple¬†TV¬†App angezeigt werden. Die Werbeplattform von Apple verfolgt Sie nicht, was bedeutet, dass sie keine Nutzer- oder Ger√§tedaten, die von unseren Apps erfasst wurden, mit Nutzer- oder Ger√§tedaten verkn√ºpft, die von Dritten f√ºr zielgerichtete Werbe- oder Werbemessungszwecke erfasst wurden, und keine Nutzer- oder Ger√§tedaten an Datenvermittler weitergibt.
Wenn Sie in diesen Apps keine auf Ihre Interessen zugeschnittene Werbung von der Apple¬†Werbeplattform erhalten m√∂chten, k√∂nnen Sie ‚ÄûPersonalisierte Werbung‚Äú deaktivieren. Damit deaktivieren Sie derartige Werbung f√ºr Ihren Apple¬†Account¬†‚Äì unabh√§ngig vom verwendeten Ger√§t. Auf Ihrem iOS, iPadOS oder visionOS Ger√§t k√∂nnen Sie ‚ÄûPersonalisierte Werbung‚Äú deaktivieren, indem Sie ‚ÄûEinstellungen‚Äú > ‚ÄûDatenschutz & Sicherheit‚Äú > ‚ÄûApple Werbung‚Äú w√§hlen und auf ‚ÄûPersonalisierte Werbung‚Äú tippen, um sie zu deaktivieren. Auf Ihrem Mac k√∂nnen Sie ‚ÄûPersonalisierte¬†Werbung‚Äú deaktivieren, indem Sie ‚ÄûSystemeinstellungen‚Äú > ‚ÄûDatenschutz & Sicherheit‚Äú > ‚ÄûDatenschutz‚Äú > ‚ÄûWerbung‚Äú w√§hlen und auf ‚ÄûPersonalisierte¬†Werbung‚Äú tippen, um sie zu deaktivieren. Sie sehen unter Umst√§nden dennoch kontextbasierte Werbung im App¬†Store oder bei Apple¬†News und Aktien auf der Basis Ihrer Suchanfrage oder des Channels, den Sie lesen. Wenn Sie ‚ÄûApps erlauben, Tracking anzufordern‚Äú deaktivieren, k√∂nnen Apps von Drittanbietern nicht auf die Anzeigenkennung zugreifen (eine nicht personenbezogene Kennung, die vom Betriebssystem auf Ihrem Ger√§t bereitgestellt wird), um Sie √ºber Apps und Websites anderer Unternehmen nachzuverfolgen.
Weitere Informationen zur von Apple bereitgestellten Werbung und zum Datenschutz finden Sie unter

Die Produkte und Angebote von Apple verbinden Sie mit der Welt. Um dies zu erm√∂glichen,
k√∂nnen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Einrichtungen auf der ganzen Welt,
einschlie√ülich Apple¬†Partnerunternehmen, √ºbertragen oder von diesen eingesehen werden, um Verarbeitungsaktivit√§ten durchzuf√ºhren, wie sie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie in Verbindung mit Ihrer Nutzung unserer Produkte und Dienste beschrieben werden. Apple h√§lt sich an die Gesetze zur √úbermittlung personenbezogener Daten zwischen L√§ndern, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Daten an jedem Ort stets gesch√ºtzt sind.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you‚Äôre signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we‚Äôve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users ‚Äî from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you‚Äôll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you‚Äôre not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you‚Äôre using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you‚Äôre signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren‚Äôt signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information ‚Äî like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers ‚Äî for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you‚Äôre using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you‚Äôre using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you‚Äôve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that‚Äôs saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you‚Äôre using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device‚Äôs location on or off
using the device‚Äôs settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google‚Äôs Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google‚Äôs services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services ‚Äî for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google‚Äôs first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you‚Äôve already installed and videos you‚Äôve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for ‚Äúmountain bikes,‚Äù you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don‚Äôt show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don‚Äôt show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don‚Äôt share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the ‚Äútap to call‚Äù button, we‚Äôll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we‚Äôll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google‚Äôs services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We‚Äôll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn‚Äôt covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products ‚Äî you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether

rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you‚Äôre signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We‚Äôll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we‚Äôll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We‚Äôll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.

Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google‚Äôs audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our

specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we‚Äôll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information

managed
in your device‚Äôs settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device‚Äôs unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you‚Äôre signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account‚Äôs Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like ‚ÄúHey Google,‚Äù Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
