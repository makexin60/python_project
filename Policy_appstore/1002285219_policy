Philips Sonicare for Kids Privacy Notice
This Privacy Notice was last updated on 19th January 2021.
The Philips Sonicare for Kids app (“App”) helps parents to improve and monitor their children's brushing habits and provides them with personalized brushing information based on their children's brushing data ("Services").
The App uses personal data collected or processed by the Philips Sonicare for Kids Toothbrush Handle with Bluetooth connection ("Device") and/or the App. The controller of your personal data under this Privacy Notice is Philips Oral Healthcare, LLC, with address at 22100 Bothell Everett Highway, Bothell WA 98021, USA ("Philips", "our", "we" or "us").
This Privacy Notice applies to the personal data collected by the App and the Device. The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to help you understand our privacy practices when you use our Services, including what data we collect, why we collect it and what we do with it, as well as your individual rights.
Please also read our Cookie Notice and Terms of Use, which describe the terms under which you use our Services.
What Information and Personal Data are collected and for which Purposes
We receive or collect information and personal data, as described in detail below, when we provide our Services, including when you access, download and install the App.
Sensitive Analytics Data
If you provide consent, we collect analytics data on your child’s brushing habits and App usage, including toothbrush type (manual, electric or sonicare), brush handle data (model number, serial number, firmware version, manufacturer), brushing duration, brushing start time and intensity (“Brushing Data”).  We use and/or aggregate the Brushing Data for analytical purposes to improve the App and the Services, including improving your child’s general App experience, the games and graphics of the App, and the performance of the Device. Philips always ensures that the processing of the Brushing Data is subject to appropriate data protection safeguards. Among others, Philips associates the Brushing Data with a random identifier and replaces any IP address associated with the Brushing Data with a generic IP address before storage.
Before collecting any sensitive data, we will inform you and ask your explicit consent in accordance with article 9.2.a. of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Other than provided above, we ask you not to send or disclose any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, philosophical or other beliefs, health, sex life or sexual orientation, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) to us, on or through the App, or by any other means.
If you do not provide consent, Philips will not process the Brushing Data in any manner. In this case, the Brushing Data will remain stored in the App on your mobile device, where Philips will not have access to it. You will be in control of this data. If you delete your child’s profile and/or the App, the Brushing Data will be deleted from your mobile device.

In this case, your social media provider may collect information on the fact that you are using the App and logging in using your social media account.
