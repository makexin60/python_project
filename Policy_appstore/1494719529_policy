CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION
You have certain choices about how we use your information. Certain choices you make are browser and device specific.
Your Privacy Rights:
If you do not want to share your information, you can choose not to participate in a particular service or activity.
For your options regarding cookies and other tracking technologies, see our
Cookie Policy
.
You can request further details about the personal information we collect about you; access to, rectification of or deletion of certain personal information; or to restrict or opt-out of using or sharing your personal information in certain circumstances.
You may be able to access, update, change or delete some of your information by logging into your account. If you cannot request your desired option through your account, please contact us at
privacy@transactcampus.com
or at the telephone number or address listed below. You may also submit your request through our “Contact Us” page.  Please do not send us any sensitive personal information using email. Email transmissions are not secure.
Note that we may take steps to verify your identity before processing your request. Where required by law, we may accept a privacy request from someone acting on your behalf; however, we may still contact you to verify that this individual is authorized to make the request for you.
If you have questions about the privacy practices of our Clients, we recommend that you please contact them directly

Exercising Your CCPA Rights
Amendments to the CCPA provides exemptions to the Right to Know and Right to Delete for personal information (i) between a business and a person who is acting as an employee, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, nonprofit, or government where the information is used in the context of a business transaction; and (ii) that a business collects about job applicants and employees.  These exemptions are currently set to expire on January 1, 2023.  Until that date, we will not respond to requests to know or delete that meet either of these two exemptions.  We do not sell your information to third parties for monetary consideration.  However, if a transfer of information for advertising purposes is considered a Sale under the CCPA, you can disable that sharing by disabling the applicable cookies through our Cookie Policy.
