third party
site or service and this Privacy Notice will no longer apply

We participate in interest-based
                advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your

                other websites, apps or services you may use (including Facebook), and on other devices you may

These third parties may collect

We and our
third party
partners may also link your various devices so that content
                you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We do this by collecting
                information about each device you use when you are logged in to the

                user ID) with third party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices. We and our partners
                can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to
                you across your devices, to perform analytics and to measure the performance of our advertising
                campaigns.

                receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s and DAA’s or Your Online Choices online resources
                will only opt you out from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but you may
                still receive interest-based ads on your other devices. You would need to perform the opt-out on each
                browser or device you use.
Some of these opt-outs may not
                be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser
                settings, switch browsers or devices, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out
                again.
Please note that opting out of
                interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see advertising on your device – it just
                means that adverts may no longer be tailored to your interests.
4. YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR
                    INFORMATION
We will retain your information
                for as long as needed to provide you the functionalities of the
Facemoji
App and
Facemoji
Keyboard and for thirty days thereafter for the purpose of
                analyzing or further improving our technology, the
Facemoji
App and
Facemoji
Keyboard, after which the personal information will be
                deleted or anonymized.
You may control the
Facemoji
App and
Facemoji
Keyboard’s access to your device information through your
                “Settings” app on your device. For instance, you can disable the
Facemoji
Keyboard's access to your microphone, photo stream and
                camera roll.
You can also control the
                information that we receive at any time by changing your settings in the
Facemoji
App (by turning off the "share data" toggle in Settings >
                Input Settings) or by disabling "Full Access" through your device's settings. Note that certain features
                require personal information input to function and the overall effectiveness of the
Facemoji
Keyboard or various other
features
and functionalities may deteriorate or be disabled if you
                decide to turn-off data sharing. For instance, if you turn off data sharing, it may affect the word
                prediction functionality of the
Facemoji
Keyboard,
the translation functionality of the
Facemoji
Keyboard or your ability to customize certain elements of
                the
Facemoji
Keyboard like fonts and key sounds.

                and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers.
