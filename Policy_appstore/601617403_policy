If you access such a third-party website through a link we provide, you will be subject to the privacy policy of the new site. Alo Moves is not responsible for the contents of any linked webpages referenced from our website. If you have any questions regarding the privacy, security, or content of those sites, you should contact the appropriate contact(s) at those websites directly.

Consent to International Transfer and Disclosure of Personal Information:
Alo Moves is located in the United States (“U.S.”) and is subject to the applicable laws of the United States (where data privacy laws are less stringent than in the European Union and certain other jurisdictions). We will store and process information we receive about you, as described in this Privacy Policy, in the U.S.
We are involved in business activities in a variety of countries. You agree that Alo Moves and those with whom we share your personal information (“Recipients”) may disclose, transfer, process, and store your personal information outside of your country of origin to our affiliates, sponsors and partners, and any other third-party service providers for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Some of the recipients of personal information as specified above may be located in countries that do not provide a level of data protection equivalent to that set forth by the European Union and some other jurisdictions. If you submit any personal information or choose to access or use the Services offered by Alo Moves such as our website, you consent to such disclosure, transfer, process, and storage of information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and subject to such applicable laws which may include access by law enforcement and other government entities including courts and tribunals. If we do transfer personal information outside the U.S., we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if it were being used in the U.S. We will use one of the following legally recognized safeguards to protect your information:
Transfer the data to a non-EEA country that has privacy laws at least as protective as those within the EEA, or
Put in place a contract with the recipient of the data, which means the recipient must protect the data to the same standards as required within the EEA.

You may also manage, update and correct the information you provide as part of your online account by logging into your user account and clicking on the “Settings” hyperlink. If you choose not to give us certain personal information, you can still use many aspects of our website. However, you will not be able to access website areas that require account registration.
