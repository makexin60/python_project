Application analytics
Hankinsoft Developement apps may include analytics (via AppCenter.ms). If analytics are included, they may be disabled within any of our applications. Analytics are not shared and are used to determine which features are being used and what future development should focus on. All application analytics are anonymous.
Website analytics
Website analytics are provided via Google Analytics. Website analytics are used to determine visitor sources.
Crash Logs
Crash logs are provided by AppCenter.ms. If an application crashes, the crash log will contain information such as the apps current state, memory usage and generic device details such as version, type (iPad, iPhone, mac, etc). No personal information is provided.
iCloud Keychain
iCloud Keychain is used to store some information such as connection details. This allows the information to be available on multiple macOS and iOS devices under the users control.
Updates
Some of our macOS applications will ping hankinsoft.com or associated websites on startup to check if they are running the latest version. The check contains only information about the current application version and returns only information about the latest available version.
Email
Some of our websites provide you the option to subscribe to our mailing list. All email addresses are stored within MailChamp. Honestly, there is no reason to subscribe as we have never sent out a newsletter.
