XII. SPECIAL RULES CONCERNING THE PROCESSING OF THE DATA OF PASSENGERS TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES
Due to the fact that the Passengers of PLL LOT travel between the European Union and the United States, below we present special rules concerning the processing of their personal data
PLL LOT, according to US law and the international agreement between the European Union and the United States, will transfer PNR data to the United States Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter referred to as ”DHS”). This data shall be transferred for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
PLL LOT will transfer the Passenger’s data collected before the travel (Advance Passenger Information – API i.e. in particular information from the Passenger’s passport that are collected during the check-in) to border control authorities. This data shall be transferred for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
In order to obtain exhaustive explanations on the manner of handling PNR data concerning flights between the European Union and the United States by DHS, one can become acquainted with the obligations of the United States Department of Homeland Security ("PNR Obligations") published in the US Federal Register vol. 64, No. 131, page 41543.
PNR data received in connection with flights between the EU and the USA may be made available to other domestic and foreign governmental authorities responsible for combatting terrorism or law enforcement for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
Some PNR data belonging to special categories of data within the meaning of 9 GDPR can be entered in the PNR if they are transferred to DHS from community booking systems or air carriers departure control. Such PNR data, which belong to special categories of data, include in particular, certain information on the Passenger’s racial or ethnic origin, their political views, religious convictions, health condition or sexual orientation. DHS has undertaken not to use any PNR data belonging to special categories of data, which they receive from booking systems or air carriers departure control in the EU. DHS has launched an automatic filtering program, preventing the use of PNR data belonging to the category of special PNR data.
PNR data from flights between the EU and the USA will be stored by DHS for 3 years and six months, unless DHS, during this time, makes manual access to this particular PNR data. In such cases, PNR data will be stored in DHS for an additional period of eight years. Moreover, information related to particular enforcement records will be kept in DHS by the time such a record is archived.
The obligation to ensure that all DHS departments handle personal information in accordance with the relevant act rests with the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security. This Officer is independent from all DHS directorates, and their findings are binding for the entire department. In order to ensure that DHS strictly follows provisions and uses proper safety measures, they will exercise general supervision over the program.
Every passenger may demand from DHS additional information on the type of PNR Data made available to DHS and ask to be issued a copy of data included in DHS database. To the extent it is permitted by the Freedom of Information Act and other statutory and implementing provisions and political objectives, regardless of the Passenger’s nationality or place of residence, DHS will consider the request concerning documents, including also PNR documents possessed by DHS. DHS can refuse to disclose or postpone the disclosure of all PNR data or part of them in certain circumstances (e.g. if there are reasons to expect that it will disrupt pending legal proceedings or cause a disclosure of techniques and procedures used during investigations conducted by law enforcement authorities). If DHS refuses access to PNR data under the departures set out in the Freedom of Information Act, there is a possibility to lodge an appeal from this decision by virtue of administrative procedure to the Chief Privacy Officer in DHS, who on behalf of DHS is responsible for both privacy protection and data disclosure rules. The final decision is actionable in court under the provisions of US law.
Passengers may demand rectification of their PNR data included in DHS databases, contacting the following offices. DHS will take into account these rectification requests which they find justified and property substantiated.
Enquiries concerning PNR data made available to DHS or requests for making data possessed by DHS and relating to the requesting party available should be sent in writing to: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229. Further information concerning the procedures of submitting such requests can be found in section 19 Code of Federal Regulations, section 103.5. If someone wants to report a problem or complaint concerning PNR data or submit a request for their correction, this can be done in writing to the address: Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229. Decisions of DHS are subject to verification of the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528. Any enquiries, complaints or requests for the rectification of PNR data can be also addressed to a data protection authority in the EU member state of a given Passenger for possible further examination.
If the complaint cannot be settled by DHS, the person submitting a complaint can address in writing the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security: Chief Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528. The Chief Privacy Officer will assess the situation and try to settle the dispute. One can also submit a complaint through the national data protection authority (hereinafter referred to as ”DPA”) i.e. the President of the Data Protection Office (UODO President). The Chief Privacy Officer has undertaken to handle complaints received from data protection authorities of EU member states on behalf of an EU citizen, if the citizen authorizes them to act in their case.
More information on the manner of using personal data by airlines can be obtained directly from airlines in a given country.
Regardless of the above information, the transfer of personal data to countries from outside the European Economic area takes place in accordance with the rules set out in Chapter V of the GDPR.

XII. SPECIAL RULES CONCERNING THE PROCESSING OF THE DATA OF PASSENGERS TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES
Due to the fact that the Passengers of PLL LOT travel between the European Union and the United States, below we present special rules concerning the processing of their personal data
PLL LOT, according to US law and the international agreement between the European Union and the United States, will transfer PNR data to the United States Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter referred to as ”DHS”). This data shall be transferred for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
PLL LOT will transfer the Passenger’s data collected before the travel (Advance Passenger Information – API i.e. in particular information from the Passenger’s passport that are collected during the check-in) to border control authorities. This data shall be transferred for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
In order to obtain exhaustive explanations on the manner of handling PNR data concerning flights between the European Union and the United States by DHS, one can become acquainted with the obligations of the United States Department of Homeland Security ("PNR Obligations") published in the US Federal Register vol. 64, No. 131, page 41543.
PNR data received in connection with flights between the EU and the USA may be made available to other domestic and foreign governmental authorities responsible for combatting terrorism or law enforcement for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
Some PNR data belonging to special categories of data within the meaning of 9 GDPR can be entered in the PNR if they are transferred to DHS from community booking systems or air carriers departure control. Such PNR data, which belong to special categories of data, include in particular, certain information on the Passenger’s racial or ethnic origin, their political views, religious convictions, health condition or sexual orientation. DHS has undertaken not to use any PNR data belonging to special categories of data, which they receive from booking systems or air carriers departure control in the EU. DHS has launched an automatic filtering program, preventing the use of PNR data belonging to the category of special PNR data.
PNR data from flights between the EU and the USA will be stored by DHS for 3 years and six months, unless DHS, during this time, makes manual access to this particular PNR data. In such cases, PNR data will be stored in DHS for an additional period of eight years. Moreover, information related to particular enforcement records will be kept in DHS by the time such a record is archived.
The obligation to ensure that all DHS departments handle personal information in accordance with the relevant act rests with the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security. This Officer is independent from all DHS directorates, and their findings are binding for the entire department. In order to ensure that DHS strictly follows provisions and uses proper safety measures, they will exercise general supervision over the program.
Every passenger may demand from DHS additional information on the type of PNR Data made available to DHS and ask to be issued a copy of data included in DHS database. To the extent it is permitted by the Freedom of Information Act and other statutory and implementing provisions and political objectives, regardless of the Passenger’s nationality or place of residence, DHS will consider the request concerning documents, including also PNR documents possessed by DHS. DHS can refuse to disclose or postpone the disclosure of all PNR data or part of them in certain circumstances (e.g. if there are reasons to expect that it will disrupt pending legal proceedings or cause a disclosure of techniques and procedures used during investigations conducted by law enforcement authorities). If DHS refuses access to PNR data under the departures set out in the Freedom of Information Act, there is a possibility to lodge an appeal from this decision by virtue of administrative procedure to the Chief Privacy Officer in DHS, who on behalf of DHS is responsible for both privacy protection and data disclosure rules. The final decision is actionable in court under the provisions of US law.
Passengers may demand rectification of their PNR data included in DHS databases, contacting the following offices. DHS will take into account these rectification requests which they find justified and property substantiated.
Enquiries concerning PNR data made available to DHS or requests for making data possessed by DHS and relating to the requesting party available should be sent in writing to: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229. Further information concerning the procedures of submitting such requests can be found in section 19 Code of Federal Regulations, section 103.5. If someone wants to report a problem or complaint concerning PNR data or submit a request for their correction, this can be done in writing to the address: Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229. Decisions of DHS are subject to verification of the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528. Any enquiries, complaints or requests for the rectification of PNR data can be also addressed to a data protection authority in the EU member state of a given Passenger for possible further examination.
If the complaint cannot be settled by DHS, the person submitting a complaint can address in writing the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security: Chief Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528. The Chief Privacy Officer will assess the situation and try to settle the dispute. One can also submit a complaint through the national data protection authority (hereinafter referred to as ”DPA”) i.e. the President of the Data Protection Office (UODO President). The Chief Privacy Officer has undertaken to handle complaints received from data protection authorities of EU member states on behalf of an EU citizen, if the citizen authorizes them to act in their case.
More information on the manner of using personal data by airlines can be obtained directly from airlines in a given country.
Regardless of the above information, the transfer of personal data to countries from outside the European Economic area takes place in accordance with the rules set out in Chapter V of the GDPR.

XII. SPECIAL RULES CONCERNING THE PROCESSING OF THE DATA OF PASSENGERS TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES
Due to the fact that the Passengers of PLL LOT travel between the European Union and the United States, below we present special rules concerning the processing of their personal data
PLL LOT, according to US law and the international agreement between the European Union and the United States, will transfer PNR data to the United States Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter referred to as ”DHS”). This data shall be transferred for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
PLL LOT will transfer the Passenger’s data collected before the travel (Advance Passenger Information – API i.e. in particular information from the Passenger’s passport that are collected during the check-in) to border control authorities. This data shall be transferred for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
In order to obtain exhaustive explanations on the manner of handling PNR data concerning flights between the European Union and the United States by DHS, one can become acquainted with the obligations of the United States Department of Homeland Security ("PNR Obligations") published in the US Federal Register vol. 64, No. 131, page 41543.
PNR data received in connection with flights between the EU and the USA may be made available to other domestic and foreign governmental authorities responsible for combatting terrorism or law enforcement for the purposes set out in Chapter IV of the Policy.
Some PNR data belonging to special categories of data within the meaning of 9 GDPR can be entered in the PNR if they are transferred to DHS from community booking systems or air carriers departure control. Such PNR data, which belong to special categories of data, include in particular, certain information on the Passenger’s racial or ethnic origin, their political views, religious convictions, health condition or sexual orientation. DHS has undertaken not to use any PNR data belonging to special categories of data, which they receive from booking systems or air carriers departure control in the EU. DHS has launched an automatic filtering program, preventing the use of PNR data belonging to the category of special PNR data.
PNR data from flights between the EU and the USA will be stored by DHS for 3 years and six months, unless DHS, during this time, makes manual access to this particular PNR data. In such cases, PNR data will be stored in DHS for an additional period of eight years. Moreover, information related to particular enforcement records will be kept in DHS by the time such a record is archived.
The obligation to ensure that all DHS departments handle personal information in accordance with the relevant act rests with the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security. This Officer is independent from all DHS directorates, and their findings are binding for the entire department. In order to ensure that DHS strictly follows provisions and uses proper safety measures, they will exercise general supervision over the program.
Every passenger may demand from DHS additional information on the type of PNR Data made available to DHS and ask to be issued a copy of data included in DHS database. To the extent it is permitted by the Freedom of Information Act and other statutory and implementing provisions and political objectives, regardless of the Passenger’s nationality or place of residence, DHS will consider the request concerning documents, including also PNR documents possessed by DHS. DHS can refuse to disclose or postpone the disclosure of all PNR data or part of them in certain circumstances (e.g. if there are reasons to expect that it will disrupt pending legal proceedings or cause a disclosure of techniques and procedures used during investigations conducted by law enforcement authorities). If DHS refuses access to PNR data under the departures set out in the Freedom of Information Act, there is a possibility to lodge an appeal from this decision by virtue of administrative procedure to the Chief Privacy Officer in DHS, who on behalf of DHS is responsible for both privacy protection and data disclosure rules. The final decision is actionable in court under the provisions of US law.
Passengers may demand rectification of their PNR data included in DHS databases, contacting the following offices. DHS will take into account these rectification requests which they find justified and property substantiated.
Enquiries concerning PNR data made available to DHS or requests for making data possessed by DHS and relating to the requesting party available should be sent in writing to: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229. Further information concerning the procedures of submitting such requests can be found in section 19 Code of Federal Regulations, section 103.5. If someone wants to report a problem or complaint concerning PNR data or submit a request for their correction, this can be done in writing to the address: Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229. Decisions of DHS are subject to verification of the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528. Any enquiries, complaints or requests for the rectification of PNR data can be also addressed to a data protection authority in the EU member state of a given Passenger for possible further examination.
If the complaint cannot be settled by DHS, the person submitting a complaint can address in writing the Chief Privacy Officer in the Department of Homeland Security: Chief Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528. The Chief Privacy Officer will assess the situation and try to settle the dispute. One can also submit a complaint through the national data protection authority (hereinafter referred to as ”DPA”) i.e. the President of the Data Protection Office (UODO President). The Chief Privacy Officer has undertaken to handle complaints received from data protection authorities of EU member states on behalf of an EU citizen, if the citizen authorizes them to act in their case.
More information on the manner of using personal data by airlines can be obtained directly from airlines in a given country.
Regardless of the above information, the transfer of personal data to countries from outside the European Economic area takes place in accordance with the rules set out in Chapter V of the GDPR.
