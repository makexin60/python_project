                                      information is an act of trust and we take that trust seriously.

                                      specific consent to act otherwise, the following policies will
                                      govern how Football Fan handles the personal information that
                                      you provide to us.

                                      incorporated into the APPS Terms and Conditions, which you
                                      should read together with this Privacy Policy. Capitalised words

Football Fan APPS
When you download or purchase Football Fan
                                      APPS you do so through a third party mobile application online
                                      store. You may be required to register with the mobile app store
                                      and be logged on before you can download or purchase APPS. When
                                      downloading APPS the app provider will typically collect certain
                                      device and app-related information.
Our APPS sometimes send push notifications,
                                      or notices of interest sent out to in the absence of a specific
                                      request, to your mobile device. In the event a Football Fan APPS
                                      uses push notifications, you are provided an opportunity to opt
                                      into receiving those push notifications. If you decline to
                                      accept push notifications, you will not receive push
                                      notifications, which means you may not receive the most current
                                      updates and features of the APPS.
Our APPS will collect precise information
                                      about the location of your mobile device, but you can opt-out by
                                      changing the settings on your mobile device. If you decline to
                                      share your location with the APPS, you may not receive the most
                                      accurate recommendations.
You have the right of election when it comes
                                      to how the APPS function on your mobile device. You may be able
                                      to:
manage push notifications by using your built-in mobile
                                        device settings and controls;
manage location information by using your built-in
                                        mobile device settings and controls;
block navigation to the Internet by turning off network
                                        access on the device.
Access to or availability of controls may
                                      vary depending on your device.

                                      who are under 13 years of age. It is Football Fan's policy to

                                      information you provide to us is stored on secure servers that
                                      are protected in secure facilities including firewall protection
                                      and located in those countries that form part of the European
                                      Economic Area or are considered to provide adequate protection
                                      for personal information under the European Union Data
                                      Protection Directive (95/46/EC).
Information sharing and disclosure
Football Fan is committed to protecting your
                                      personal information. We will share your personal information
                                      only as described below and that follow practices at least as
                                      protective as those described in this Privacy Policy. We will
                                      not disclose your personally identifiable information to any
                                      third parties without your consent except:
where Football Fan is required by law to disclose
                                        information to third parties;
where the disclosure is necessary for the performance
                                        of our operations (e.g. mail delivery, hosting services,
                                        service operations, protecting us from fraud); or
Football Fan buys or sells subsidiaries or business
                                        units, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a
                                        sale, merger, consolidation or asset sale, or an internal
                                        re-organisation, or in the unlikely event of insolvency. If
                                        such a transaction or event required the transfer of customer
                                        information, then that information would be one of the
                                        transferred assets, but would remain subject to the commitments
                                        made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy or equivalent.
We also may share your personal information
                                      with third parties (i.e. agents or sub-contractors) specifically
                                      engaged by Football Fan to provide services to us, in which case
                                      we will require those parties to keep that information
                                      confidential and secure and to use it solely for the purpose of
                                      providing the specified services to us.
Companies and individuals registered in the
                                      Football Fan Affiliate Program receive aggregate information
                                      about customers that they direct to Football Fan through links
                                      on their APPSs. No personally identifiable information is
                                      provided to affiliate members; the information collected from
                                      our affiliates is used strictly for the affiliates program and
                                      will not be used for general marketing purposes.
Football Fan also provides analysis of our
                                      customers in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers,
                                      content distributors, a broadcaster and other third parties. We
                                      do this so that our business partners and we can understand you
                                      better, and so we can keep bringing you first-rate services. We
                                      may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, literal statements
                                      made by our Members. At no time, however, will we disclose
                                      personal information about specific customers.
Linked APPSs are not under the control of

                                      companies linked to our APPS. Before disclosing your personal
                                      information on any other APPS we advise you to examine its Terms

                                      told what personal information we hold about you, to correct
                                      errors in that information and to prevent Football Fan from
                                      using your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
                                      Should you wish to exercise these rights, or if you have any

                                      that your information is secure on our system, no data
                                      transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
                                      secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any

                                      Football Fan APPS. We recommend that you change your password
                                      from time to time for additional security. Please advise us
                                      immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by
                                      any other Internet user or any other breach of security.
Access authorisation is granted only to staff
                                      of Football Fan and to our agents or subcontractors if necessary
                                      for the performance of our operations or for them to provide
                                      services to us. Any information accessed by those agents or
                                      subcontractors is required to be kept confidential and secure
                                      and is not permitted to be used for any purpose except to
                                      provide their services to us.
Backups are run to prevent loss of
                                      information, and our Internet servers are housed in secure
                                      facilities.
