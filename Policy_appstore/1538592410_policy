support@giraffe-games.com
to request the removal of this information from our database to the extent Giraffe stores any of this information.
Customer Service
We may collect your email address when you contact our customer service group and we may use that email address to contact you about your gaming experience with Giraffe games and notify you about company news and promotions.

Game Data Collection
Whenever you play our games, we collect anonymous data using the service of
http://www.gameanalytics.com
and sometimes use
http://www.flurry.com/solutions/analytics
(or such other service providers as we may deem appropriate).   The data thereby collected is presented to us in an anonymous form to include, for example, the percentage of users who complete a particular level.
Other Collection
We may also acquire information from you through (1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2) your participation in surveys regarding the Service or (3) your participation in a sweepstakes or contest through the Service. We may provide you the opportunity to participate in a sweepstakes or contest through our Service. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you.  Participation in these sweepstakes and contests are voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). We use this information to notify winners and award prizes, to monitor traffic or personalise the Service.  We may use a third party service provider to conduct these sweepstakes or contests; that company is prohibited from using your users’ personal information for any other purpose.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that we transfer to your computer and/or device, to identify a user’s computer/device and to “remember” things about your visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password.  Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information, such as your user ID, for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use.  You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service. We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer/device so the content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked.  Since the third party advertising companies associate your computer/device with a number, they will be able to recognise your computer/device each time they send you an advertisement.  These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service and third party sites and applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for the data collection practices of these third party advertisers, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technology. You cannot use the Sites without accepting the use of cookies.  The cookies are used to support analytics and logged in users on the Site.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We employ or our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or e-mails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may associate this information with your IP address or device identifier but do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.
Mobile Analytics
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.
Third Party Services
Our services may contain third party tracking tools from Google Analytics, our service provider. Such third party may use cookies, APIs, and SDKs in our services to enable them to collect and analyse user information on our behalf. The third party may have access to information such as your device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), geo-location information, and IP address for the purpose of providing their services under their respective privacy policies. This Policy does not cover the use of tracking tools from Google Analytics.  We do not have access or control over Google Analytics.
Ad Networks
We do not serve ads within the Sites, but we do serve ads within our games and the advertisers we use have their own terms of service which are compatible with the terms of services of the mobile platforms. The option to opt out of advertising is not available for all of our games.  When available, advertisement can be blocked by making an in app purchase.  The advertisers may collect and use information about you, such as your Service session activity, device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, geo-location information and IP address.  They may use this information to provide advertisements of interest to you. In addition, you may see our games advertised in other services.  After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of our Service.  In order to verify the installs, a device identifier may be shared with the advertiser.

Security
