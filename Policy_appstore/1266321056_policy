We retain Personal Information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and improving our products.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize the Personal Information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), we then securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
When we collect Personal Information as a processor on behalf of the controller, the controller is the party who provides instructions on deleting or anonymizing the Personal Information.
8. HOW TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
