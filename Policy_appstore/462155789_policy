VUpoint
The VUpoint Video Solution by RISCO allows the addition of video verification to its alarm system. Through an application on a smartphone, one can confirm if an alarm event is genuine. Unlike typical CCTV systems that require separate app usage to locate the correct camera or time slot, VUpoint provides a real-time push notification. This includes a series of images and a 30-second video clip from the alarm event, enabling quick understanding of the situation and subsequent action.
