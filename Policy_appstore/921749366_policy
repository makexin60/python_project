Personal Data and further information is collected via the following sources.
User-Provided Information
. We collect Personal Data voluntarily provided by users or visitors of our Services (also referred to as “Users” or “you” in this Policy), including when you visit the Sites, use the Services, register an account, fill out forms on the Sites, when you provide us with your business card, when you subscribe to our newsletters, register for trainings or seminars, attend meetings or events we organise or visit our offices.

The Personal Data that we collect on or through our Services may include:
your first and last name;
email address and mailing address;
telephone number(s);
organizational affiliation and further company details;
billing / financial information;
and any other information you choose to provide when you use the Services or otherwise interact with us.
Location Information.
For some of our services, API’s, Sites and mobile apps we also collect geo-location information. We use your location information to provide requested location-specific services, including local weather forecasts, local farm information and asset tracking. By default, permission to use your location information must be granted by you. You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by turning off the location services in your mobile phone or browser settings. Please be aware that certain features of the mobile apps will not perform as expected if location services are turned off.
We may only collect data regarding your location if you turn on such location services. The data regarding your location will be anonymised after your request. This anonymous data will be analysed to optimise our services as well as for marketing purposes. This does not identify your device or you. However, we may process your location data together with your personal information if you have given the appropriate consent.
Public sources.
Personal Data may be obtained from public registers (such as the Companies House or the Chamber of Commerce), public databases, government agencies, news articles and internet searches. Examples of data obtained from these sources are: satellite imagery, real estate and land records.
Social and professional networking
. If you register or login to our Websites or Services using social media (.e.g. LinkedIn Twitter or Google) to authenticate your identity and connect your social media login information with us, we will collect Personal Data or content needed for the registration or login that you permitted your social media provider to share with us. Such Personal Data and content may include your name and e-mail address and depending on your privacy settings, additional details about you. Please review the privacy controls on the applicable social media service to set which Personal Data you want to share with us. For further details please be referred to the
DTN Cookie statement
.
Automatically Collected Information
. As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we or our third party service providers and partners (discussed below) collect information from you over time using automated means such as cookies, beacons, or online data analytics tools. We also automatically collect Personal Data via our security systems. This “automatically collected” information may include:
CCTV camera images, photographs, voice recordings and video;
internet protocol (IP) addresses;
MAC addresses;
device IDs, device and browser type(s);
referring/exit pages;
device operating system, device version, platform version, date/time stamp, or clickstream data;
and other information about the way you use the Services.
Special categories of Personal Data
DTN collects “special category” data for use in its Services as that term is defined by the GDPR. We collect this data from our partner companies only if such data was disclosed voluntarily and with the necessary consents from the data subject. For more information on the data we collect, please see Table 2 of this Policy.
When we do need to process such Personal Data, we may request your consent to do so. Examples of special categories of Personal Data we may obtain are dietary restrictions or physical health access requirements e.g. when registering for events or trainings or consumer demographic data and personal characteristics for our US agriculture services like race or gender.

Please be aware that if you opt-out of receiving commercial email from us, it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process your request. Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive otherwise permitted administrative messages from us regarding the Services.
Financial partners
At times DTN may allow a customer to purchase or lease products or equipment and/or to make payments through the Services. In such event, DTN may use a third-party shipping company, such as UPS or FedEX, to fulfil customer orders through the Sites, and may also use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods or services that you request. The current credit card processing company that DTN uses is called CyberSource®, and more information about this company can be found at: www.cybersource.com. DTN takes all reasonable measures to select third-party agents for fulfilment and financial processing that agree to not retain, share, store, or use your personal or financial information for any other purposes than fulfilling orders or enforcing customer agreements.
Advertising
We may also partner with a third party, including our current partner AdRoll, to display advertising on our Services and/or to manage our advertising on other websites and platforms. For further details please be referred to the
DTN Cookie statement

We may share your personal information by disclosing it to a third party for a business purpose. We only make these business purpose disclosures under written contracts that describe the purposes, require the recipient to keep the personal information confidential, and prohibit using the disclosed information for any purpose except performing the contract. In the preceding twelve (12) months, DTN (or one of its entities such as Farm Market iD and/or Progressive Farmer) has disclosed personal information for a business purpose to the categories of third parties indicated in the chart below as “disclosed”.
We may also share your personal information by selling it as part of our Services, subject to your right to opt-out of those sales as set forth within Section 18.7. We collect data that includes whether a child is present within a household and the general age range of children within the household. Outside of the information described in this paragraph, we do not knowingly sell information about individuals we know are under age 18. In the preceding twelve (12)
months DTN (or one of its entities such as Telematch Inc./Farm Market iD and/or Progressive Farmer) has sold the categories of personal information to the categories of third parties indicated in the chart above as “sold”. DTN does not collect data directly from individuals for use in our Services. More information regarding your personal information sale rights is included below.

How We Share Personal Information.
As part of the Services, DTN discloses or sells the personal information identified in the chart in Section 18.2 as “sold” to the following categories of entities:
• Providers of products and services to farmers (directly or indirectly)
• Purchasers of products and services from farmers
• General sales and marketing companies
Under the CCPA, California consumers have certain rights similar to those set forth in Section 17. The following information further explains these rights, provides instructions for submitting CCPA requests, and generally describes the process DTN will use to verify and respond to CCPA requests:
You may request twice within a 12 month period that DTN disclose the categories of Personal Data collected about you in the 12 months preceding your request, the categories of sources from which the Personal Data was collected, the business or commercial purposes for which Personal Data was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom DTN shared your Personal Data. You may also make a request for the specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you. If we are able to provide this information electronically, we will do so in a portable format.
Additionally, you have the right to request that DTN delete your Personal Data from our systems. DTN will take reasonable steps to fulfil your request, however, in certain circumstances we will be unable to delete all of your Personal Data as DTN is lawfully authorized to retain certain categorizes of your Personal Data for legitimate business and regulatory purposes. In instances where DTN is not required to delete of your Personal Data, DTN will notify you of those categories of Personal Data that we did not delete and will provide an explanation as to why the information could not be deleted.
Please note that DTN must be able to verify your identity in order to comply with your requests under this section. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Data. To do so, DTN will seek to associate the information provided by you when making a request with Personal Data we have collected about you previously. If we are unable to appropriately verify your identity, we may ask you to contact us to provide additional information or explain why we are unable to complete your request. If you are requesting specific pieces of Personal Data as the authorized agent of a California consumer, we will ask you also to submit reliable proof that you have been authorized in writing by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf.
California residents may submit any of the requests described in this section by email to
privacy@dtn.com
, calling 1-800-485-4000, or by mailing a request to the address provided in Section 24 of this Policy. Please include with your request your full name, preferred contact information and the nature of your request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We endeavor to respond to verifiable consumer requests within 45 days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Children age 18 or older or their parents have the right to direct us to not sell those children’s personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page link:
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
If you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
DTN may not and will not discriminate against any California consumer for exercising any of the rights described in this section, including in terms of price or services that we offer.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as California’s “Shine the Light” law, also allows California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosures in the prior calendar year, if any, of Personal Data to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If applicable, you may be able to opt-out of our sharing of your Personal Data with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Please send your request under Section 1798.83 (along with your full name, email address, postal address, and the subject line labelled “Your California Privacy Rights”) to
privacy@dtn.com
. We will attempt to provide you with the requested information within 30 days of receipt. Please note that not all Personal Data sharing is covered by Section 1798.83’s requirements.
Nevada Residents
Nevada residents who wish to exercise their sale opt-out rights under Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A may submit a request by calling us at 1-800-485-4000 or by sending us an email at
privacy@dtn.com
, or by mailing a request to the address provided in Section 24 of this Policy.
Links and Third Party Websites
The Sites may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. We encourage our Users to read the privacy statements of each and every website they visit. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Sites and does not apply to these third-party websites. The ability to access information of third parties from the Services, or links to other websites or locations, is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their products, their services, other websites, locations, or their content.
Also, DTN may allow select third parties to offer subscription services or fee-based products through the Sites. DTN makes no guarantees in regards to the policies of these parties, so you should investigate each site’s privacy policy before providing Personal Data to third parties.
Children Should Not Provide Information to Us
None of our Services are intended for use by children, and we have no desire to collect Personal Data from those under the age of 13 (
“Children”
). DTN requests that Children DO NOT provide Personal Data to us. In an instance where such Personal Data was collected it would be purely accidental and unintentional. If we become aware that Personal Data has been submitted by a Child, the information will be deleted from the DTN databases. DTN encourages parents to discuss the Internet with their Children and monitor Personal Data that a Child may provide via the Internet.
Change in Ownership
In the event of a change in ownership of DTN as a result of a sale, merger, acquisition or bankruptcy, then DTN reserves the right to, subject to this Policy, transfer all of your Personal Data to a separate entity. DTN will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (e.g., by posting on its Sites, issuing a press release, or notification by e-mail) of any change in ownership.
Policy Changes & Updating Information
DTN reserves the right to modify this Policy whenever the need arises. Updates to this Policy will be posted to the Services in a timely manner. When such updates are made, the “last updated” date at the top of this Policy will be modified. This policy is not a contractual agreement and does not provide you with any legal right. Unless otherwise specified, the Sites, its content, and its domain name and URLs are the sole property of DTN.
