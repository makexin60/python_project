TL;DR
Sorry but we’re really not very interested in you. Or your data. Or even your taste in music.
The fact is that we don’t get any data from you at all from our app and have no way to know who you are unless you send us an email or something. We don’t even have any servers to store data, should we ever get any. Which we won’t.
We do get a bit of data from Apple though. Just the stuff that all app developers get, like how many people started our app on an iPod Touch in Canada last Tuesday.
If you are one of those good people who agree to share their app analytics data with developers:
1) Thank you, it’s hugely helpful to us in making our app better
2) It means that if our app crashes we can see roughly where it crashed. That’s all though – it doesn’t tell us anything remotely personally identifiable
If you connect Playlisty to Apple Music you’ll need to be signed-in to Apple Music, but hopefully you guessed that already. What Apple do with your data is covered by your agreement with Apple.
If you connect Playlisty to Spotify, Deezer or YouTube, you’ll need to log in to Spotify, Deezer or Google respectively. Goodness knows what they do with your data, but either way it’ll be covered by your agreements with them, not us.
The long version
Obdura Ltd (UK Company no. 13681260) built the Playlisty app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Obdura Ltd and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at www.obdura.com unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
Information Collection and Use
You may use the app to access data from third party services and these services may collect information used to identify you. Please ensure you are familiar with the privacy policies for any services that you access before using the app.
Below is a list of third party service providers which can be accessed by the app, including links to their relevant privacy policies:
Playlisty uses the Apple Music API in order to read and create playlists and add music to your library. For details of data collected by Apple please view the
Apple Music Privacy Policy
. You can de-authorize Playlisty’s access to your Apple Music account at any time by visiting your Account Settings -> Account Access and clicking the “Manage” button.
Playlisty uses the Spotify API to access the playlists, albums & songs that you’ve added to your Spotify library. For details of the data collected by Spotify please view the
Spotify Privacy Policy
. You can revoke Playlisty’s access to you Spotify account at any time by clicking
here
.
Playlisty uses Google’s YouTube API Services to access playlist and song metadata in your YouTube library. For details of the data collected by Google please view the
Google Privacy Policy
. By using Playlisty to access your Google data you are agreeing to be bound by
YouTube’s Term of Service
. Also please note that third parties may be able to serve content such as advertisements via this connection. You can revoke Playlisty’s access to your Google account at any time from the Google security settings page,
here
.
Please note: this list is not exhaustive and these are provided here for your convenience only.
App Analytics
We want to remind you that whenever you use our app or any other app from the Apple App Store, Apple collects some basic data related to your use of the app e.g. when you used it, whether you upgraded or uninstalled it etc. This data collection is governed by your agreements with Apple, but you should be aware that they share some of this data with us & all other app developers. The data we receive is completely anonymous.
Optionally you may also elect to share your device analytics with app developers (see the Privacy settings on your device). If you agree to do this, Apple will share more detailed information in the (hopefully unlikely) event of our app crashing. This information allows us to see the general area of our code where the crash happened and the nature of the crash. It enables us to improve our app, basically. It does not allow us to see any data or log files, nor anything else which might be personally identifiable to you.
If you’d like to know what data Apple have collected about you, please visit https://privacy.apple.com.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.

Apple collects information about your Apple Music and Apple Music Classical activity, such as the songs you play and how long you play them, to personalise the services when you are subscribed, send you notifications and compensate our partners.
Your Apple cloud library sends information from your music library on your device to Apple, such as song and artist names, to identify and unlock copies of any of your songs that are also available in Apple Music.
We associate your cloud library information with you for as long as you remain subscribed and for a short time after. We retain records of the songs you play for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting.
To help identify and prevent fraud, information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive, will be used to compute a device trust score when you attempt a purchase. The submissions are designed so Apple cannot learn the real values on your device. The scores are stored for a fixed time on our servers.
Protecting the privacy and security of your information is a priority for everyone at Apple. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better, and when we do collect data, we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices. Apple Music and Apple Music Classical, like every Apple product and service, are designed with these principles in mind.
We use your personal data to provide the services and features in Apple Music. This information includes your name and Apple Account photo if you’ve set one, which you can access and change in the Apple Music app settings for use with the sharing features in Apple Music, as well as account and payment information, which you can access and change in Settings or System Settings.
When you subscribe to Apple Music, your subscription includes full access to Apple Music and Apple Music Classical. Apple collects information about how you use Apple Music and Apple Music Classical in order to tailor features to your musical tastes. These features include personalised recommendations such as albums and playlists picked for you, and Radio, which plays selections from your favourite artists and genres. We also use this information so we can contact you by email and push notification about upcoming releases, new artists, and other happenings on Apple Music and Apple Music Classical that you may like.
Some Apple Music features, such as certain broadcast radio stations, may not be available in your region. Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location and determine availability.
Apple Music Classical
Apple Music subscribers have access to Apple Music Classical, a classical music application designed to allow you to discover classical tracks and albums, and save your favourite classical tracks in one centralised place. You can browse the Apple Music Classical catalogue without a subscription, but you must have an Apple Music subscription to access all the features of Apple Music Classical. If you do not have an active Apple Music subscription, you will be given the option to subscribe to Apple Music to get full access to Apple Music Classical.
Cloud Library
Your Apple cloud library, which is a benefit of your Apple Music subscription, allows you to have access to the songs and playlists in your library from any of your devices. This feature sends information from your library on your device to Apple, such as song and artist names, in order to identify and unlock copies of any of your songs that are also available in Apple Music and Apple Music Classical. Any songs that can’t be found in Apple Music are uploaded to your personal cloud library, so you can have access to your complete collection from any of your devices through Apple Music. To stop syncing your cloud library on your iOS, iPadOS or visionOS device, go to Settings > Apps > Music and tap to turn off Sync Library. On Mac, open Apple Music and go to Settings > General, then deselect Sync Library.
Apple Music Profile
If you want to connect or share with other people using Apple Music, you can create a personal profile by providing a user handle (for example, @johnappleseed), display name and, if desired, a profile photo and other information. Apple stores this information with your account so you can access it from any of your devices. Your user handle, display name and profile photo can appear alongside any content you post and activity you share on Apple Music. Sharing and posting content are not currently intended for or available to Apple Accounts for children.
Other people may also be able to find your Apple Music profile using the information you’ve provided.
You can make the contents of your profile, like listening activity and playlists, available only to those you choose. However, your profile information, such as handle, display name, photo, your followers and who you are following, is visible to everyone by default. To block a user from seeing your profile, go to the user’s profile, tap More, then tap Block. People you block won’t see your music or find your profile in Apple Music.
When you create a profile on Apple Music, we will recommend other Apple Music subscribers with whom you may want to connect as friends. Apple does not learn or store information from your contacts when checking for friends to recommend. Only shortened and encrypted hashes of the phone numbers and email addresses in your contacts are sent to Apple, and then matching Apple Music subscribers to be recommended are determined locally on your device. Apple Music can periodically check your contacts to recommend new friends in the future; you can control this in Account Settings by disabling Contacts on Apple Music. If you do not want to be found by others based on the Apple Account contact information they may have about you in their contacts, you can change this in Account Settings by disabling Allow Finding by Apple Account.
Information you provide in your profile may be updated or removed by you at any time. Whenever you share online, you should think carefully about what you are making public. When you share from Apple Music to other websites or social networks, anything you share is governed by the privacy policies of those other services.
SharePlay
When you subscribe to Apple Music, you can host SharePlay sessions when connected to an Apple TV, HomePod or CarPlay, or when using Bluetooth. With SharePlay, other Apple Music subscribers can join your SharePlay session and control the music playing through Apple Music. SharePlay also allows users without an Apple Music subscription to join your SharePlay session. Apple uses Bluetooth, if enabled on your device, to allow your nearby contacts to discover your Apple Music session and request to join it. If you do not want contacts to be able to discover your device and request to join your Apple Music session, you can turn off discoverability by nearby contacts in the Apple Music app Settings. Contacts, as well as other participants, can also join the session by scanning the QR code displayed in Apple Music app settings, or the vehicle interface if participating in a SharePlay session in the car.
The name and profile photo of the participants in the session will be visible to everyone in the session. Contributions to a SharePlay session are attributed to the individual who made them and are associated with that user’s name and profile photo, if provided, which are editable at any time in the Apple Music app settings. You can remove participants from a SharePlay session you are hosting by tapping the SharePlay icon in the Apple Music app, then selecting the participant to remove. To leave a SharePlay session, tap the SharePlay icon in the Apple Music app, then tap Leave. To end a SharePlay session that you are hosting, tap End in the Apple Music app. Apple does not retain information about your contacts or other participants who have joined a SharePlay session after the session ends.
You can also enable SharePlay sessions in Messages or during a FaceTime call to share music in sync with others. To start a session, select the music you want to listen to, then tap SharePlay in the music options, enter the contacts to share with, then tap Messages or FaceTime and Start.
Collaborate on Playlists
Apple Music subscribers can create and collaborate on playlists with other Apple Music subscribers. If you are the creator of the playlist, you can choose to approve each person who joins the playlist, or you can allow anyone with the link to the playlist to join automatically. All participants can add and remove songs from the playlist and add emoji reactions. Contributions are attributed to the individual who made them and are associated with that user’s name and profile photo, if provided, which are editable at any time in the Apple Music app settings. All participants in the playlist, and anyone with access to the playlist, can see and view the name and photo of other participants. Playlist participants can view all songs and reactions added by other participants. To stop collaborating, remove yourself from the playlist in the playlist settings, or if you are the creator, stop the collaboration in the playlist manage collaboration settings. If the creator of the playlist ends the collaboration, the playlist becomes a shared playlist that collaborators will have access to in their Apple Music library.
Personalising and Improving Apple Music and Apple Music Classical
When you use your Apple Music subscription or play free content outside of your library, we may collect information about the songs and videos (where applicable) you play or add to your music library or playlists, and the artists and content you favourite or share. Information such as the account, IP address, and device, app or car interface you used to play, where in Apple Music or Apple Music Classical you were when you played it, the time you played it and for how long is noted and sent to Apple. We use this information to customise your experience, to send you emails and notifications, and to help us understand how Apple Music and Apple Music Classical are being used so we may improve our services. For example, this information can help us pick the music, videos and artist content we show you in Apple Music and Apple Music Classical. It also allows us to make other recommendations to you that reflect your tastes, create city charts to show you trending music by city, and to provide personalised Apple Music search results using a mix of information such as your listening history and favourite genres. We also use this information to pay royalties and prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions or applicable law.
We retain this information for the duration of your Apple Music subscription and thereafter for a period of up to two years to communicate with you about music that may be of interest to you and offers for which you may be eligible. We also retain this information where it is necessary for financial reporting for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to such reporting, which vary by region. For most customers, that requires at least a 10-year retention period, but in regions such as China, that period can be 30 years.
If you use SharePlay to listen to content with other users on Apple Music, the Apple Music app will collect information about the content you listened to during the SharePlay session and the approximate number of participants in the session, but does not retain any information to identify the participants of a SharePlay session.
We also use Apple Music search data to improve models that power Apple Music. For example, aggregate Apple Music search queries are used to fine-tune the Apple Music search model.
Communicating with You
Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own, the Apple apps you download and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about Apple Music and other Apple products, services and offers that may be of interest to you, including Apple Music Classical and Apple One. Your device serial number and other hardware identifiers, or details about your relevant App Store subscriptions, may be used to check eligibility for Apple service offers. If you are in a Family Sharing group, Apple may send you communications about products, services and offers available to you through Family Sharing. If you purchase an Apple One subscription, we may send you emails and push notifications about the features of each of the services for which you have subscribed. Apple may also use information about your activity within Apple Music and Apple Music Classical, and your interaction with services used, to verify eligibility for available discounted Apple Music subscriptions (such as Apple Music Student) to send you emails and push notifications about new features, content and offers available in Apple Music and Apple Music Classical. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to
account.apple.com
. To update your notification preferences on your iOS, iPadOS or visionOS device, go to Settings > Notifications > Music. On Mac, open Apple Music and go to Settings > General > Notifications. Apple uses information about your interactions with our communications, including notifications, to improve our services.
Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity
We compute a device trust score on your device when you attempt a purchase using information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive. The submission is designed so Apple cannot learn the underlying values on your device. The score is stored for a fixed time on our servers. Apple may also use information about your historical business relationship with Apple to process Apple Music subscription renewals and determine whether to provide ongoing access to your subscription in advance of authorisation by the payment partner.
Disclosure to Third Parties
Radio Stations
When you use Apple Music to listen to broadcast radio, your device connects directly to the broadcast radio station to provide you with the requested content. When it connects, your device’s IP address will be visible to the broadcast radio station. The handling of your IP address by the broadcast radio station is governed by the privacy policies of the broadcast radio station or its provider.
Record Labels, Artists and Chart Compilers
We are obligated to provide some aggregated non-personal data about the use of Apple Music and Apple Music Classical, as well as aggregated user demographics such as age group and gender (which may be inferred from information such as your name and salutation in your Apple Account), to record labels, publishers and artists so they can measure the performance of their creative work and meet royalty and accounting requirements. In addition, we share aggregated listening activity with chart compilers for music charts around the world, with labels and artists to measure engagement, including in real time, and with music marketing platforms that help labels and artists reach listeners. In order to determine your subscription eligibility if you subscribe to Apple Music through a third-party partner like a network provider, or to complete your purchase, we share limited personally identifiable information with that partner.
Connecting Apple Music with Other Apps
iOS, iPadOS and visionOS apps, and apps on non-Apple platforms, may request access to Apple Music and your cloud library. If you give such permission to an app, it can access information like your cloud library on device, whether you are an Apple Music subscriber, your music and video play activity, and your recommendations in Apple Music. A permitted app can also modify data associated with your account, such as which songs are in your library and playlists. If you grant permission to the Photos app to access Apple Music, Photos will use songs from Apple Music to play with memory movies. When you create a custom memory movie in Photos, information about the prompt you enter to create the memory may be sent to Apple Music to select music to play with the movie. Apple apps with supported content, such as Remote, will also be automatically connected when you start using the Apple Music app and supported content. You can disable an app’s access on your iOS, iPadOS or visionOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Media & Apple Music. On Mac, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Media & Apple Music. If you have removed the app or granted an app access using a version of iOS earlier than iOS 11 or iPadOS, you can disable its access in your Apple Music account settings.
Apple Music Subscriptions Through Your Network Provider
If your mobile network provider offers Apple Music subscriptions and free trials, Apple may check your phone number to determine whether you are eligible through a network provider. If you sign up for an Apple Music subscription or free trial through your mobile network provider or another Apple partner, Apple will use your phone number or unique account identifier shared by the partner to identify your account and to let the mobile network provider or other partner know that you have activated your subscription. We will use the phone number or unique identifier associated with your subscription to verify your account during sign-in and to connect your Apple Music activity with your account. We also use your phone number to request cancellation of your subscription with your network provider at your request.
Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
We process your personal data in Apple Music generally for performance of your contract with Apple, as necessary for providing the service and to comply with our legal obligations. Where consent is the appropriate legal basis, we seek it in accordance with applicable local law.
Where applicable local law provides, we process personal data as necessary for purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party in order to:
Provide you with access to the content in Apple Music and Apple Music Classical that you listen to, add to your library or download
Personalise your experience in Apple Music and Apple Music Classical
Identify and unlock copies of your songs that are also available through Apple Music
Determine the availability of content in your region and your eligibility for offers and subscriptions
Help to improve and optimise Apple Music and Apple Music Classical for you and others, and send you communications about the Apple Music and Apple Music Classical apps, and other Apple products, services and offers that may be of interest to you
Create and maintain your Apple Music Profile and playlists
Pay royalties to, and provide reporting for, publishers, labels, artists and chart compilers
Prevent fraud and other malicious activity
The data used includes:

Details about your device and account
Your IP address
Your Apple Music Profile and playlists
The device trust score
Non-Personal Data
We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal data for any purpose. For example, we may aggregate your non-personal data with that of other Apple Music users in order to improve the service. We may also collect certain performance metrics from your device when you use Apple Music, including radio frequency strength, country code, network code and mobile data radio access technology.

To verify a request to know, request to delete, and request to correct, we ask you to provide certain details related to your Spotify account. Please note, if you do not have a Spotify account we will not have enough information about you to verify your identity and respond to your requests, as we do not keep sufficient information necessary to re-identify and link you to a prior visit to the Spotify Service where data may have been collected. As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests.
Household requests
If all the members of a household make an access, correction or deletion request, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.
Requests made through agents
You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney (in accordance with local law), an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
Appeals process
If your request is denied you may have the right to appeal the denial in accordance with the instructions provided to you when the denial was made.
Tailored advertising controls
What is tailored advertising?
This is when we use information about your use of our services and other websites and mobile apps to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising, targeted advertising, or ‘sharing’ for purposes of cross-context behavioural advertising.
An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner provides us with information indicating that you may be interested in cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.
How to control tailored advertising:
You can control tailored advertising on your
Account Privacy
page under ‘Tailored Ads’.
If you do not have an account or are not logged in, you can also opt-out by clicking the
'Your Privacy Choices'
link at the footer of our website.
You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode’s show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.
You can also visit our services via a browser with a recognized opt-out preference signal enabled, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC). If you use a preference signal you may need to renew your preferences if you visit the Spotify Service with another device or browser, or if you clear your cookies.
If you are ‘opted out’ of tailored advertising on your
Account Privacy
page, you will receive less relevant advertising, including on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.
Appropriate age for tailored advertising:
Younger users may have tailored advertising turned off by default. When you reach the appropriate age, you will start to receive tailored advertising . When this happens, you will receive a message within the Spotify Service to let you know. This message will contain a link to the
Account Privacy
page where you can change your preferences or ‘opt-out’ of tailored advertising at any time under Tailored Ads.

6. Data retention
We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify’s legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:
maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
complying with our legal obligations
resolving disputes
Here are some of the categories of our retention periods, and the criteria we use to determine them:
Data retained until you remove it
It’s your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See the section on ‘Deletion’ in
Section 2 ‘Your personal data rights and controls’
for more information, and the circumstances in which we can act on your request.
You can also delete certain personal data directly from the Spotify Service: for example, you can edit or delete your profile picture. Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses unless one of the limited purposes described below applies.
Data that expires after a specific period of time
We have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time. For example, personal data you may input as part of search queries is generally deleted after 90 days.
Data retained until your Spotify account is deleted
We keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. Examples of this include your Spotify username and profile information. We also typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalized recommendations that take listening habits into account (for example, Your Time Capsule or Your Summer Rewind). When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of data is deleted or de-identified.
Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes
After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be:
to help ensure user safety, or
to protect against harmful content on our platform.
This helps us investigate potential breaches of our
User Guidelines
and
Platform Rules
. On the other hand, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.
7. Transfer to other countries
Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify transfers personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law.
We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:
technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymization
policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests
8. Keeping your personal data safe
We’re committed to protecting our users’ personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.
We have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies.
To protect your user account, we encourage you to:
use a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account
never share your password with anyone
limit access to your computer and browser
log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
read more detail on
protecting your account
You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the ‘Sign out everywhere’ function on
your account page
.
If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.
It’s your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you’re comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else’s use of your Spotify account may impact your personalized recommendations.
9. Children
Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids except where the
Spotify Kids Privacy Policy
says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.
The Spotify Service has a minimum ‘Age Limit’ in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:
is under the age of 13 years
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
requires parental consent to process their personal data
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you’re under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a
Spotify Kids
account.
If you’re a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify,
contact us
.
If we learn that we’ve collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we’ll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.
When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services

, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account

Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
