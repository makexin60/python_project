DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS
Disputes.
The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and The Run Experience. For the purposes of this Section, “Dispute” shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and The Run Experience arising under or relating to the Products, the Sites, this Agreement, or any other transaction involving you and The Run Experience, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law.
YOU AND
THE RUN EXPERIENCE
AGREE THAT “DISPUTE” AS DEFINED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR
THE RUN EXPERIENCE
FOR (A) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (B) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (C) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (D) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION. Moreover, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.
Binding Arbitration.
You and The Run Experience further agree: (a) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in this Agreement; (b) this Agreement memorializes a transaction in interstate commerce; (c) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section; and (d) this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.
The arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction could, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.
Dispute Notice.
In the event of a Dispute, you or The Run Experience must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the “Dispute Notice”). The Dispute Notice to The Run Experience must be addressed to: The Run Experience, LLC, ADD MAILING ADDRESS. The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. If The Run Experience and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or The Run Experience may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.
WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.
YOU AND
THE RUN EXPERIENCE
AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.  ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS SECTION, AN ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT COMBINE OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY’S CLAIMS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES TO AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.
Arbitration Procedure.
If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”), available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this Agreement, except that JAMS may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement, the rules set forth in this Agreement shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (a) trade secret misappropriation, (b) patent infringement, (c) copyright infringement or misuse, or (d) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of “Disputes” as stated above. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in the City and County of San Francisco, California, at your option.
Amendments to this Section.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and The Run Experience agree that if The Run Experience makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to The Run Experience’s address) in this Agreement, The Run Experience will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments. If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in this current Agreement, without any of the proposed amendments governing. If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.
Severability.
If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of the Terms and Conditions.
Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies
The Run Experience and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Agreement (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Superior Court of San Francisco, California, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.
General
The Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between The Run Experience and you with respect to your use of the Sites, your purchase of products and services through the Sites, and as applicable any products or services of The Run Experience. Any cause of action you may have with respect to the Sites or The Run Experience’s products or services must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises, notwithstanding any statutes of limitation to the contrary. The section titles used in the Terms and Conditions are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and The Run Experience, and you do not have any authority to create any obligation or make any representation on The Run Experience’s behalf. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations of these Terms and Conditions, by operation of law or otherwise, without The Run Experience’s written consent. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms and Conditions will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against you and The Run Experience and their respective successors and assigns.
The terms of this section survive any termination of the Terms and Conditions.
Other important terms
These Terms and Conditions supersede any other terms and conditions previously published by us and any other representations or statements made by us to you, whether oral, written, or otherwise. We may assign, transfer, or sub-contract any of our rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions to any third party at our discretion. No delay by us in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms and Conditions shall operate as waiver of that right or remedy or shall affect our ability to subsequently exercise that right or remedy. Any waiver must be agreed by us in writing.
