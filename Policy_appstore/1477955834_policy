” or “We” or “Us”), with registered office at Belgicastraat 3, box 6, 1930 Zaventem, Belgium, is a Belgian Company providing high-quality services in purpose-built parking facilities and off-street parking at strategic locations in Belgium.
Q-Park
aims to be the most preferred and recommended parking partner at strategic locations, offering you the best possible service, based on functional quality, operational excellence, customer satisfaction and sustainable financial performance.
In the execution of its business activities,
Q-Park
is required to process personal data. Data protection and respect for privacy are essential values that we share. Therefore, we only collect the data that is necessary to provide our services and we are strongly committed to protecting personal data and compliance to the general data protection regulation (‘gdpr’) and applicable privacy legislation in order to protect your personal data, which is made known to us in the course of our business and to process it only for the specific purposes for which it is collected, used and retained.
Q-Park
acts as the controller for the processing of your personal data as described in this Privacy Statement. In addition,
Q-Park
B.V., responsible for the general management of the
Q-Park
Group, is the data controller together with
Q-Park
for the processing of personal data for the purpose of analysing company information.
The purpose of this document is to be transparent about, and explain how and why we collect, use, store and otherwise process your personal data. For more information on this, please contact our data protection officer, whose contact details you can find below.

Our processing operations
The categories of personal data that
Q-Park
processes
Personal information that we process depends on the context of your interactions with
Q-Park
. You may provide certain personal information to us when you sign up for an account and use our service, consult with our customer service team, send us an email, or communicate with us in any other way.
Q-Park
can collect and otherwise process the following categories of personal data:
Contact details
Before you start using our services, you may register an account with us and we then collect your name, address, residence, telephone number and email address. When you register a corporate account with us, we collect information about your organisation like name and address as well.
Financial details (e.G. Bank account or credit card number)
When you register an account with us, we collect and use your payment information. This can include your name, address, residence, telephone number, email address, credit or debit card information and any other relevant information. We keep records of your
Q-Park
subscriptions and parking fees and of disagreements over your parking fees as well.
Parking ticket (e.g. number plate or QR code)
Q-Park
constantly innovates to make parking easier for you.
Q-Park
has introduced Parking as a Smart Service ("PaSS") in parking facilities to let you enjoy a carefree, fair and transparent parking experience.
Q-Park
has its own smartphone app. One of its functions is to download and display a parking ticket. When you use the
Q-Park
app for these "smart parking facilities", we collect and use your QR code or number plate to make parking possible. For example to automatically open the exit barrier when you leave. When you use our services with your QR code, you have your QR code scanned when you drive in and out. If you use our services with your number plate, we use automated number plate recognition. We take a photo of your number plate. We do not take a photo of your vehicle or its occupants.
In both cases we register the date, time and parking facility you park with us. We then use digital payment solutions to enable billing. This means we charge you automatically, without you having to manually pay for a parking ticket.
Location details (
Q-Park
app)
When you have given your consent, we register your current location via the
Q-Park
app. This allows us to help you search for the best parking facility nearby and to provide you a better user experience by centring the virtual map around your current location.
When you do not accept sending your location information by the app or your mobile device settings, location information will not be sent to us.
Video recordings
We use video surveillance in our parking facilities to protect our property and parking facilities against vandalism, optimise our services, support our operational processes and prevent fraud. Video surveillance can involve the collection and otherwise processing of your personal data like your image.
Information about our communication with you
When you contact our customer services via telephone or intercom, we may record, store and use your conversation with us. We use these call recordings to detect and resolve reoccurring issues in a parking facility. We also use call recordings to educate and train our employees on how to assist customers properly and to evaluate and monitor how our employees perform. We do this to provide you the best possible parking experience.
Marketing purposes
When you register an account with us, we may use your personal data like your name and email address to advertise our services to you, including to provide you with promotional materials or offers for products and services from
Q-Park
, or send you other communications relating to our services.
Information we collect when you use our websites and app
We use cookies, web beacons (small graphic data, that recognize user activity, such as if and how often a user has visited a website) and other technologies to collect information that helps us enhance your experience. Cookies and other similar technologies that we use allow our website and app to function, and help us to understand how to better tailor these to your interests.
We collect information related to the device, browser and the app that you are using (such as your device identifiers and your operating system), and network information (telecommunications carrier’s name, ip address, etc.) to better understand how our website visitors use our website and app, and to monitor and protect the security.
This allows us to customise and improve your experience and to analyse trends, administer the website, track your movements around our website and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
Q-Park
uses a combination of essential, statistic, analytical and marketing cookies. You can control or reset your cookies and similar technologies through your web browser, which will allow you to customise your cookie preferences and to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Analysis of business information
Q-Park
and
Q-Park
B.V. may use data collected when providing the parking services, such as QR code, date, parking location or place of residence, in aggregated form to gain insight and make decisions based on this. This allows us to improve and optimise our parking services. For example, by monitoring how many vehicles are in which parking locations at which times, we can manage any congestion.
How we collect your personal data
Q-Park
generally collects your personal data directly from you. You provide us personal data when you create an account, purchase subscriptions, enter into contracts, ask us for assistance and use our websites, app and services. We may also process your personal data by using video surveillance in our parking facilities.
We also collect your personal data from our business partners. These partnerships may involve our partners sharing some of your personal data so that we can provide our services to you. There are cases where we collect personal data from a partner operating its own service, or from a business partner operating a service that is linked to our services to unburden you as much as possible.
Our purposes and legal bases
Performance of contract
This is the reason why
Q-Park
processes data in the most cases. This includes processing of  personal data for:
•
parking in one of the
Q-Park
parking facilities;
•
managing and administer registration and subscriptions;
•
using the
Q-Park
app (all necessary data for the execution of the agreement);
•
effecting a subscription;
O
invoicing and accounting purposes
•
in general; providing you our services (such as customer services, claims handling,….)
Without your personal data (such as your contact or financial details,…), we’ll not be able to provide you our services. (for example, you may be required to provide information to allow payment)
Your consent
Personal data may be processed if you provide us with your consent. When we do not have a contractual relationship between us or when the processing is not necessary for the performance of a contract, you can give us your consent so that we can process your personal data.
Q-Park
will use this legal ground related to matters such as:
•
Q-Park
app (we use your location it to help you to find a parking facility that you are nearby);
•
the use of certain analytical and marketing cookies on the
Q-Park
websites.
Compliance with legal obligations
In exceptional cases, we may need to process your personal data to comply with legal obligations like warrants issued by judicial and administrative authorities.
Your vital interests
This could relate to your vital medical interest (essential for your life) being at stake in our premises.
Our legitimate interest
We use personal data for the development and improvement of our services for providing better services, products and contents toward the future.
The purposes for which we process personal data based on this legal ground are mainly the following:
•
communication with you (answering your inquiries, sending newsletters and hosting promotional events);
•
customer surveys;
•
preventing and investigating actual or suspected legal violations;
O
prevention of nuisance, denying access to parking facilities, improving safety/security in and around parking facilities, combating/preventing car break-ins and discouraging people from causing nuisance at parking facilities;
•
safeguard our rights and to protect our assets and business.
When the processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by
Q-Park
or by a third party we have assessed that the legitimate interest doesn’t outweigh your personal interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
How do we manage your personal data?
Securing your personal data
Q-Park
has put appropriate technical and organizational measures in place to protect your personal data against loss or any form of unlawful processing. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal data and other information transmitted to us. For example, only authorized employees have access to your personal, which they need for the performance of their duties. These employees are bound to confidentiality and subject to a non-disclosure agreement.
Sharing your personal data
Q-Park
may share your personal data with third parties or grant them access to your personal data, required for providing our services (e.G.: building and operation of infrastructure, customer support) provided we meet the following requirements:
•
the third party processes your personal data on our behalf, and we have obtained and processed your personal data in accordance with this privacy statement;
•
Q-Park
has made appropriate agreements with the third party to protect your personal data.
Q-Park
remains responsible vis-à-vis you for the processing of your personal data by the third party.
Transferring your personal data
In principle,
Q-Park
undertakes to process your personal data within the european economic area (“eea”) as much as possible. When we process your personal data outside the eea, we undertake to process your personal data only in countries for which the european commission has issued an adequacy decision. When the european commission has not issued an adequacy decision, we undertake to implement appropriate and suitable safeguards to provide an appropriate level of protection of your personal data.
Storing your personal data
Unless otherwise required by applicable law or regulation, we retain your personal data no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which we collected them, originating from the lawful purposes set out in this privacy statement.
Once we have realised the purposes for which we process your personal data, we will permanently delete, destroy or de-identify the relevant personal data so that we can no longer tie the relevant personal data to you.  We have put into place procedures ensuring that documents and files are purged.
