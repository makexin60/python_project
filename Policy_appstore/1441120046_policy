ABOUT
Since 1994, Barracuda has changed significantly in order to make sure we are always providing the best quality service to our customers.
THE BARRACUDA STORY
Less than an hour from Dubai you’ll find the largest bottle shop in the UAE. The Original Barracuda first opened its doors in 1994 and has been servicing UAE customers ever since. With over 6000 different products we have the most competitive pricing in the UAE.

Humble Beginnings
Barracuda was established in 1994 and used to run out of a makeshift portacabin, the kind you would likely find on construction sites. It wasn’t the most glamorous of beginnings, but it was a start.
Growing Up
In 1997, Barracuda outgrew the Portacabin and needed to expand. The cabin that had served us so well was removed and a small single storey shop was built in its place.
Double the fun
In 2009 Barracuda built an entirely new shop, large enough to cater to the ever growing demands and offering a much larger selection of wine, beer and spirits. An additional floor to house the offices and management required was added and the old single storey building was used for storage.
To the future
In 2016, Barracuda knocked down the old single storey shop that was being used as a store room to build a larger parking area.
Expanding
In 2017 Barracuda extended the beer and wine sections inside the store to make space for products that are exclusive to us or difficult to find anywhere else in the region thus offering our customers the largest selection of beer, wine and spirits in the UAE.
The Original
In 2018 Barracuda launched a new look and feel to the shop that is not only modern and fresh but also recognizes our long standing history in the UAE. We are constantly improving our shop to ensure we provide the best quality and services to our loyal and loving customers.
