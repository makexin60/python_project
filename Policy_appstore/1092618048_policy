Who has access to your personal data
Internal access:
Only employees who need access to personal data to perform their tasks are granted access. This mainly means our customer service representatives, as well as employees who follow up on any errors or disputes related to the services. A very limited number of our employees have access to our entire customer register, with the aim of ensuring the continuous operation of this customer register.
External access:
UIP will only disclose your personal data to third parties if UIP has a legal basis for disclosure. UIP may, for example, disclose personal data to public authorities to comply with statutory requirements or orders (e.g. the tax authorities or the police), or to safeguard our rights in connection with a dispute with a customer (e.g. to the Consumer Council or the Consumer Complaints Board). We can also share your personal data with partners who offer our users member benefits, such as OBOS. Disclosure to such partners is conditional on your consent. We share aggregated and anonymized data about our users and their use of the service - which cannot identify you as an individual - with research projects and institutions for statistical and research purposes, to the client (the municipality), and openly to the public.
Data processors:
UIP uses data processors to collect, store or otherwise process personal data on our behalf, e.g. in connection with the use of IT systems, payment services, email newsletters, chat services, etc. The relationship with such suppliers is governed by a data processor agreement, which inter alia ensures information security for your personal data.
Your rights
You have the right to request access to, rectification or erasure of the personal data we process about you if the conditions for this are met. You may also have the right to request restricted processing, object to the processing (protest) and, in some cases, request data portability, which means you can request that your personal data be transferred to you or to another company in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. If the processing is based on your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
You also have the right to complain about our processing of your personal data to the Data Protection Authority, but we encourage you to contact us first so that we can address your objections and clarify any misunderstandings.
You have access at all times to given consents and information we have stored about you in your user profile, and you can correct or delete information yourself and withdraw your consents here.
