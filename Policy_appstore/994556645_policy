About Curious World / Kidsy & the Plato Media Group of Companies
The Curious World website and application are operated by Kidsy Limited, trading as Curious World. We are a company dedicated to the operation and development of apps and other digital products for children, aiming to engage, educate, and entertain.Â  For more information, please see the
About Us
section of the Curious World website.
Please note that due to the change in ownership in September 2020, Kidsy Limited is now wholly owned by Plato Media Limited, which is part of the Sandbox Group. The Sandbox Group is Sandbox International Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries and or affiliates.
This privacy policy is issued on behalf of Kidsy Limited. Reference to "Curious World", "we", "us" or "our" relates to the relevant Company in the Sandbox Group responsible for processing your personal information.
We collect, use and are responsible for certain personal information about you. We are regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom) and we are responsible as 'controller' of that personal information.
Our service
The Curious World App can be downloaded without requiring a user to subscribe or provide any personal information. The app is available to download on selected mobile devices and as a web app hosted at
kidsy.curiousworld.com
.
Please note that your and your children's interactions with a mobile or tablet device where Curious World is installed may involve Apple (or other device manufacturer or provider) and those interactions are governed separately by Apple's (or such other party's) privacy policies and terms.
We may also send alerts or notifications to your device as part of the usage and features of the Curious World App. These may include prompts or reminders to pay for a subscription that has lapsed or expired, or to notify you of important information about the usage of the app.
Interactions with third-party sites
On the
www.curiousworld.com
website, which is intended solely for use by parents, guardians, or other adults, there is certain functionality that allows users to interact with and post or send user-generated content in a pre-templated fashion to Facebook or other third party platforms, social media sites and/or other applications or offerings.
The
www.curiousworld.com
website is separate from our web app hosted at
kidsy.curiousworld.com
. The web app has been created to be used by children in the same way as the Curious World mobile apps.
Personal information
The personal information we collect about you depends on the particular activities carried out through our website or app. Such information includes:
your name and email address
details of any feedback you give us by phone, email, post or via social media
information about the services we provide to you
your account details, such as username, login details
information you chose to give us in relation to a Child Profile within your account, such as your child's first name and date of birth

What information do we collect on parts of our app directed to children?
We have taken steps to have the Curious World App comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and with all the protections required for the protection of children under the General Data Protection Regulation and associated legislation and guidelines (GDPR). For example, we do not use the Curious World App to collect personal information (as broadly defined by COPPA and GDPR) for purposes of online behavioural advertising. We may, however, in compliance with COPPA and GDPR, collect or share certain information to support our internal operations, such as for performing analytics, enabling or delivering certain types of content or features, and for improving or maintaining the Curious World App.
