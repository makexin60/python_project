Information We Process on Behalf of Our Enterprise Customers
We provide the Globalstar services to consumers and to enterprise customers. Our enterprise customers may choose to use the Globalstar services to process some of their information. The information that we process through the Globalstar services for our enterprise customers is controlled by those customers. We process that information at the direction of those customers and our privacy practices governing the processing of that information will be in accordance with contracts that we may have in place with those customers.
If you have any questions or concerns about how such information is handled or would like to exercise your rights, you should contact the enterprise customer who has contracted with us to use the Globalstar services to process your information. Our enterprise customers determine how and for what purpose the information collected on their behalf should be processed. We will, however, assist our enterprise customers in addressing any concerns you may have, in accordance with the terms of our contract with them.

2. Use of Your Personal Information
We use the personal information we collect (including by combining information collected in different ways) for a variety of purposes depending on the Globalstar products and services you use and how you use them. We use your personal information for:

We do this based upon those legal requirements or our legitimate interest in that regard.
Consent
. Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use your personal data for purposes for which you have provided consent.
3. Disclosure of Your Personal Information
We may disclosure your personal information to:
Affiliates
. Your personal information may be disclosed to our parent corporation or certain other affiliates for internal audit, management, billing or administrative purposes. Globalstar, Inc. and some of its affiliates are located outside of the European Economic Area, so Globalstar may transfer and process your personal information to countries other than your country of residence. For more information, please see the "International Transfer" section below.
Your Dealer
. Your dealer may have access to the information you provide in your service application form which it collects from you as a part of the sign-up process. In addition, certain account and usage information, such as service phone number, traffic details and/or activation status may be disclosed by Globalstar to your dealer for the purpose of determining and verifying commissions and maintaining business records. Our dealers are independent businesses and responsible for how they use your information – you should check their privacy notice for more information on how they use your information.
Globalstar does not control and is not responsible for what they do with your personal information. If you have questions or concerns about how those independent businesses use or disclose your personal information, you need to contact them directly.
Service Providers and Professional Advisers
. Globalstar may transfer personal information to outside agents or service providers (including affiliates of Globalstar acting in this capacity) that perform services on our behalf, for example billing, mailing, collection or information technology hosting or processing services, as well as our professional advisers (who are often independent ‘data controllers’) such as lawyers and accountants. Some of these may be located outside of the European Economic Area and your personal information may be collected, used, disclosed, stored and processed in the U.S. or other jurisdictions outside of the European Economic Area for the purposes described in this notice.
Process payments
. We transmit your personal information via an encrypted connection to our payment processors.
Mergers and Business Transactions
. Your personal information may be used by Globalstar and disclosed to parties connected with the contemplated or actual ﬁnancing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets (including, for example, your service account with us), for purposes related to the evaluation and performance of these transactions or to give effect to them, including:
permitting such parties to determine whether to proceed or continue with the transaction;
fulﬁlling reporting, inspection or audit requirements or obligations to such parties; and
the use and disclosure of your personal information by such parties for substantially the same purposes as described in this statement.
Other Recipients
. Globalstar may otherwise disclose personal information as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, insurance, audit, processing and security requirements as permitted or required by law. This may include disclosing personal information to law enforcement authorities where Globalstar has a legal obligation to do so, or it is otherwise permitted by applicable law, or we considered it appropriate to do so. We do this to comply with our legal obligations and in our and others’ legitimate interests in protecting the property, rights, name and safety of us and others.
4. Cookies and tracking technologies
Our site makes use of cookies and similar technologies in accordance with our
Cookie Notice
.
5. Data Retention
We retain your information for the period necessary to fulﬁl the purposes outlined in this notice or such longer retention period as may be required or permitted by applicable law. For instance, we may keep your information to comply with our legal obligations (e.g. tax laws), to resolve disputes, to enforce our contracts or as otherwise permitted by law.
The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it, and applicable law. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to a contract or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, where we are using your personal information in order to provide you with services / products and perform our contract with you, we normally retain the relevant information for the duration of the contract and a period of 7 years after that. After that period, we normally anonymize or de-identify and aggregate the data and then use it in its anonymized or aggregated form for internal research and analysis. Where personal information is provided to request direct marketing and similar materials from Globalstar, we keep that personal information until you ask us not to send any further such materials. We will keep a record of any request not to receive these materials to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in the future. When you apply for a job, we keep your CV and other information for 10 years after the date of application or termination to comply with regulatory requirements.
6. International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to and maintained outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. For instance, as Globalstar, Inc. is a US company, information about our customers is kept in the US. We therefore seek to ensure that all adequate safeguards are in place and that all applicable laws and regulations are complied with in connection with such transfers. For transferring personal information from the EU to countries outside the EU, Globalstar uses agreements based on EU Model Clauses, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and, when they receive authorization from the appropriate Swiss and UK authorities, will use the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”). Globalstar ensures that personal information processed in this way is protected, in accordance with applicable law. If you want a copy of the standard EU Model Clauses, you can ask us by email to the email address below.
Globalstar, Inc. has certiﬁed to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, please visit
www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/
. We are committed to processing any personal data received from the EU, UK, or Switzerland in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework in accordance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles including notice, choice, accountability for onward transfers, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement, and liability. If there is any conﬂict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles (including the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF) and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. All Globalstar companies are required to follow the privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Statement.
If you have a Data Privacy Framework-related complaint or inquiry, please contact us at
privacy@globalstar.com
. As part of our participation in Data Privacy Framework, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Data Privacy Framework Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, or alternatively through the independent dispute resolution body,
JAMS Alternative Dispute Resolution
, and under certain conditions through the Data Privacy Framework arbitration process.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
.
Under certain conditions (more fully described at
www.dataprivacyframework.gov
), you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration where other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
Data Privacy Framework participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other US authorized statutory bodies. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Under certain circumstances, Globalstar, Inc. may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, UK, or Switzerland to third parties outside the EU, UK, and Switzerland.
Under the Data Privacy Framework Principles, you have the right, with respect to any personal information subject to our certiﬁcation under the Data Privacy Framework, to opt out of: (i) disclosures of your personal information to third parties (other than our agents that are performing tasks on our behalf under our instructions); or (ii) uses of your personal information for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
If we receive personal information subject to our certiﬁcation under the Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Data Privacy Framework if both (i) the agent processes the personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
7. Our Policy Toward Children
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without his/her consent, he or she should contact us at
privacy@globalstar.com
(see 'Your Rights and Contacting Us' below) in order to conﬁrm our authorization or to object to the processing. We may follow up by phone or other means in some circumstances. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal Information, we will delete such information from our ﬁles.
8. Your Rights
Depending on where you are located, applicable law may give you various rights regarding your information (though these are subject to various limitations and exceptions). These include:
the right to access and to obtain information regarding the processing of your personal information we control;
the right to correct your personal information where it is inaccurate;
the right to have your personal information deleted;
the right to restrict processing of your personal information;
the right to object to processing, including for direct marketing purposes;
the right to data portability; and
the right to withdraw any consent you give us or unsubscribe from marketing messages.
Certain information may be exempt from such rights under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Globalstar services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Globalstar services. You may be required to provide additional information to verify your identity before we fulﬁll your request.
If you wish to contact us or exercise your rights, you may submit a request through this link:
Data Subject Request

Applicable law may also permit you to appeal any denials of your rights requests; to do so, contact us as described above and provide details why you believe the denial was in error. Your description must include your full name and the email address to obtain the Globalstar services from us, along with a copy of the denial notice you received from us.
You may also have the right to opt out of the use of your information for targeted advertising. Targeted advertising (as deﬁned by applicable law) is advertising based on a consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites to predict the consumer’s preferences or interests. You may also have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your information, as that term is deﬁned by applicable law. To opt out of targeted advertising or “sales,” please visit this link:

9. Notice to California Residents
If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding how we collect, use, and share your “personal information” and “sensitive personal information” (as deﬁned in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).
We describe the categories of information we collect, our business purposes for collecting such information, the sources and uses of such information and the entities to which we share such information in the
Personal Information We Collect
,
Use of Your Personal Information
, and
Disclosure of Your Personal Information
sections of this Privacy Notice. We provide additional information below.
Categories of personal information we collect, use and disclose
. Throughout this Policy, we discuss in detail the types of Information we collect from and about users and discuss how we use and share such information. See “
Personal Information We Collect
” for more details. The following are the “categories” of personal information under the CCPA that we collect and that we may, as discussed throughout this Policy, use and disclose for our business purposes: Identiﬁers (such as name, address, email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); ﬁnancial data (such as credit card information); device identiﬁers (such as IP address and unique device identiﬁers); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or app usage (such as your notes and highlights in the Services)); physical characteristics or description (such as voluntarily submitted proﬁle photo); audio information (such as recorded calls with our Customer Relations team); limited medical information (Such as voluntarily provided medication allergies to be used in an emergency situation, or details related to an SOS call); general and precise geolocation data; any user-generated content or feedback you provide; professional or employment related data; and other information that identiﬁes or can be reasonably associated with you.
The categories of sensitive personal information are account log-in and password, ﬁnancial data, other credentials allowing access to your account, precise geolocation, and health information.
How we use these categories of personal information.
We use the categories of personal information we collect from and about you consistent with the various business purposes we discuss throughout this Policy. See “Use of Your Personal Information” for more details.
Sources of these categories of personal information.
We collect the categories of personal information identiﬁed above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the Services; (3) affiliates; and (4) third parties such as ﬁnancial institutions, credit bureaus, and trade credit or job references.
How we disclose these categories of personal information.
We describe our information disclosure practices above. We may disclose certain categories of personal information to third parties (as deﬁned by the CCPA) for the business purposes described above. For example, we may disclose your identiﬁers and precision geolocation to ﬁrst responders for Search & Rescue, and your identiﬁers and internet or other network or device activity with dealers for the purpose of determining and verifying commissions and maintaining business records.
California Privacy Rights
California residents can make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA. Speciﬁcally, if you are a California resident, you may request that we:
provide you with information about the categories of personal information we collect, disclose or sell about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information. Such information is also set forth in this Notice.
provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;
correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you;
delete certain information we have about you; and/or
provide you with information about the ﬁnancial incentives that we offer to you, if any.
The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.
Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Globalstar services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Globalstar services.
If you would like to exercise any of legal rights under the CCPA, please complete the form linked here:
Data Subject Request
, or contact us through Customer Relations
here
. You will be required to verify your identity before we fulﬁll your request. If you have an online account with us, providing account details and other requested information will serve to verify your identity and request, although we may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
Sale of personal information.
The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is deﬁned under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such sales. Some people have taken the position that when a website uses third parties’ cookies or similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing personal information to the third party. As part of these analytics and advertising services, these technologies may access identiﬁers (like IP addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Site), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing the Globalstar services). While Globalstar does not believe these are “sales” as that term is deﬁned under the CCPA, you can opt out of this activity. You can opt out of these activities by visiting this link:
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
, or by emailing us at
privacy@globalstar.com
.
Sharing of personal information.
The CCPA also requires businesses that "share“ personal information to provide an opt out from such sharing. Under the CCPA,” sharing” is deﬁned as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites. We “share” information for these purposes to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding the Globalstar services. As part of this advertising, we may "share“ identiﬁers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our websites), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing the Globalstar services) with advertising platforms and advertising networks. To opt out of such “sharing,” please visit this link:
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
, or by emailing us at
privacy@globalstar.com
.
Global Privacy Control.
Please note that we also respond to and abide by opt-out preference signals sent through the Global Privacy Control
.
Any opt out preferences you have exercised through these methods will only apply to the speciﬁc device/browser on which you made them. For more information on how to use the Global Privacy Control, see
www.globalprivacycontrol.org
.
Children under 16.
We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of children under 16. We will only “sell” or “share” such personal information if we receive express consent to do so from those aged 13 to 16 years of age.
Sensitive Personal Information.
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as deﬁned in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.
Retention of Your Personal Information
Please see the “Data Retention” section above.
Notice of Financial Incentive
We provide certain rewards or incentives for providing your email address or referring contacts and may occasionally run sweepstakes and contests where participants may provide personal information in return for a chance to win or compete to win certain prizes. You can opt into these incentives, sweepstakes, or contests by taking the requested action. Your participation is completely voluntary, and you have a right to withdraw from these incentives at any time. If you decide you don’t want to participate in these ﬁnancial incentives, you can refrain from taking the requested actions.
The speciﬁc reward or incentive offered, if any, is made available to you when you provide the information requested or submit a review. The monetary value of the reward or incentive is a reasonable approximation of the monetary value of the information you provide us. We have arrived at this estimate based on consideration of multiple factors, including the following: (1) revenue generated by Globalstar in developing insights on our customers; (2) expenses incurred by Globalstar in operating the incentives; and (3) our reasonable assessment of revenue we may generate as a result of the referrals provided to us by our customers.

10. Notice to Nevada Residents

Globalstar does not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from Globalstar, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing us at

12. Who is responsible for my information?

When we say “Globalstar”, “us”, “we”, or “our/ours” in this notice, we mean Globalstar, Inc. unless:
you have a contract with Globalstar Europe Satellite Services Limited, in which case we mean both Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Europe Satellite Services as joint controllers – see section 13 for more information in this regard;
you work for a supplier to another Globalstar entity and we accordingly hold limited information about you such as your job title and contact details, in which case we mean that other Globalstar entity;

Spot LLC, a subsidiary of Globalstar, Inc. contracts with certain Globalstar customers. Globalstar, Inc. is the main decision maker with respect to how any such customers’ personal information is handled and is the point of contact with respect to personal information of Spot LLC’s customers.

Ireland. Globalstar, Inc., which holds your personal information, is accessible at 1351 Holiday Square Blvd., Covington, LA 70433.
13. Joint control of EU data
Globalstar Europe Satellite Services Limited (“
Globalstar Ireland
”), an Irish company established in the EU, contracts with certain Globalstar customers whose related personal data is within the scope of the GDPR (“
EU Data
”). Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Ireland jointly control EU Data.
As between Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Ireland, Globalstar, Inc. is the main decision maker with respect to the processing of EU Data and is primarily responsible for fulﬁlling the controller responsibilities with respect to EU Data, with assistance from Globalstar Ireland where required. For example, Globalstar, Inc. is the primary decision maker regarding what and why EU Data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained and other decisions regarding it and, as between it and Globalstar Ireland, primarily responsible for making sure this is done in accordance with the GDPR. Globalstar, Inc., as between Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Ireland, is also primarily responsible for informing you how Globalstar processes your EU Data (including by providing this notice), deciding how to implement data subject requests and, where necessary, primarily engaging with data protection supervisory authorities and making notiﬁcations to them and data subjects. Globalstar Ireland assists Globalstar, Inc. in this regard.
Globalstar Ireland implements the decisions of Globalstar, Inc. with respect to the processing of EU Data and acts as the main establishment in the EU of Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Ireland with respect to the processing of jointly controlled EU Data. The Irish Data Protection Commission is the lead supervisory authority with respect to EU Data. Globalstar Ireland also engages directly with customers with respect to certain functions such as billing and customer services.
Globalstar Inc. is the main point of contact for data subjects with respect to EU Data so, for example, it is best to contact Globalstar Inc. if you want to exercise your data subject rights under the GDPR with respect to EU Data. Its contact details are set out in section 12 above. Irrespective of this arrangement, you can exercise your rights under the GDPR against either Globalstar, Inc., or Globalstar Ireland with respect to EU Data.

If you have any questions or concerns about how such information is handled or would like to exercise your rights, you should contact the enterprise customer who has contracted with us to use the Globalstar services to process your information. Our enterprise customers determine how and for what purpose the information collected on their behalf should be processed. We will, however, assist our enterprise customers in addressing any concerns you may have, in accordance with the terms of our contract with them.

We do this based upon those legal requirements or our legitimate interest in that regard.
Consent
. Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use your personal data for purposes for which you have provided consent.
3. Disclosure of Your Personal Information
We may disclosure your personal information to:
Affiliates
. Your personal information may be disclosed to our parent corporation or certain other affiliates for internal audit, management, billing or administrative purposes. Globalstar, Inc. and some of its affiliates are located outside of the European Economic Area, so Globalstar may transfer and process your personal information to countries other than your country of residence. For more information, please see the "International Transfer" section below.
Your Dealer
. Your dealer may have access to the information you provide in your service application form which it collects from you as a part of the sign-up process. In addition, certain account and usage information, such as service phone number, traffic details and/or activation status may be disclosed by Globalstar to your dealer for the purpose of determining and verifying commissions and maintaining business records. Our dealers are independent businesses and responsible for how they use your information – you should check their privacy notice for more information on how they use your information.
Globalstar does not control and is not responsible for what they do with your personal information. If you have questions or concerns about how those independent businesses use or disclose your personal information, you need to contact them directly.
Service Providers and Professional Advisers
. Globalstar may transfer personal information to outside agents or service providers (including affiliates of Globalstar acting in this capacity) that perform services on our behalf, for example billing, mailing, collection or information technology hosting or processing services, as well as our professional advisers (who are often independent ‘data controllers’) such as lawyers and accountants. Some of these may be located outside of the European Economic Area and your personal information may be collected, used, disclosed, stored and processed in the U.S. or other jurisdictions outside of the European Economic Area for the purposes described in this notice.
Process payments
. We transmit your personal information via an encrypted connection to our payment processors.
Mergers and Business Transactions
. Your personal information may be used by Globalstar and disclosed to parties connected with the contemplated or actual ﬁnancing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets (including, for example, your service account with us), for purposes related to the evaluation and performance of these transactions or to give effect to them, including:
permitting such parties to determine whether to proceed or continue with the transaction;
fulﬁlling reporting, inspection or audit requirements or obligations to such parties; and
the use and disclosure of your personal information by such parties for substantially the same purposes as described in this statement.
Other Recipients
. Globalstar may otherwise disclose personal information as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, insurance, audit, processing and security requirements as permitted or required by law. This may include disclosing personal information to law enforcement authorities where Globalstar has a legal obligation to do so, or it is otherwise permitted by applicable law, or we considered it appropriate to do so. We do this to comply with our legal obligations and in our and others’ legitimate interests in protecting the property, rights, name and safety of us and others.
4. Cookies and tracking technologies
Our site makes use of cookies and similar technologies in accordance with our
Cookie Notice
.
5. Data Retention
We retain your information for the period necessary to fulﬁl the purposes outlined in this notice or such longer retention period as may be required or permitted by applicable law. For instance, we may keep your information to comply with our legal obligations (e.g. tax laws), to resolve disputes, to enforce our contracts or as otherwise permitted by law.
The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it, and applicable law. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to a contract or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, where we are using your personal information in order to provide you with services / products and perform our contract with you, we normally retain the relevant information for the duration of the contract and a period of 7 years after that. After that period, we normally anonymize or de-identify and aggregate the data and then use it in its anonymized or aggregated form for internal research and analysis. Where personal information is provided to request direct marketing and similar materials from Globalstar, we keep that personal information until you ask us not to send any further such materials. We will keep a record of any request not to receive these materials to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in the future. When you apply for a job, we keep your CV and other information for 10 years after the date of application or termination to comply with regulatory requirements.
6. International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to and maintained outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. For instance, as Globalstar, Inc. is a US company, information about our customers is kept in the US. We therefore seek to ensure that all adequate safeguards are in place and that all applicable laws and regulations are complied with in connection with such transfers. For transferring personal information from the EU to countries outside the EU, Globalstar uses agreements based on EU Model Clauses, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and, when they receive authorization from the appropriate Swiss and UK authorities, will use the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”). Globalstar ensures that personal information processed in this way is protected, in accordance with applicable law. If you want a copy of the standard EU Model Clauses, you can ask us by email to the email address below.
Globalstar, Inc. has certiﬁed to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, please visit
www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/
. We are committed to processing any personal data received from the EU, UK, or Switzerland in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework in accordance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles including notice, choice, accountability for onward transfers, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement, and liability. If there is any conﬂict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles (including the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF) and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. All Globalstar companies are required to follow the privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Statement.
If you have a Data Privacy Framework-related complaint or inquiry, please contact us at
privacy@globalstar.com
. As part of our participation in Data Privacy Framework, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Data Privacy Framework Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, or alternatively through the independent dispute resolution body,
JAMS Alternative Dispute Resolution
, and under certain conditions through the Data Privacy Framework arbitration process.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
.
Under certain conditions (more fully described at
www.dataprivacyframework.gov
), you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration where other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
Data Privacy Framework participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other US authorized statutory bodies. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Under certain circumstances, Globalstar, Inc. may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, UK, or Switzerland to third parties outside the EU, UK, and Switzerland.
Under the Data Privacy Framework Principles, you have the right, with respect to any personal information subject to our certiﬁcation under the Data Privacy Framework, to opt out of: (i) disclosures of your personal information to third parties (other than our agents that are performing tasks on our behalf under our instructions); or (ii) uses of your personal information for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
If we receive personal information subject to our certiﬁcation under the Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Data Privacy Framework if both (i) the agent processes the personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
7. Our Policy Toward Children
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without his/her consent, he or she should contact us at
privacy@globalstar.com
(see 'Your Rights and Contacting Us' below) in order to conﬁrm our authorization or to object to the processing. We may follow up by phone or other means in some circumstances. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal Information, we will delete such information from our ﬁles.
8. Your Rights
Depending on where you are located, applicable law may give you various rights regarding your information (though these are subject to various limitations and exceptions). These include:
the right to access and to obtain information regarding the processing of your personal information we control;
the right to correct your personal information where it is inaccurate;
the right to have your personal information deleted;
the right to restrict processing of your personal information;
the right to object to processing, including for direct marketing purposes;
the right to data portability; and
the right to withdraw any consent you give us or unsubscribe from marketing messages.
Certain information may be exempt from such rights under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Globalstar services to you.

You may be required to provide additional information to verify your identity before we fulﬁll your request.

You may also have the right to opt out of the use of your information for targeted advertising. Targeted advertising (as deﬁned by applicable law) is advertising based on a consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites to predict the consumer’s preferences or interests. You may also have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your information, as that term is deﬁned by applicable law. To opt out of targeted advertising or “sales,” please visit this link:

9. Notice to California Residents
If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding how we collect, use, and share your “personal information” and “sensitive personal information” (as deﬁned in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).
We describe the categories of information we collect, our business purposes for collecting such information, the sources and uses of such information and the entities to which we share such information in the
Personal Information We Collect
,
Use of Your Personal Information
, and
Disclosure of Your Personal Information
sections of this Privacy Notice. We provide additional information below.
Categories of personal information we collect, use and disclose
. Throughout this Policy, we discuss in detail the types of Information we collect from and about users and discuss how we use and share such information. See “
Personal Information We Collect
” for more details. The following are the “categories” of personal information under the CCPA that we collect and that we may, as discussed throughout this Policy, use and disclose for our business purposes: Identiﬁers (such as name, address, email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); ﬁnancial data (such as credit card information); device identiﬁers (such as IP address and unique device identiﬁers); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or app usage (such as your notes and highlights in the Services)); physical characteristics or description (such as voluntarily submitted proﬁle photo); audio information (such as recorded calls with our Customer Relations team); limited medical information (Such as voluntarily provided medication allergies to be used in an emergency situation, or details related to an SOS call); general and precise geolocation data; any user-generated content or feedback you provide; professional or employment related data; and other information that identiﬁes or can be reasonably associated with you.
The categories of sensitive personal information are account log-in and password, ﬁnancial data, other credentials allowing access to your account, precise geolocation, and health information.
How we use these categories of personal information.
We use the categories of personal information we collect from and about you consistent with the various business purposes we discuss throughout this Policy. See “Use of Your Personal Information” for more details.
Sources of these categories of personal information.
We collect the categories of personal information identiﬁed above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the Services; (3) affiliates; and (4) third parties such as ﬁnancial institutions, credit bureaus, and trade credit or job references.
How we disclose these categories of personal information.
We describe our information disclosure practices above. We may disclose certain categories of personal information to third parties (as deﬁned by the CCPA) for the business purposes described above. For example, we may disclose your identiﬁers and precision geolocation to ﬁrst responders for Search & Rescue, and your identiﬁers and internet or other network or device activity with dealers for the purpose of determining and verifying commissions and maintaining business records.
California Privacy Rights
California residents can make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA. Speciﬁcally, if you are a California resident, you may request that we:
provide you with information about the categories of personal information we collect, disclose or sell about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information. Such information is also set forth in this Notice.
provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;
correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you;
delete certain information we have about you; and/or
provide you with information about the ﬁnancial incentives that we offer to you, if any.
The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.
Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Globalstar services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Globalstar services.
If you would like to exercise any of legal rights under the CCPA, please complete the form linked here:
Data Subject Request
, or contact us through Customer Relations
here
. You will be required to verify your identity before we fulﬁll your request. If you have an online account with us, providing account details and other requested information will serve to verify your identity and request, although we may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
Sale of personal information.
The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is deﬁned under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such sales. Some people have taken the position that when a website uses third parties’ cookies or similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing personal information to the third party. As part of these analytics and advertising services, these technologies may access identiﬁers (like IP addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Site), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing the Globalstar services). While Globalstar does not believe these are “sales” as that term is deﬁned under the CCPA, you can opt out of this activity. You can opt out of these activities by visiting this link:
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
, or by emailing us at
privacy@globalstar.com
.
Sharing of personal information.
The CCPA also requires businesses that "share“ personal information to provide an opt out from such sharing. Under the CCPA,” sharing” is deﬁned as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites. We “share” information for these purposes to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding the Globalstar services. As part of this advertising, we may "share“ identiﬁers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our websites), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing the Globalstar services) with advertising platforms and advertising networks. To opt out of such “sharing,” please visit this link:
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
, or by emailing us at
privacy@globalstar.com
.
Global Privacy Control.
Please note that we also respond to and abide by opt-out preference signals sent through the Global Privacy Control
.
Any opt out preferences you have exercised through these methods will only apply to the speciﬁc device/browser on which you made them. For more information on how to use the Global Privacy Control, see
www.globalprivacycontrol.org
.
Children under 16.
We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of children under 16. We will only “sell” or “share” such personal information if we receive express consent to do so from those aged 13 to 16 years of age.
Sensitive Personal Information.
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as deﬁned in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.
Retention of Your Personal Information
Please see the “Data Retention” section above.
Notice of Financial Incentive
We provide certain rewards or incentives for providing your email address or referring contacts and may occasionally run sweepstakes and contests where participants may provide personal information in return for a chance to win or compete to win certain prizes. You can opt into these incentives, sweepstakes, or contests by taking the requested action. Your participation is completely voluntary, and you have a right to withdraw from these incentives at any time. If you decide you don’t want to participate in these ﬁnancial incentives, you can refrain from taking the requested actions.
The speciﬁc reward or incentive offered, if any, is made available to you when you provide the information requested or submit a review. The monetary value of the reward or incentive is a reasonable approximation of the monetary value of the information you provide us. We have arrived at this estimate based on consideration of multiple factors, including the following: (1) revenue generated by Globalstar in developing insights on our customers; (2) expenses incurred by Globalstar in operating the incentives; and (3) our reasonable assessment of revenue we may generate as a result of the referrals provided to us by our customers.

10. Notice to Nevada Residents
Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “covered information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Covered information” includes ﬁrst and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identiﬁer that allows a speciﬁc person to be contacted either physically or online.
Globalstar does not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from Globalstar, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing us at

12. Who is responsible for my information?
Globalstar is responsible for your personal information.
When we say “Globalstar”, “us”, “we”, or “our/ours” in this notice, we mean Globalstar, Inc. unless:
you have a contract with Globalstar Europe Satellite Services Limited, in which case we mean both Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Europe Satellite Services as joint controllers – see section 13 for more information in this regard;
you work for a supplier to another Globalstar entity and we accordingly hold limited information about you such as your job title and contact details, in which case we mean that other Globalstar entity;

Spot LLC, a subsidiary of Globalstar, Inc. contracts with certain Globalstar customers. Globalstar, Inc. is the main decision maker with respect to how any such customers’ personal information is handled and is the point of contact with respect to personal information of Spot LLC’s customers.
Globalstar Europe Satellite Services Limited’s registered company number is 361768 and its registered office is at Unit 10, The Hyde Building, The Park, Carrickmines, Dublin 18,
Ireland. Globalstar, Inc., which holds your personal information, is accessible at 1351 Holiday Square Blvd., Covington, LA 70433.
13. Joint control of EU data
Globalstar Europe Satellite Services Limited (“
Globalstar Ireland
”), an Irish company established in the EU, contracts with certain Globalstar customers whose related personal data is within the scope of the GDPR (“
EU Data
”). Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Ireland jointly control EU Data.
As between Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Ireland, Globalstar, Inc. is the main decision maker with respect to the processing of EU Data and is primarily responsible for fulﬁlling the controller responsibilities with respect to EU Data, with assistance from Globalstar Ireland where required. For example, Globalstar, Inc. is the primary decision maker regarding what and why EU Data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained and other decisions regarding it and, as between it and Globalstar Ireland, primarily responsible for making sure this is done in accordance with the GDPR. Globalstar, Inc., as between Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Ireland, is also primarily responsible for informing you how Globalstar processes your EU Data (including by providing this notice), deciding how to implement data subject requests and, where necessary, primarily engaging with data protection supervisory authorities and making notiﬁcations to them and data subjects. Globalstar Ireland assists Globalstar, Inc. in this regard.
Globalstar Ireland implements the decisions of Globalstar, Inc. with respect to the processing of EU Data and acts as the main establishment in the EU of Globalstar, Inc. and Globalstar Ireland with respect to the processing of jointly controlled EU Data. The Irish Data Protection Commission is the lead supervisory authority with respect to EU Data. Globalstar Ireland also engages directly with customers with respect to certain functions such as billing and customer services.
Globalstar Inc. is the main point of contact for data subjects with respect to EU Data so, for example, it is best to contact Globalstar Inc. if you want to exercise your data subject rights under the GDPR with respect to EU Data.

GPC
Enable Global Privacy Control to communicate your privacy preference.
Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
