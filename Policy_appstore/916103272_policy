Overcome Limitations
Home screen widgets on iOS 15 do not allow in-place interactions but we found a solution.
A unique approach allows you to begin calculations from the home screen widget, finish in the app and quickly return without losing your context.
Widgets But Smol Apps Really
Each widget is a full fledged app with it's own iCloud sync, search, history, action extensions and more.
