This notice only applies to residents of California.
Privacy Information
The California Consumer Privacy Act (‚ÄúCCPA‚Äù) requires us to provide you with certain information about:
The categories of ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù (as defined in the CCPA) that we collect;
The purposes for which we use each category of personal information;
The categories of third parties to which we disclose such personal information for a business purpose; and
The categories of third parties to which we disclose such personal information in a way that may constitute ‚Äúsharing‚Äù of information for ‚Äúcross-context behavioral advertising‚Äù and/or ‚Äúselling‚Äù of information (each as defined under CCPA).
Under the CCPA, ‚Äúsharing‚Äù is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer‚Äôs personal information obtained from the consumer‚Äôs activity across websites, and ‚Äúselling‚Äù is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.
Our use of certain third-party providers, which are described more fully in the ‚ÄúCookies, Online Analytics, and Online Advertising‚Äù section in our
Privacy Statement
, may result in the disclosure of online identifiers (ex: cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a ‚Äúsale‚Äù or "sharing" under the CCPA.
Please see the chart at the end of this notice for the required privacy information details.
To learn more about each category of personal information, the purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose personal information, please see the "Why we Process Personal Information," "What Personal Information we Process," and "To Whom We Disclose Information" sections of our
Privacy Statement
.
‚ÄúSale‚Äù/‚ÄúShare Opt Out Rights
You have the right to opt out of our sale and/or sharing of your personal information.
To opt out of any such disclosures made through the use of cookies/pixels please click on the 'Your Privacy Choices' link on the footer of Site for the particular Services you use. To opt out of any such disclosures made through other means, please email us at privacy@mural.co.
Please note that if you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as a global privacy control) we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Other CCPA Rights
If we ever offer any financial incentives in exchange for your personal information, we will provide you with appropriate information about such incentives.
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your ‚Äúsensitive personal information‚Äù (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. ¬†Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for business purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.
Finally, the CCPA also permits you to request that we:
provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you
update information which is out of date or incorrect
delete certain information that we are holding about you
restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information
Please see the ‚ÄúYour Rights And Your Choices‚Äù section of our
Privacy Statement
for information about how to exercise these rights.
Retention of Your Personal Information
Please see the ‚ÄúRetention Of Your Information‚Äù section of the Privacy Statement.
Do Not Track Notice
Do Not Track (‚ÄúDNT‚Äù) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about
Do Not Track
.
Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the legally-required user ‚Äúpreference signal‚Äù referenced above, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes (such as the ‚Äúsale‚Äù of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes) under applicable law.
Shine the Light Disclosure
The California "Shine the Light" law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we disclose certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We currently do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
