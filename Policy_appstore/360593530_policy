We collect Personal Data about you from the following categories of sources:

When you provide such information directly to us
When you create an account or use our interactive tools and Services.
When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Services or through responses to surveys or questionnaires.
When you send us an email or otherwise contact us.
When you make your User Submission (such as shared notes) viewable to us, other users of the Services, or the general public.
When you use the Services and such information is collected automatically.
Through Cookies (defined in the
Tracking Tools and Opt-Out
section below).
If you download our mobile application or use a browser, we may receive information about your location and mobile device, as applicable.
When you use the "voice recording” function available in the Services.
Some of the Services, such as the Notability app and website, provide an audio transcription functionality that allows you to upload the voice recordings created on your devices to our servers for converting such voice recordings into text transcripts.
In order to provide the audio transcription feature, the audio recordings will be temporarily processed and stored on our servers solely for the purpose of providing the transcription feature. We do not access, listen to, or review the audio recordings beyond the automated transcription process, and we do not use nor disclose the audio recordings with any third parties for any other purposes (such as for training AI/ML models) without your consent, except where as required to fulfill our legal obligations under applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process. We follow industry practice to delete the audio recordings once the transcription process is complete.
We store and process the resulting text transcripts only to provide the Services to you, including for your future use and reference, to make such transcripts accessible to you upon your request, or in response to a related customer support request submitted by or for you. Other than as described in the foregoing, we do not access, view, use, or disclose the transcribed texts with any third parties, for any other purposes (such as for training AI/ML models), except where as required to fulfill our legal obligations under applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process.
The audio transcription feature is entirely optional. We do not require you to submit any voice recordings, but you can voluntarily opt to use such functionality to create a text transcript of your recording. If you wish to delete any of your text transcripts stored on our server, please refer to the section
Exercising Your Rights
below and follow the steps there to submit a deletion request.
When you use the "Notability Learn" function available in the Services.
Some of the Services, such as the Notability app, provide a study material generation functionality that allows you to upload note content, such as audio transcripts, text, handwriting content, and PDF content on your devices (the “Input Content”) to our Services for using such Input Content to generate study materials, such as summaries and quizzes (the “Generated Content”).
In order to provide the study material generation feature, the Input Content will be processed through the Services, which may be powered by AI technologies provided by our service providers (the “AI Providers”) and stored on our servers (as well as servers of such AI Providers) solely for the purpose of performing the study material generation and enabling the “Notability Learn” feature. We do not access, read, or review the Input Content beyond the automated study materials generation process, and we do not use nor share the Input Content with any third parties for any other purposes (such as for training AI/ML models), except for sharing to or from AI Providers for their performance of services to us or where as required to fulfill our legal obligations under applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process. We delete the Input Content once the study material generation process is complete.
We store and process the resulting Generated Content only to provide the Services to you, including for your future use and reference, to make such materials available to you upon your request, or in response to a related customer support request submitted by or for you. Other than as described in the foregoing, we do not access, view, use, or share the Generated Content with any third parties, for any other purposes (such as for training AI/ML models), except for sharing to or from AI Providers for their performance of services to us or where as required to fulfill our legal obligations under applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process.
The study material generation feature is entirely optional. We do not require you to submit any note content, but you can voluntarily opt to use such functionality to create study materials from your notes. If you wish to delete any of your Generated Content stored on our server, please refer to the Section “Exercising Your Rights” below and follow the steps there to submit a deletion request.

Terms of Use
, you represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Input Content or other content that contains Prohibited Data in connection with your use of the Services, except that the foregoing doesn’t prohibit you from storing or processing such data on (and only on) your local device(s). We reserve the right to disable all the features that allow you to submit any data/content to our servers if you violate the foregoing, and repetitive violations of the foregoing is ground for termination of your right to use or access the Services.
"Prohibited Data" means:
protected health information or personal health data (e.g. medical records or an individual's health care claim information);
non-public, government-issued ID numbers (e.g. driver's license numbers, Social Security Numbers);
personal financial data or financial account numbers (e.g. account numbers for a personal debit card or credit card);

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data.

We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
You may submit a Valid Request at

We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.
Contractual Necessity
: We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.
Profile or Contact Data (if you elect to use our services that enable the sharing of the notes you created through our applications)
Legitimate Interest

Profile or Contact Data
Online Identifiers
Device/IP Data
Web Analytics
Age
Geolocation Data
Other Identifying Information that You Voluntarily Choose to Provide
We may also de-identify or anonymize Personal Data to further our legitimate interests.
Examples of these legitimate interests include (as described in more detail above):
Providing, customizing, and improving the Services.
Performing internal analytics of the Services for product use analysis, product performance enhancement, and product development.
Providing technical support, customer support, troubleshooting, and other services.
Corresponding with you, and responding to your requests.
Meeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms.
Completing corporate transactions.
Protecting information, system, network, and cyber security
Consent
: In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.
Other Processing Grounds
: From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.

How We Disclose Your Personal Data
section above details how we disclose your Personal Data with third parties.

In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.
Access
:  You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data.
Rectification
:  If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data.
Erasure
:  You can request that we erase some or all of your Personal Data from our systems.

Transfers of Personal Data
The Services are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Notability and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Notability in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Notability to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. In some circumstances, your Personal Data may be transferred to the U.S. pursuant to a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses and/or the Data Privacy Framework(s), as discussed below.
Data Privacy Framework(s)
Notability complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (“UK-U.S. DPF”), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Notability has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of all personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (the “EU-UK DPF Principles”). Notability has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-UK DPF Principles, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-UK DPF Principles, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-US DPF, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Notability’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the EU-UK DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, the purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Data, and the purposes for which we disclose your Personal Data to certain types of third parties in the sections above.  Pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF, the EU-UK DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain Personal Data relating to them in the U.S. Upon request, we will provide EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with access to the Personal Data that we hold about them. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals may also correct, amend, or delete the Personal Data we hold about them where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-UK DPF Principles, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. An EU, UK, and Swiss individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the U.S. under the EU-U.S. DPF, the EU-UK DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, should direct their query to
support@gingerlabs.com
. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. For more information about rights afforded to EU, UK, and Swiss individuals, please see the
European Union, United Kingdom, and Swiss Data Subject Rights
section of this Privacy Policy.
In addition, under the EU-U.S. DPF, the EU-UK DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, we will provide EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with the choice to opt-out from the sharing of their Personal Data with any third parties (other than our agents or those that act on our behalf or under our instruction), or before we use it for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
In addition to any other disclosures described in our Privacy Policy, in certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Notability’s accountability for Personal Data that it receives in the U.S. under the EU-U.S. DPF, the EU-UK DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf is described in the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-UK DPF Principles, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles. In particular, Notability remains liable under the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-UK DPF Principles, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles if our agents process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-UK DPF Principles, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, unless Notability proves that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the EU-UK DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Notability commits to resolve EU-U.S. DPF Principles, EU-UK DPF Principles, and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your Personal Data. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPF should first contact Notability at
support@gingerlabs.com
.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the EU-UK DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Notability commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the EU-UK DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the U.S. If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual and you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your EU-U.S. DPF Principles, EU-UK DPF Principles, or Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your EU-U.S. DPF Principles, EU-UK DPF Principles, or Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
If your EU-U.S. DPF, EU-UK DPF, or Swiss-U.S. DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Annex 1 of the Data Privacy Framework Principles, located at
