Our privacy commitment
At Trimble, we are committed to your privacy. We know that we must earn your trust—and keep it—every time you use Trimble products and services to transform the way the world works. To make good on that promise, we’ve created this Privacy Center, where you’ll learn all about our approach to your privacy.
The Trimble Office of Data Protection works to ensure that your personal data is collected, shared and handled the right way. Please read our complete Privacy Notice for details on what this means to you. We start with a commitment to:
Being transparent in how and when we collect - and use your personal data
Simplifying our policies so they are easy to understand
Making sure you have control of your data at all times
Trimble's products and services are intended for commercial use, however, we often make our products available for students as a part of their higher learning curriculum. Due to the increased focus on the security and protection of student information, we make sure that our privacy practices comply with federal and global regulations.
This Privacy Center and our Privacy Notice does not cover other organizations' sites that may be accessible via links from our sites. These sites have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to read them. We may often modify our Privacy Notice to update legal, technological and other developments. In that event, the changes will appear at this location.
Our customers have trusted us with their personal information for over 40 years, and we are committed to ensuring that you feel just as secure today. Your trust is our top priority. If you have a privacy question or concern, please contact Trimble Office of Data Protection.

FULL NOTICE
I. How and to whom does this Notice Apply?
Our Privacy Notice applies to all Trimble websites and to our web-based or mobile apps that reference this notice, either in the information provided with them or the contractual terms that govern your use of these apps. Some web-based apps may have a more specific privacy notice. Generally, Trimble Inc. and its affiliates are responsible for the processing of your personal information. However, some subsidiaries of Trimble may operate under their own privacy notices or a privacy notice which supplements this Trimble Privacy Notice.
This Privacy Notice applies to the processing of personal information submitted to us by, provided to us by, or otherwise collected by us from visitors and users of the various Trimble products, sites, services, attendees of Trimble events, customers and prospective customers and their representatives; subscribers to Trimble newsletters; and suppliers and business partners and their representatives. This Privacy Notice describes how we process personal data for our own purposes. We also process personal data on behalf of our customers subject to a written contract.

B. How Does Trimble Obtain Your Information
Information is collected directly from you through personal interactions, registrations for events or websites, or correspondence with us. Information is collected from your interactions with and use of our websites, apps, and products and services. We obtain information through our resellers and other channel partners. We complement information we receive directly from you with information from other sources, in accordance with applicable law. For example, we use data about the company you work for together with the information received from you to better understand the industry that you are working in. Furthermore, we obtain contact details, professional information, commercial information and behavioral data from business contact databases, publicly available resources, social networking websites and marketing service providers.
C. Some Processing Practices explained in Detail
Trimble ID
Trimble ID is our single sign on functionality. We process your contact details and login details such as user name and password. The purpose of this processing is to provide you access to our products and services to which you or your employer have purchased or subscribed.
Trimble Products, Software Services, Apps and Subscription Websites
Trimble offers various services to our customers. The data processed in the context of these services is processed generally on behalf of our customers (who may be your employer). When you use these services, Trimble will process the following data:
Usage Details. When you access our websites or use our apps, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the websites and apps, including location data, logs, back-end information and server calls, communication data, and the resources that you access and use on or through the websites and apps. The purpose for processing this information is to manage, secure and improve our products and services.
Device Information. Our servers may receive data from your browser or device when you visit one of our websites or use an app. That data can include your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located), device ID, operating systems, pages viewed, time spent, the type of browser and device you used, as well as the referring website, and if applicable, the search terms that led you to our website.
We require some of this usage and device information to provide you and our customers with certain functionality of our products, software, services, websites and apps.  If you do not want us to collect or process this usage and device information, do not use our products, software, services, access our websites, or download our app, or delete our app from your device if already downloaded.
Also, we use automated systems to analyze your use of our products, software, services, websites and apps using techniques such as machine learning in order to improve our products, software, services, apps and websites. This analysis may occur as the content is sent or received using an online feature of a Trimble app or website, or when the content is stored on Trimble servers.
Trimble app activation and automatic updates
When you are registered to use a Trimble product (software or hardware) for which we provide updates to you, we may process information about your Trimble product and any product on which you may have it installed (including your IP address), and your product serial number. Some of our apps connect to our servers and offer you the ability to install updates to the app, either in the background or upon your confirmation. We may keep track of information such as whether an update was successful or not. We may also use information collected through activation or app updates to validate that you hold a valid license to our product and confirm that it is genuine and properly licensed.
Trimble Emails and Marketing Automation
Trimble uses marketing automation platforms for sending emails. These platforms and other email clients track behavior related to those emails, including whether you have received or opened the email, opened an attachment or clicked a link in the email, or forwarded the email. If you do not want us to collect this information from future Trimble marketing emails, you can opt out of receiving Trimble marketing emails using the “Manage Preferences” or “Unsubscribe” link on the bottom of the email you received (either option may apply).
Stored Information and Files
Trimble may use cookies, web beacons or other tracking mechanisms to collect information about how you have used our websites and apps, and our servers may collect similar information when you are logged in to the app or website. Depending on the website or app, we work to collect this information, depending on the website and the app, on an anonymous basis, or it may include references to you. We may also access metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device. This may include, for example, cached image files.
Trimble online advertising
Trimble displays ads to you on our own websites and apps and through third parties’ (i.e. other companies') websites or apps, in various manners.  We collect information such as which ads are displayed, which ads are clicked on, and where the ad was displayed. If you download Trimble content offered on a displayed ad, identifiers relating to you and your computer usage will be collected as a part of that download process.  Certain US residents may have certain opt-out rights with respect to cross-context behavioral advertising and/or targeted advertising; for more information, see Section VII below.
Buttons, tools, and content from other companies
Sometimes our apps and websites link to other companies’ services via buttons, tools, or other content. We collect information about your use of these features. In addition, when you see or interact with these buttons, tools, or content, or view a Trimble web page or app containing them, information from your browser may automatically be sent to the other company. We encourage you to read that company’s privacy notice for more information about their privacy practices.
Trimble community pages
Trimble uses third party platforms for creating community sites for Trimble users, where, for example, 3D models can be shared. To become a member and receive access to a community site, you will be asked to set up a user account and to provide personal information as a part of a registration process.
Trimble social community
Trimble participates in social community sites and provides our information there (for example, our LinkedIn pages).
You may also be able to sign-in to a Trimble app or website using a social networking account, such as a Google account. When you use these sign-on features, we may collect information on you from the relevant social vendor for providing account access, including a unique identifier, email, first and last name.
Trimble places paid ads on social sites like LinkedIn or Facebook for engaging marketing thought leadership. Related content may also be offered. We require personal information as a part of webform submissions to provide access for downloading those materials.
Trimble for education
Trimble often offers a free version of some of its software to students as a part of a higher-education curriculum. In those instances, Trimble takes every precaution to protect the privacy of students with regards to personal data. At a minimum Trimble:
Confirms the student downloading software is 14 years of age or older;
Verifies all student data collected is used for the sole purpose of software registration and is not used for marketing purposes;
Uses third party education sites like G Suite for schools to protect the privacy of students (please refer to G Suite for their privacy policy with regards to students)
III. For what Purposes do we use this information?
Trimble uses the information we collect about you (including Usage Information) in a number of ways, such as:
Providing you with our apps and websites for which you have registered or which you have purchased or licensed, as well as any products, software, services, support, or information you have requested, purchased or licensed from us;
Performing our obligations to our clients which have purchased or licensed products, software and/or services used by you;
To deliver you services, products, and support as necessary to perform the contract governing your use of our applications or to communicate with you;
Improving our products, software, services, websites and apps and their user experience by analyzing their use to deliver a more personalized experience;
Generating de-identified and/or anonymized information about you or other users, and information that does not identify any individual or device, which may be used by us, our affiliates, and others without restriction;
Diagnosing problems in our products, software, services, apps and websites and notifying you of fixes;
Tailoring a website, app, or Trimble ad to your likely interests;
Providing you with functionality and/or marketing specific to your location;
Communicating with you with regards to your business relationship with us, for example, when a contract is established or performed, or notifying you when subscriptions expire;
Keeping you informed about our company, our product updates, new app releases, special offers, and similar information;
Conducting market research about our customers, their interests, and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;
Using your personal and behavioral data, to improve user experience of our products, software, services, websites and apps and to identify other persons that respond similarly;
Implementing cybersecurity initiatives, including reducing fraud, software and IP piracy, and protecting the confidentiality of your information;
As further described in supplemental privacy notices provided by us.
Monitoring usage and interaction statistics of our products, software, services, websites or apps, and/or to perform data analytics in order to assess and enhance our products, software, services, websites and/or apps; and
Monitoring and/or process automatic crash reporting or other technical issues.
IV. On what basis does Trimble collect and process this information?
For personal information collected about you in the EU, our basis for processing is the following:
In order to communicate adequately with you and to respond to your requests, we need to process information about you and therefore have a legitimate interest in processing this information.
In order to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners, and to process purchases and downloads of our products and services, we need to process information about you as necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you.
We process personal information for marketing and sales activities based on your consent where so indicated on our sites at the time your personal information was collected, or further to our legitimate interest to market and promote our products and services.
We rely on our legitimate interest to analyze, develop, improve and optimize our sites, products and services, and to maintain the security of our sites, networks and systems.
In order to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, or to process an opt-out request.
V. Data Transfers
A. Data Access
Trimble relies on other companies for a variety of reasons. We work with third party service providers, such as specialist companies in the area of processing credit card payments, providing software solutions, providing hosting services, or supporting our business processes. Some of these third party providers have access to your personal information in order to provide services to you on our behalf, in order to help us manage or improve our products and services, and/or in order to provide you with a satisfactory user experience. Under our contracts with these service providers, they are not permitted to use your information for their own purposes (but may be permitted to use and disclose anonymized and de-identified information provided you are not identified as the source of the information).
Trimble may also share your personal information:
With our affiliates (i.e. other companies of the Trimble group of companies) for the same purposes described in this privacy notice;
With third party providers (i.e. contractors or agencies) hired to deliver Trimble marketing programs on behalf of Trimble;
With our resellers or other authorized sales partners for the purpose of following up on your requests or marketing communications;
In legal proceedings in which we are a party or a third party, in compliance with lawful requests;
When we have a good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to protect ourselves against fraud, for reasons of cyber defense, or otherwise protect the property and safety of Trimble, our affiliates, our customers and users;
If a company buys us or merges with us or we sell a part of our business and transfer customer information as part of this business: and
When you agree to the sharing.
B. Does Trimble transfer my personal information across national borders?
We may transfer your personal information across national borders to other countries in compliance with applicable laws.
If you reside within the European Economic Area your relationship is with Trimble Europe BV. When Trimble Europe BV transfers your personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom or Switzerland to a non-EEA country, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, and your consent.
We also receive some data in reliance on other compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
If the content or data that you store on or through Trimble software, services, apps or websites contains the personal information of individuals from the EEA, you agree that you have the legal authority to transfer the personal information to Trimble, including the transfer to countries such as the United States where the privacy protections and rights of authorities to access personal data may not be equivalent to those in the EEA.
The information above applies to Trimble users that have agreed to the Trimble Privacy Notice. More information is available for our business customers that want to learn more about European data transfers.
C. Is my personal information displayed anywhere on Trimble’s websites or applications?
There are places within Trimble’s websites and apps that allow you to upload or otherwise share content, models, comments, and to communicate with others. Sometimes you can limit who can see your contributions, but some places can be seen by other users of the app or website. Before sharing, make sure you understand with whom you are sharing your information. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and apps, your email address, user name, or name may be included and displayed with your message.
To remove content you have shared on our websites and apps, please use the same app or website feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact the
Trimble Office of Data Protection
.
VI. Data Retention, Storage and Security
A. Retention periods
Your personal data will be retained as long as necessary to provide you with the services requested. When we no longer need to use your personal data to comply with contractual or statutory obligations, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it, except as required under applicable legal or regulatory obligations, e.g. statutory retention periods which can result from tax requirements and other compliance requirements and usually contain retention periods up to 10 years, or if we need it to preserve evidence within the statutes of limitation, which is usually up to 7 years.
B. Is my personal information secure?
We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information. However, despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% effective and Trimble cannot ensure or warrant the security of your personal information.
We restrict access to your personal information to our authorized employees, agents, and/or third party providers as necessary to fulfill our legal and business obligations and to provide you with our products, software, websites, services and apps.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) user log-in credentials (i.e. a user ID and password) for access to certain parts of our services or apps, you are responsible for keeping these user account credentials confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.  You are solely liable for the protection of user account credentials and for all use of your user account credentials.
Please note that we do not have any control over or responsibility for information or communications you share through our products, software, services, websites or apps, including for any third party websites accessed or linked through them.
C. Where does Trimble store my personal information?
Your personal information and files are stored on Trimble servers and the servers of our third party providers we hire to provide services to us. Your personal information may be transferred across national borders because we have servers located worldwide, and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world.
VII. What Rights and Choices do I have for my personal information? May I close my account with Trimble?
We strive to provide you with choices regarding your personal information. This section describes mechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of your personal information.
A. US Residents’ Privacy Rights and Choices (including under the California Consumer Privacy Act)
Subject to certain limitations, residents of California and certain other US states have rights relating to their personal information as further explained below and on the

B. Global Privacy Controls and “Do Not Track” Signals
Certain Internet browsers and browser extensions support the ability to transmit Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signals. If your browser is configured to send a GPC signal, our website will process that signal and respond by automatically opting you out of any tracking cookies that constitute a “sale” or “sharing” where required by applicable privacy law. GPC signals apply only to your device and Internet browser; if you visit our website from a different device or browser, you will need to reset your GPC settings. For more information about Global Privacy Controls and to learn how to implement it on your browser, please visit
globalprivacycontrol.org
.
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals in Internet browsers. Given a lack of support and adoption, Trimble does not respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, please visit
allaboutdnt.com
.
C. Certain Other Statutory Rights

SketchUp, Trimble, and Your Privacy
As part of Trimble, we are dedicated to keeping your data private and secure. We are also committed to transparency, so we want you to understand the information we may collect from you and why we collect it. The following is a supplement to
Trimble’s privacy commitment
.
The information we collect falls into three categories:
Purchase Information
When you purchase or use one of our free products, we collect basic information provided by you to ensure a record of your purchase and entitlements.
Usage Information
We capture information that helps us understand your experience with SketchUp, so that we can offer you more helpful content to help you get better at the software you're working with. We do use some of this information to serve you applicable content through digital advertising, email, and web properties.
Profile Information
We store information you provide to us to maintain a profile associated with your Trimble account. We use this information to communicate with you, and we never share it with third parties unless you explicitly ask us to, helpful content to help you get better at the software you're working with, and you will always have the ability to update, remove, or add information as desired.
You can always manage your
SketchUp privacy preferences
, and below you’ll find a more detailed look at how our products and services utilize your data.
SketchUp Pro
What we collect
SketchUp Pro validates the software license at the time of installation, and collects activation details when the product starts up. The activation details provide anonymized information regarding the environment the application is running in. Specifically, we capture the following:
Globally unique user ID - Completely anonymous
License state - Trial vs Purchased
Basic product information such as version, operating environment, language, and OpenGL version
Network versions of SketchUp Pro also collect information to make sure that the software is used in compliance with the number of licenses purchased. If, for example, a user purchased a network license with 200 seats, we will count how many seats are currently being used and will allow 200 clients to runs concurrently.
SketchUp Pro uses third-party software to collect error and crash information. The collection and submission of data is voluntary and you will be asked whether or not you would like to submit the information at the time of the crash.
SketchUp Pro relies on Trimble ID for authentication and does not store any user information within the product. Trimble ID collects your first and last name, and email address. This information is required to utilize any products which require authentication (sign in).
How we use that information
The metrics are anonymous and we use the data to validate software use and prevent piracy. We also use them to understand product usage and to improve the product’s performance.
How to access, update, and protect information
You can access your license information from the SketchUp menu bar. Updates to licenses must be made through the
help of a customer service representative
in order to protect the validity of the license. You may also review your license through our
license manager
.
You can find supplemental product specific terms in the
SketchUp Pro end user license agreement
.

SketchUp for Schools
This SketchUp for Schools Privacy Notice for Children (“Children’s Privacy Notice”) supplements the
Trimble Privacy Notice
by providing additional information about how we process the personal information of children under the age of 13 and student users of SketchUp for Schools at a K-12 educational institution (collectively “children”).
This Children’s Privacy Notice sets forth:
The categories of children’s personal information (“CPI”) that we receive.
How we use the CPI we receive.
Our practices for disclosing CPI.
Most Trimble websites, products and services (“applications”) are primarily designed for adults. We refer to applications designed for adults as “general audience applications.” We do not knowingly collect personal data from children in connection with general audience applications. Certain Trimble applications are appropriate for and are intended for use by children. We refer to these applications as “children’s applications.” At this time, SketchUp for Schools is Trimble’s only children’s application.
Where there is a conflict between this Children’s Privacy Notice and the Trimble Privacy Notice, this Children’s Privacy Notice sets the standard for how we treat CPI, consistent with applicable law.
If we discover that we have processed CPI in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, we will promptly delete the data or bring that processing into compliance with applicable law, such as by obtaining appropriate permission for that processing.
We only access as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to use the children’s applications. We do not condition a student’s participation on the disclosure of more CPI than is reasonably necessary and we do not store any CPI.
What we access
Access to the children’s applications is only available through an integration with either Google for Education or Microsoft for Education (each a “Login/Storage Provider”). A K-12 educational institution (“Educational Institution”) that wants its students to use the children’s applications must have a valid account with the Login/Storage Provider (“Service Account”). Likewise, each of the Educational Institution’s students and other permitted users (i.e. administrators) must have a valid Service Account to access the children’s applications.
Students will log in through their Service Account and SketchUp may access and use the child’s first name, last name, email, Login/Storage Provider username and profile picture, which CPI is hosted by the Login/Storage Provider and provided to SketchUp via the integration with the Login/Storage Providers. We do not store any CPI nor transmit any CPI to third parties. For more information, please visit the
SketchUp for Schools Offering Terms
.
We also use technology to automatically collect information from our users, including children, when they access and navigate through the children’s application and use certain of its features. The usage information we collect through these technologies may include information about actions that users take, where users are geographically located, and the devices and operating systems used (“Usage Data”). The Usage Data is anonymized and not able to be linked to an individual.
How we use that information
We use the CPI specified herein to:
Perform account authentication; and
Provide access to and functionality within the children’s application.
We use the Usage Data we collect automatically through technology to improve our children’s applications, perform analytics and understand product usage and performance. We may disclose Usage Data to third parties.
We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer any CPI to third parties.
How to access, update, and protect information
We understand that the security of your data is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect user data. In addition, SketchUp for Schools does not store any CPI. Data requests, including requests for access, deletion, or correction, must be submitted to
Google for Education
or
Microsoft Education
, as applicable.

What we collect
In order to download SketchUp models on mobile devices, headsets, and other compatible hardware, SketchUp Viewer allows users to sign in to 3D Warehouse, Trimble Connect, Dropbox, the iOS Files App, and/or other applications.

SketchUp Viewer collects usage information, such as user activity, performance metrics data, and log information, which includes IP addresses, device IDs, device type, error and crash information.
ARCore
ARCore is Android's SDK for Augmented Reality which allows you to view your models in AR in SketchUp Viewer. For further information about ARCore privacy practices, please read its
privacy policy
.
How we use that information
The metrics are anonymous and we use them to understand product usage and to improve the product’s performance.
Personal information stored in the SketchUp Viewer for Quest application are used to link the user’s Meta or Oculus account with their Trimble ID, and/or enable platform-specific features.

What we collect
The Sefaira web application is the website that runs the performance analysis of your model. Users are required to login in order to use the application. A user profile is created for you when you are added to a Sefaira account as a trial user and/or by your account administrator. We capture basic information about you such as your first name, last name, email, and password. You have the ability to opt-in to notifications through your profile. Your profile information is stored within the Sefaira application and is never shared with third parties.
In addition to your profile information, Sefaira collects usage information, such as projects you own or have access to, user events (e.g. the uploading of models, number of analysis run by users, performance metrics data, and log information, which includes IP addresses, and browser type).
How we use that information
The information allows us to understand the usage of the product, and helps to guide the development of new functionality. It also enables us to help you use the product better. Your profile information is never shared with third parties.
