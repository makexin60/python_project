(iii) A cookie is a text file placed on the hard disk of your computer by a Web page server. Please rest assured that the Cookies cannot be used to run programs or bring viruses to your device.

3.WE MAY SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
Our Company is not in the business of selling your Personal Data. Maintaining the privacy of your Personal Data is a vital part of our relationship with you and an important aspect of the Services that we provide. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
Business Transfers. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets, including Personal Data. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
Agents, Consultants, and Third Parties. The Company, like many businesses, sometimes contracts other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, customer service and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. Additionally, we reserve the right to use third party analytics service providers and advertising partners to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Services, including details as described in this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, we partner with third parties to provide certain support services to our users. We try to limit how these third parties can use the information they gather from you or that we provide. The processing and storage of any and all information you may provide to any of such third parties, including information they may collect from you, is not governed by this Privacy Policy. You will need to review the Privacy and Cookie Policy of such third party on their websites and accept separately if necessary.
Legal Requirements. The Company may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
4.HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR CONTENT
We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and in each case in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in respect of permitted or required retention periods and limitation periods relevant to legal action. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations.
If you wish to close your registered profile or delete your personal information you have provided to us, please follow relevant instructions in your account or contact us by email at
app@lovense.com
.
* Please be noted that any Content that you send to the recipient as aforementioned does not fall within the scope of personal information which we will collect under Article 1 of the Privacy Policy. The Company hereby disclaims any obligation or liability for acquisition, storage and use of the Content by any third party, including the recipient, to whom the Content is sent by the User.
5.CHILDREN SHOULD NOT SUBMIT PERSONAL DATA
The Company does not knowingly collect Personal Data from individuals under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not use the Services and do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children under the age of 18 never to provide Personal Data to the Services. If you have reason to believe that someone under the age of 18 has provided Personal Data to the Company through the Services, please contact us at
support@service.lovense.com
, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
6. HOW WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION AND CONTENT
The Company takes commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. The Company uses security measures for any personal and account data that we store (emails, phone numbers, etc.). Account-identifiable or user-identifiable data collected through the Services may be encrypted and stored on our internal databases. The Company will not sell or transfer account-identifiable data to third parties. Any accessible data associated with your account or your profile can be retrieved only if you provide us with your account identifier. Please be reminded, however, that no internet or email transmission or data storage is ever fully secure or error free and that information on the Services may be accessed, disclosed or altered. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Company via the Internet.
Please note that all payments for products and services are processed by third-parties. The Company makes good-faith efforts to use third-party companies which employ proper protections for private information. However, we have no control over said companies; therefore, the Company exclusively disclaims any obligation or liability for said third-parties' processes and security measures.

9. SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This supplemental privacy policy shall apply only to residents of California, according to the regulation of CCPA, and may be subject to change. The general privacy policy shall continue to apply to the extent that it applies to you as a resident of California. Any term used in this supplemental privacy policy shall have the same meaning as in the general privacy policy.
The CCPA requires disclosure of the categories of personal information collected over the past 12 months. While this information is provided in greater detail above, the categories of personal information that we have collected, as described by the CCPA, are:
Identifiers, including name, email address, IP address, and an ID or number  assigned to your account.
Other individual records such as phone number, billing address, or credit or debit card information. This category includes personal information protected under pre-existing California law and overlaps with other categories listed here.
Demographics, such as your age or gender, or, where you have provided such information voluntarily. This category includes data that may qualify as protected classifications under other California or federal laws.
Commercial information, including purchases and engagement with our services.
Internet activity, including your interactions with our services.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 entitles California customers to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. California customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us, in writing by email at
app@lovense.com
