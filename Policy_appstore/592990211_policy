App History
Its development would begin in December 2021. The app would be released on the App Store on January 24, 2013.
Early Development
On December 6, 2012 Bryce Cogswell
announced
in his diary that he will be working on a native Cocoa based editor mainly for desktop. (But then moved to only iOS.)
In the early stages of the apps development when it was in beta the app would be called OSMiOS but when it would be released on the App Store Bryce ultimately changed the name to
Go Map!!
Go Map!!
would have a proprietary license in its early years and would be coded in Objective-C and Cocoa. It would also be only available only on the iPhone and iPad.
Please read this
diary
by Cogswell for a detailed background on the app.
Recent Years
On October 3, 2021 Bryce Cogswell would publish a diary on the change from the apps proprietary license to ISC and being open source on version 1.6 allowing its users to contribute to the app.
[1]
On version 2.0.7
Go Map!!
would go under a huge change on its look in which what it looks like today.
[2]
Later on
Go Map!!
would start moving away from objective-c to swift in order to be “faster, easier to understand, easier to debug, and [to be] in line with Apple’s direction for modern apps.”
[3]
On the 16th of October in 2021 Bryceco would release the app on Mac. (With this, mouse and keyboard support on iPad.)
