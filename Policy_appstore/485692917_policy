"What about information that’s provided about other people?"
If you are a beneficiary or other third party with an interest in the policy, we get personal information from the person who took out the policy (for example, your partner).
In some circumstances we collect information about children. For example, we may need to collect their information to find out if they are beneficiaries of a policy.

Your rights
section.
id
"What are the lawful bases for processing my personal information?"
We will only collect, use and share your information if we have a valid legal reason, known as a legal basis, as set out in data protection law. The main legal bases for using your information are as follows.
1.
Contract
– the processing is necessary for a contract we have with you to provide a product or service to you, or because you have asked us to take specific steps before entering into a contract with us.
2.
Legal obligation
– the processing is necessary for us to keep to the law, such as needing proof of identity to meet our fraud and anti-money laundering duties.
3.
Legitimate interests
– the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or those of a third party.
Our legitimate interests may include, but are not limited to:
•    making you aware of the options that will help you get the best outcome from your product or investment, and
•    carrying out research so we can better understand your needs and send you relevant communications about the products and services you have with us. (You can opt out of these types of communications by emailing
service_gp@standardlife.com
or using the details provided in the
How to contact us
section of this Privacy Notice.)
It is also in your legitimate interests to process your personal data to develop new products and services.
An example of processing your personal information to meet the interests of a third party is sharing information with your employer's adviser in connection with your workplace pension scheme.
When we process personal information for legitimate business interests, we put safeguards in place. The safeguards make sure your privacy is protected and that our legitimate interests do not override your interests or your data protection rights.
4.
Consent
– you have given us permission to process your personal information for a specific purpose, such as to send you information about products and services we believe may be of interest to and benefit you.
For example, we’ll need to get your permission to process your medical information or pass your details to a third party who provides a service we don’t. you have the right to withdraw your permission at any time.
In some limited cases we may need to process your personal information without getting your permission, if this is in the public interest and allowed under data protection law. If this is the case, we will take necessary steps to make sure your rights and freedoms are protected.
If we ask for your permission to process your personal information, and you agree, you can withdraw your permission at any time by emailing
service_gp@standardlife.com
or using the details provided in the
How to contact us
section of this Privacy Notice. Please read section 18,
Your rights
, for more details.
3. Profiling and automated decision making
How we keep in touch with you and provide marketing communications
We want to help you get the most out of your savings.  A big part of the service we provide is sharing our expertise with you. We do this by providing updates and information to help you along the way. Our communications play an important part in this, helping you to save and manage your money.
Certain communications we send you, such as your annual statement, are important for you to understand your plan. We must send these to you to meet a legal obligation or regulatory requirement.  You can’t opt out of these communications.
Some communications are important as they give you essential information at the best time to help you save and manage your money.  You can opt out of these communications.
Other communications are designed to gather your feedback to help us improve the products and services we offer.  This could involve taking part in surveys or questionnaires, perhaps online, on the phone or in person. You can opt out of these communications.
We also provide marketing communications about offers, services and additional products that can help you achieve your financial goals. You can opt out of these communications.
Other marketing communications give you access to products, services and offers from our trusted partners and our parent company, the Phoenix Group. We will never share your details with external companies for them to market their own products and services direct to you. You can opt out of these communications.
We may provide marketing communications by post, and by phone, text message and email if we have your permission.
You’re in control of how we contact you and the communications you receive. You can manage your communication preferences through your online account or by calling our Customer Services team. Take a look at the
How to contact us
section for more details.

"What do you do with customer profiling?"
The way we process your personal information may involve profiling. This means that we may process your personal information using software that can evaluate your personal circumstances and other factors to predict risks or outcomes. We may also use profiling, or other automated methods, to make decisions about you.
We use profiling to help us develop offers, products and services in order to provide you with the best customer experience. We may also use profiling to see how you use and interact with our website and online tools. This helps us to improve our services to you.
From time to time we use your information, sometimes combined with information from third parties, to place you in groups with similar customers. This combined information is then used to:
monitor and improve the products and services we offer
help prevent crime
decide if our customers might be displaying characteristics that show they may need additional support from us, and
make sure information is accurate and of a high quality
An example of customers who are grouped together are those nearing retirement, where we use profiling of that group to provide information about their retirement options.
Before we use any information from profiling, we carry out checks to make sure there are no legal restrictions on using that information. We also consider whether using the information might cause outcomes that are unfair.
Where possible we remove details you could be identified from, such as your name, and replace these with anonymous details. We do this to protect your information.
If you don't want us to use your personal information for profiling, please contact our Customer Services team using the details in the
How to contact us
section of this Privacy Notice. If you do not want us to use your personal information for profiling, this may mean that we will not be able to provide you with our products or services.
id
"What do you do with marketing profiles?"
We use automated processes to assess certain things about you in order to make predictions such as customer traits and behaviours. These predictions are called marketing profiles and they help us provide more personalised advertising for our products and services. To create marketing profiles we use information such as:
details of your policy
information on your behaviours, such as how you use our website
your age, and
your contact details.
We would use your marketing profile to decide the most relevant products, services, offers or benefits to offer you and the best time and way to offer them. For example, we may use marketing profiles to see if customers prefer to use our website to find out about products and services. If they do, we contact customers to let them know about any online services we are offering. We may also share your marketing profile with service providers who can show advertisements to you about our products and services on social media platforms.
We may use your email address and phone number to build a profile of the type of customers we want to reach. We may share this information with social media and digital companies.
We may use a third party’s services and information to create marketing profiles.
If you don’t want us to use your information to create marketing profiles, please contact our Customer Services team using the details in the
How to contact us
section.
id
When we use automated decision-making
We sometimes use automated decision-making, where decisions are made by a computer system without any person involved. This process uses information that you have given us and that is in records we hold about you, and information we get from third parties. An example of automated decision-making is where an automated process uses information on the value of your annuity to decide the terms and price of a policy.
If we make an automated decision, you have the right to:
receive an explanation about the logic behind the decision
challenge the decision, and
ask for a person to be involved in making the decision.
For more information about this right and how to exercise it, please see the
Your rights
section.
We make certain decisions based just on automated processing of your personal information. Examples of when we make decisions based just on automated processing are as follows.
We carry out credit reference checks to decide if you are likely to be able to meet your commitments in any contract you have with us. If you don’t meet the standards required by the check, we will not be able to enter into a contract with you.
In order to meet our obligations to prevent fraud and money laundering, we analyse patterns of transactions and claims to decide if any transaction or claim may be fraudulent. We may block transactions or reject claims if they’re considered suspicious, and we may be required to report the matter to the relevant authorities.
Please contact us if you would like more information about these activities.
4. Who we share your information with
Whenever we share your personal information, we do this in line with data protection laws that are in place to keep your information safe and secure. The table below shows who we may share your personal information with. We will not share your personal information with any of these third parties until we have carried out checks on those parties.

The Standard Life website uses a Facebook Pixel, which is a cookie that collects information about your activity on our website, if you accepted ‘targeting cookies’ when visiting our website.
Information collected by the Facebook Pixel may be used to connect your activity on our website, such as pages viewed and transactions made, to our Facebook advertising account. It then makes a match to people who use Facebook.

Facebook joint data controller
Facebook expects us to tell visitors to our website that Facebook Ireland is a ‘joint data controller’ with us when processing information collected by the Facebook Pixel or sent to Facebook by us. Once Facebook receives this information it acts as an independent data controller. How Facebook Ireland processes personal information collected by the Facebook Pixel, including the legal basis and how to exercise your rights, is explained in Facebook Ireland’s data policy at
www.facebook.com/about/privacy
.
We and Facebook Ireland have entered into an arrangement to decide our and their responsibilities for meeting the obligations under data protection law, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The arrangement is in connection with the joint processing of personal information through the Facebook Pixel. We are responsible for providing information on how personal information is processed through the pixel.

Email pixels
When we send you an email to tell you about the products and services we offer, we use an email pixel. This collects information about how you respond to the email. It tells us when you opened the email, how many times you opened the email and whether you clicked on any of the links in it. This information helps us to better understand the effect of our emails and how useful you find the content about our products and services.
Depending on the device you use to check emails from us, you may be able to disable the email pixel. You will need to check this with your device manufacturer.
6. Where your information is processed
We operate mainly in the UK and Ireland.  Sometimes the information we collect from you may be accessed from, transferred to or stored outside the UK and Ireland (for example, in India or the United States, where some of our servicing partners are based).
If your information is being processed outside the UK or Ireland, we take extra steps to make sure your information is protected to at least an equivalent level of protection as would be applied in the UK or Ireland. For example, we put in place legal agreements with our suppliers and do regular checks to make sure they are keeping to the requirements of those agreements.
id
Information transferred to third parties outside the UK and EEA
When we transfer information to a third party outside the UK and EEA, we either put in place data transfer agreements that are based on approved standard clauses or rely on other appropriate safeguards and methods to protect the information. However, this is not necessary if the third party is in a country where the European Commission and the ICO consider data protection laws to be adequate.

Privacy Notices
How to keep your data safe
While we do everything in our power to keep your data secure, there are also some simple steps you can take to protect yourself online.
Passwords
Social media
Scams
Online reputation
Digital footprint
Strong passwords
Setting a strong password for each of your online accounts is the most important thing you can do to protect your information. Below are some tips for creating a strong password:
Don't use the same password for all your accounts. Although this makes it easier to remember your password, it also puts all of your accounts at risk if a website is breached.
Create a strong password that is easy for you to remember. Some secure password managers can suggest strong passwords for you to use.
Avoid passwords that can be easily guessed such as a family member's name or birthday.
Avoid passwords that could be guessed from your social media. Any information you post online is made public and available for hackers.
Avoid writing down passwords. If you find it difficult to remember your passwords, you may want to use a secure password manager to store your passwords.
Where possible, try to set up two factor authentication on your online accounts. Once you've logged in using your username and password, two factor authentication is an additional step that requires you to further verify your identity. Common forms of two factor authentication include entering a code you receive by text or answering a security question.
Social media tips
Social media is a great way for us to connect with others, but it's important to remember that any information you put on social media is public and could be accessed by people with malicious intent.
Avoid posting any information on social media that may be used to verify your identity such as your full date of birth address, drivers licence, passport or credit card details. It's also best not to share your location on social media, particularly if you're confirming you will be away from home for an extended period of time. Beware that when you post photos your location is often tagged, and this metadata can often be accessed on the social media platform
You should regularly check the data privacy settings on social media platforms as they are updated regularly.
There is also an increasing number of scams appearing across social media channels. Some common tips for avoiding scams include questioning whether an offer looks too good to be true, inspecting links and landing pages for misspellings and contact the company/person separately if you are in any doubt.
Spotting scams
Unfortunately scams now come in many forms and it's important to stay alert when you're online. Social media scams, phishing emails and SMiShing texts are just a few scam variations.
For phishing and SMiShing scams, fraudsters will often pose as a legitimate person or company to attempt to trick you into providing personal details. To spot one of these messages, consider the following:
Were you expecting to receive it?
Inspect who the message has come from, checking for misspellings
Be especially wary of messages asking for money or personal data.
If in doubt, do not click on any links or open any attachments. To verify whether the message is legitimate, contact the company separately. Do not reply to the message or use contact details contained in the body of the message.
For more information on helping you stay safe online, view our
Digital Essentials guides
. Our Phoenix Life Customer Centre also holds more information on
online security
and protecting yourself from
fraud and scams
.
Managing your online reputation
Any information you enter on social networking websites, accounts, or any other website could potentially be up for grabs in the event of a data breach. In general, the information you put online contributes to your online reputation, which can impact your chances of securing employment, getting into your college of choice, and create many problems if the information is unfavourable.
Monitoring your online reputation can also help you pick up on sensitive information that shouldn't be publicly available so you can take action to have it removed. Search all variations of your name, avoiding searching for personal identification numbers (such as your driver's licence number or National Insurance number), and asking website owners to remove this information if you find it published. You should also check sites you frequently visit, as well as social networking websites, so that you can clean up your profiles if necessary.
Managing your digital footprint
Just like evaluating your online reputation, taking stock of your digital footprint involves investigating your online presence, including locating old accounts that you no longer use. With your digital information scattered everywhere over the course of a lifetime, it’s important to think about what valuable information you have where. For example, how many web sites are storing your credit card information? How many have up-to-date card numbers and expiration dates? Where do you have important documents, files and videos across the web?
You can start by making a list and noting the types of sensitive data associated with each site. If there are sites you no longer use, you might want to consider deleting your account profiles.

How to keep your data safe
While we do everything in our power to keep your data secure, there are also some simple steps you can take to protect yourself online.
Passwords
Social media
Scams
Online reputation
Digital footprint
Strong passwords
Setting a strong password for each of your online accounts is the most important thing you can do to protect your information. Below are some tips for creating a strong password:
Don't use the same password for all your accounts. Although this makes it easier to remember your password, it also puts all of your accounts at risk if a website is breached.
Create a strong password that is easy for you to remember. Some secure password managers can suggest strong passwords for you to use.
Avoid passwords that can be easily guessed such as a family member's name or birthday.
Avoid passwords that could be guessed from your social media. Any information you post online is made public and available for hackers.
Avoid writing down passwords. If you find it difficult to remember your passwords, you may want to use a secure password manager to store your passwords.
Where possible, try to set up two factor authentication on your online accounts. Once you've logged in using your username and password, two factor authentication is an additional step that requires you to further verify your identity. Common forms of two factor authentication include entering a code you receive by text or answering a security question.
Social media tips
Social media is a great way for us to connect with others, but it's important to remember that any information you put on social media is public and could be accessed by people with malicious intent.
Avoid posting any information on social media that may be used to verify your identity such as your full date of birth address, drivers licence, passport or credit card details. It's also best not to share your location on social media, particularly if you're confirming you will be away from home for an extended period of time. Beware that when you post photos your location is often tagged, and this metadata can often be accessed on the social media platform
You should regularly check the data privacy settings on social media platforms as they are updated regularly.
There is also an increasing number of scams appearing across social media channels. Some common tips for avoiding scams include questioning whether an offer looks too good to be true, inspecting links and landing pages for misspellings and contact the company/person separately if you are in any doubt.
Spotting scams
Unfortunately scams now come in many forms and it's important to stay alert when you're online. Social media scams, phishing emails and SMiShing texts are just a few scam variations.
For phishing and SMiShing scams, fraudsters will often pose as a legitimate person or company to attempt to trick you into providing personal details. To spot one of these messages, consider the following:
Were you expecting to receive it?
Inspect who the message has come from, checking for misspellings
Be especially wary of messages asking for money or personal data.
If in doubt, do not click on any links or open any attachments. To verify whether the message is legitimate, contact the company separately. Do not reply to the message or use contact details contained in the body of the message.

online security

Managing your online reputation
Any information you enter on social networking websites, accounts, or any other website could potentially be up for grabs in the event of a data breach. In general, the information you put online contributes to your online reputation, which can impact your chances of securing employment, getting into your college of choice, and create many problems if the information is unfavourable.
Monitoring your online reputation can also help you pick up on sensitive information that shouldn't be publicly available so you can take action to have it removed. Search all variations of your name, avoiding searching for personal identification numbers (such as your driver's licence number or National Insurance number), and asking website owners to remove this information if you find it published. You should also check sites you frequently visit, as well as social networking websites, so that you can clean up your profiles if necessary.
