Linkus is used with Yeastar P-Series PBX System, Yeastar Cloud PBX, Yeastar S-Series VoIP PBX or Yeastar K2 IP-PBX (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Yeastar PBX Systems”), which provides communication and collaboration services for users. Linkus processes the personal data of the individuals who participate in these communications. If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information we collect
Through your usage of Linkus, Yeastar processes different kinds of information. Some of it is personally identifiable and some are non-identifying or aggregated. Here are the types of information we collect or receive:
Personal Information – This includes all the information associated with your Linkus Extension. It includes names and full contact details for the individual or business that created the account.  This is vital for PBX administrative purposes and basic call functions.
Extension Information — When you use the password reset feature, we will collect your extension number, email, device SN/domain, or login address through the password reset process. This information is collected to help you recover your password.
Sensor Usage – During Linkus login via QR code, your device’s acceleration sensor is used for improved photo effects. During calls, the distance sensor is used to enable on-ear mode. When you access the privacy policy, help and feedback, free trial, or legal terms, we utilize your gyroscope sensor to automatically adjust the display orientation. When you use the video call function, we will also access your magnetic field sensor, proximity sensor, accelerometer, and ambient light sensor during video calls in order to enable automatic screen off and screen rotation for landscape or portrait orientation.
Camera Permission and WiFi Signal Strength — When you use the video call function, we will provide you with the corresponding features after obtaining your consent to access the microphone and camera permissions. In order to optimize the audio and video quality when your WiFi connection is unstable, we may collect information about the strength of your WiFi signal.

The system also supports uploading custom prompt to notify both parties that the call is being recorded. What’s more, calling parties can stop/interrupt a recorded call to protect personal data from being stored

If we unintentionally collect personal information of a child without verified parental consent, we will promptly delete it.
Sharing and Disclosure
There are times when communications and related content and other user information may be shared by Yeastar. With consent, to comply with legal process, or to protect Yeastar and our users.

If we receive law enforcement or other third party requests for information we will provide prior notice to the subject of the request where we are legally permitted to do so.
We might use third-party SDK services to implement Linkus services such as push notification and instant messaging for you. When you are using Linkus, the third-party SDK services might collect your personal information to make the services functions, and Yeastar will conduct security protections to ensure such processing of the data will remain secure and comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
Security
Yeastar takes reasonable steps to protect the information you provide to us as part of your use of the Yeastar service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. When you enter sensitive information (such as sign-in credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and encrypt all data at rest. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
If you need to obtain a copy of your personal information collected by us, you can contact us at any time. We will provide you with a copy of your personal information, upon your request and to the extent permitted by law and technological feasibility.
To ensure security, we may verify your identity before processing your request. Reasonable requests are generally free of charge, unless they are repetitive or exceed reasonable limits. We reserve the right to refuse unfounded requests, those requiring excessive technical efforts or posing risks to others’ rights and interests, and highly impractical requests. We cannot respond to requests related to legal obligations, national security, public safety, public health, significant public interests, criminal matters, subjective malicious intent or rights abuse, vital interests without consent, requests causing serious harm to rights and interests, and those involving trade secrets.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Yeastar may change this policy from time to time. If you continue to use Yeastar after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are material, we may provide more prominent notice or seek your consent to the new policy.
