Purpose and legal basis for processing your data
The use of our website and apps for informational purposes is designed in such a way that as little data as possible is collected from you and is usually possible without providing any personal data. This does not apply if personal data is required as part of an order from our online shops, for the creation of a Tonie-Account, for use of
my
tonies (
my.tonies.com
) (hereinafter '
my
tonies'), including orders from the Audio Library; as part of customer care enquiries, as part of a newsletter subscription that you have requested, through our general contact form or for use of our blog or for information about our own similar products and services. As a network-based system with a server (
my
tonies) and client systems (the Tonieboxes and Tonies with audio content), there are also other data exchange processes without which it is impossible to use the system to its full extent. Further information about the general functionality of our system can also be found on our
US website
, our
UK Website
and on our
German website
.
We only ever collect personal data on a voluntary basis where this is possible for the performance of our service. If there exist no legal grounds for such processing, we generally obtain your consent. You can at any time withdraw any consent that you have given. Your data is not disclosed to third parties. Excepted from this are our service partners who require personal data in order to process any orders of yours from our online shop or Audio Library or as part of customer care enquiries (e.g. delivery companies contracted for delivery, financial and payment institutions contracted to process payment, our service partners for customer care enquiries and our technical support). However, in these cases the extent of data that is transferred is limited to the minimum necessary for the relevant service; all personal data is of course also treated as strictly confidential by our service partners and processed in accordance with the GDPR. In the event of a credit check, address and credit history data may be exchanged with a recognised, external company (Schufa or Creditreform), within a legally permitted framework and incorporating the protection of your legitimate interests. However, we do not assume liability for third parties unless such liability is declared separately.
In addition, if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your personal information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, solely as permitted by law and/or contract. We may also disclose any information we store associated with you if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate: to comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process; protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.
If we make adjustments to our business processes and these adjustments have consequences for information obligations pursuant to applicable laws, we will update our Data Protection Policy accordingly and notify you as required under applicable law. Likewise, we will incorporate changes of data protection law and case law and update our Data Protection Policy to reflect them. We recommend that you read our Data Protection Policy regularly for this reason.
Purposes of data processing and legal grounds
We process your personal data in accordance with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).
Data entered into the contact form is processed on the basis of your consent (GDPR Article 6(1)(a)). The legal grounds for processing data that is transferred when sending an email are provided in GDPR Article 6(1)(f). If the email contact is for the purpose of entering into a contract, there are additional legal grounds for processing provided in GDPR Article 6(1)(b).
Your personal data is processed primarily for the performance of our contractual services in our online shops and
my
tonies (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)), that is, as part of the performance of our contracts with our customers and, if relevant, also for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken pursuant to a request for our products and services.
In order to provide our contractual services, we use processors with whom we have concluded a Data Processing Agreement in accordance with GDPR Article 28. If the processors are located outside the EU or EEA and there is no adequacy decision of the European Commission, the processing is permitted under GDPR Article 46 (2) (c), as we have concluded a contract including the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission ("EU Standard Contractual Clauses"), the wording of which is available here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=DE.
If you have given us your consent to the processing of your personal data for specific purposes (e.g. a newsletter subscription), this data is processed based on your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Such withdrawal only takes effect for the future and does not affect the lawfulness of data processed before the time of withdrawal. (GDPR Article 6(1)(a))
If we are subject to a legal obligation that requires us to process personal data, for example to fulfil tax obligations, such processing of personal data is based on the grounds provided in GDPR Article 6(1)(c).
In the context of balancing interests: If we process personal data that is not covered by the above legal bases, the processing may also be necessary to respect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms are not overridden. This is the case, for example, if we use your personal data to inform you about our own similar goods and services, provided that we have informed you of this when collecting the data used for this purpose (such as your e-mail address) and you have not objected to this, or if data is exchanged with a recognized third party company (Schufa or Kreditreform) for the purpose of checking creditworthiness, possibly as part of order processing. (GDPR Article 6 (1) lit. f, § 7 (3) (2) UWG.
The following applies as part of a balancing of interests: if we process personal data that is not included within the aforementioned legal grounds, such processing may also be required if it is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, unless your interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms are overriding. For example, this could be the case if we use your personal data for our own marketing of our products, provided you have not objected to such usage of your data, or if data is exchanged with a recognised external company (Schufa or Creditreform) for a credit check that may form part of an order's fulfilment. (GDPR Article 6(1)(f), German Unfair Competition Act (UWG) Section 7(3))

access
rectification
erasure
restriction of processing (on the relevant provider's website)

data portability (transfer of the household in your account)
To exercise your rights, you may complete this

Data usage in detail
The following explains to you in detail how our systems use your data.
Server log files
The provider of this website automatically gathers and saves information in server log files automatically transferred to us by your browser. This information includes:
browser type/version
operating system used
referrer URL
host name of the accessing computer
time of server request
IP address
request authorisation
We do not match this data with a specific person or merge it with other data sources. However, we do reserve the right to review this data at a later date if we gain knowledge of concrete indications of unlawful use. The data is required to provide the contents of our website correctly. We do not infer details about specific persons when using this general data and information. Rather, this data/information is required to (1) present the content of our website correctly, , including directing you to the correct version of our site for your region (2) optimise the content and advertisement of our website, (3) assure ongoing operability of our IT systems and our website's technology and (4) supply information required for criminal prosecution to prosecution authorities in the event of a cyberattack. This data and information, which is collected anonymously, is therefore analysed by us for statistical purposes and, moreover, with the goal of increasing the protection and security of data in our organisation so that an optimal level of protection for the personal data processed by us can ultimately be assured. The anonymous data in the server log files is stored separately from all personal data provided by the data subject. The stored customer data of yours is not sold.
Data use with Toniebox, Tonies, mytonies and the Tonie-Account
Every Toniebox by default comes with an individual client certificate that it can use for unique authentication with
my
tonies. In addition to this client certificate, there is another Toniebox ID stored in
my
tonies for each Toniebox. This Toniebox ID is also affixed to the bottom of the Toniebox. When setting up the Toniebox for the first time and connecting it to a new Wi-Fi network, you are asked to enter the Toniebox ID for it to be matched with
my
tonies. This serves to ensure that only authorised Tonieboxes can make contact with
my
tonies.
The Toniebox is coupled with a Tonie-Account through the Toniebox ID. All you need to create this account in
my
tonies is a valid email address and a password that you choose. Furthermore, you must provide your Toniebox ID to link your Toniebox with your Tonie-Account. Creating a Tonie-Account is a requirement for using (and also configuring) the Toniebox, using Creative-Tonies and the Audio Library, connecting with other members and using other functions in the Toniebox ecosystem. If a Tonie-Account is deleted after being used to set up the Toniebox, these special functions of
my
tonies will no longer be able to be used. Further information about deleting Tonie-Accounts and the effects of doing so can be found here.
When you use your Toniebox, the following events will cause it try to establish a connection with
my
tonies: initial set-up, powering on, putting on a Tonie unknown to the Toniebox and starting a search for new content. If the connection with
my
tonies is successfully established, the Toniebox sends your individual client certificate, your IP address and a timestamp. When you use Tonies and Tonieboxes, we also receive data about operational events (Tonie put on or removed, including the Tonie's identifier (e.g. Creative-Tonie or Benjamin the Elephant Tonie); volume changes, fast-forwarding and skipping, connecting or disconnecting headphones or connecting or disconnecting the charging station) and the content that is assigned to your Tonie at a particular time. When setting up the Toniebox or adding another WiFi, the available networks and the connected network (SSID) are also transmitted. In doing this, we seek to improve our service and product for you on an ongoing basis. The transferred data described above is generally collected by us on an anonymous basis and stored in server log files so that we can analyse it as necessary. If you contact our customer care and state the Toniebox ID as part of a support enquiry (e.g. because your Tonie has a technical problem or because a Toniebox and/or Tonie is/are lost in transit), the data that has been anonymous up until that stage will potentially be linked with the personal data given by you in relation to the enquiry. The customer care staff will actively let you know about this in such cases. Using data in the manner described here makes it possible for us to process your support enquiry, track down Tonieboxes or Tonies that are lost in transit, resolve problems with Audio Library content and uncover instances of misuse or breach of law and defend ourselves against them. The data that is linked in the described manner is deleted as soon as your support enquiry has been brought to a full conclusion. In cases where there has potentially been a breach of the law, we will store the data until the breach of law has been resolved, or until legal proceedings have concluded if such proceedings are opened, and will only erase it when we no longer need the data for evidence and defence purposes or to comply with retention obligations.
After you have set up a Tonie-Account and linked your Toniebox with this account using the Toniebox ID, we can link your customer data with the aforementioned data and will then be able to customise our newsletter (if you have opted in for it) and other marketing activities to you and your personal interests and thus improve our marketing activities and their benefits on an ongoing basis. If you do not wish for this to occur, you of course have the option to deactivate this at any time from within
your profile on my.tonies.com
.
If you upload audio files for your Creative-Tonies to
my
tonies (through the app or our website), these files will be converted by our server into the required format and then made available for playback on the Creative-Tonies. The data you originally upload will be automatically deleted after seven days. The converted data will be stored in
my
tonies. You can upload new files for the desired Creative-Tonie as often as you like. As soon as the maximum run time of 90 minutes has been reached for each Creative-Tonie, you must delete your old files so that they can be replaced by new ones. We do not save old data, though for technical reasons the converted data will be stored for at least seven days following conversion. We reserve the right to sample uploaded data and check if it potentially violates applicable law (including copyrights, personality rights or competition law), applicable case law and/or common decency. If we find such a violation, we reserve the right to delete your data in
my
tonies and cancel your Tonie-Account.
If you cancel/close your Tonie-Account, your Audio Library content and the files you have uploaded for your Creative-Tonies will be deleted after cancelling. If you cancel your Tonie-Account, your order history and any personal information provided voluntarily or to place orders will also be deleted. It is impossible to transfer this information to another user before cancelling your account.
Data use with app and Toniebox QR code packaging
If you use our 'tonies' app, you require a Tonie-Account and must also log into the app with your email address and password before you can use the app. The apps enable you to record speech and combine it with a selected Creative-Tonie through the app by uploading it from the smartphone or tablet to
my
tonies.
In order for you to be able to use our app and its functions to their full extent, the app must be able to access various functions and data. You must grant the relevant permissions so that we receive this access (representing a declaration of consent under laws such as GDPR Article 6(1)(a)). We only obtain permissions that are actually required for usage in practice. Please be aware that you cannot use the full extent of our app's functionality unless all permissions are provided.
All users must ensure they have the proper consent of any individual they record via the app (or, in the case of a child's voice, the child's parent or legal guardian) when uploading content to the app. Please see the relevant Terms and Conditions/Terms of Use for your territory for more information.
The app uses the following data:
audio recordings, titles uploaded to
my
tonies
customer data for verification
Toniebox name
Push token (for sending push notifications)
The app accesses the following items for specific purposes:
identity/accounts on the device and usage of it
photographs/media/files for transfer as part of the app's defined usage
microphone for recording audio files
network for the display of network connections
stopping the device from entering sleep mode
changing audio settings
Finally, we would also like to point out that every Toniebox package is given a QR code during manufacturing. This primarily serves internal purposes (our ERP system); as a rule, this information is not linked with your Tonie-Account. The contrary only applies if we have sufficient evidence of fraud. In this case, we link the QR code with your Tonie-Account to detect Tonieboxes that have not arrived, which serves to protect us from breaches of the law. We delete the personal data used in this process as soon as the suspicion of fraud proves unsubstantiated and/or the fraud investigation process has been concluded and the data is no longer needed for evidence and legal defence purposes.
We may send you push notifications through our app. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device by activating or deactivating

Under the joint responsibility for the described processing, you may exercise your rights under the GDPR both with Tonies UK Ltd. and with Userlytics.
The legal basis for the data processing activity is your consent, obtained by Userlytics (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR) or your contractual relationship with Userlytics (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.
ii. Participation in surveys via SurveyMonkey
If you have consented to being contacted for marketing purposes, we may ask you to participate in a survey from time to time. The same applies if we contact you for a customer satisfaction survey following your purchase.
We use the service of SurveyMonkey Europe UC, 2 Shelbourne Buildings, Second Floor, Shelbourne Rd, Ballsbridge Dublin 4, Ireland ("SurveyMonkey") for the technical implementation of the survey. Participation in a survey takes place via a link. We collect your data in order to conduct a survey, the results of which are used to determine our customers' needs and product satisfaction. The survey is anonymous, i.e. no conclusions can be drawn about you as part of the survey. Only the results of your answers to the individual questions are transmitted to us as part of the survey. Your IP address will not be saved.
You occasionally have the opportunity to provide us with one or more contact options (e-mail address or telephone/mobile number) after completing the survey, which we will use to send you your reward (e.g. a voucher).
Please note that even when participating in an anonymous survey, SurveyMonkey collects information about the device and application used by the survey participant to complete the survey. This includes the IP address, the version of the operating system, the device type, the device ID/MAC address, information on the system and performance and the browser type. If a mobile device is used to participate in the survey, the UUID of this device is also recorded by SurveyMonkey. SurveyMonkey also collects cookies and tracking services from first and third-party providers and SurveyMonkey's servers keep log files. As SurveyMonkey Europe UC is a subsidiary of Momentive Inc. based in the USA, it is possible that data collected by SurveyMonkey may also be transmitted to the USA. Momentive Inc. is subject to the adequacy decision of the European Commission of July 10, 2023 (so-called Data Privacy Framework) pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR (the current certificate can be found here: https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list). Further information on data protection at SurveyMonkey can be found at: https://de.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/. An data processing agreement has also been concluded between SurveyMonkey and us.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data.
The legal basis for the use of SurveyMonkey is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR in conjunction with recital 47 no. 7 GDPR or your consent when conducting and sending the invitation to participate in the survey (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR.
Duration of storage.
For details on the storage of your data, please refer to SurveyMonkey's privacy policy https://de.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/. The data stored by us for the survey will be deleted after completion and evaluation of the survey.
Objection and removal option.
For details on how to object to and delete your data, please refer to SurveyMonkey's privacy policy https://de.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/. To have any data stored in our systems deleted as well, please send your objection to our Customer Happiness Team using the contact form.
Online shop
We require your personal data in order to process your order from our online shop. To this end, we require your title, first names, surnames, email address, delivery address, billing address and telephone number for queries regarding your order. If you wish to create a Tonie-Account in our online shop, we will store your personal data so that you do not have to re-enter it for every order. This saves you time and stops you from making any mistakes when typing. Furthermore, it gives you personalised access to your order history and you can specify individual user settings if you desire them. You also need a Tonie-Account to set up the Toniebox and use special functions of
my
tonies, including the Audio Library. When you create a Tonie-Account in the shop, all you need to begin is your email address and a password chosen by you. Later when you make an order the following personal data of yours is additionally stored: title, forename, surname, delivery address, billing address, payment method (setting the default during the first purchase) and your telephone number (information for queries regarding your order).
Data processing for order fulfilment through Amazon
Orders are fulfilled by the service provider 'Amazon' (Amazon EU S.à r.l., 5, Rue Plaetis 2338, Luxembourg) as part of the 'Fulfilment by Amazon' program. Your personal data is shared with Amazon exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling your online order. It is transferred in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1)(b) and only to the extent necessary for the order's fulfilment. Furthermore, we obtain your data when you use Amazon customer service in connection with your order.
Any other data processing that extends beyond the data processing explained above is the responsibility of Amazon. Further information about data protection at Amazon and Amazon's privacy notice can be viewed
here
.
Audio Library
If you possess a Tonie-Account and log in with it at my.tonies.com, you can use our Audio Library. When creating a Tonie-Account in
my
tonies, all you need is your email address and a password that you choose. For orders for Audio Library content, we also require your personal data in order to fulfil your order. To this end, we require your title (voluntary), forename, surname, billing address, the country to which your IP address belongs (but not the IP address itself) and telephone number (voluntary information for queries regarding your order). If you use the Audio Library to assign previously purchased Audio Library content to your Tonies and manage your purchased content, we do not require any personal data for this apart from your Tonie-Account log-in details.
Tonie-Blog
We offer the option of commenting on our Tonie-Blog posts on our website at
tonies.com
. If you use this option, your comment, information about the time the comment was submitted and the username or pseudonym chosen by you will be stored and published. Additionally, the IP address assigned by your Internet service provider will be logged as well. We will also ask for your email address, and while we will store it, we will not publish it. We store this personal data for security reasons and in case you violate third-party rights through a comment that you leave or in case you post unlawful content. Storing this personal data enables us to clear ourselves of wrongdoing in the event of a breach of law. We do not disclose your personal data to third parties except when such disclosure is legally required or serves as legal defence for us.
Customer care by telephone
If you contact our customer care by telephone, your telephone number and email address, as well as other information that you provide to our customer care staff, are recorded, stored and assessed for the purpose of processing your enquiry. Doing this serves the purpose of answering your enquiry and improving our products and the quality of our service. If you are required to provide your Toniebox ID for an answer to your enquiry as part of such a support request, the previously anonymous data of yours about operational events may possibly be linked with the personal data that you provide in connection with the enquiry. However, our customer care staff will actively let you know about this in such cases before a link is made, and you can, of course, refuse it at any time.
Customer care through the contact form
If you send us enquiries through our contact form, your information from the contact form, including the contact details that you voluntarily provide on it (personal data), your name and your email address, are automatically stored with us for the purpose of processing your enquiry and in case of follow-up questions until the relevant matter has been conclusively resolved. Naturally we do not share this data without your consent.
Customer care by live chat (guuru) (EU, UK, and Swiss customers only)
We provide a chat function operated by guuru-AG on our website; the principal place of business for guuru AG is Bösch 67, 6331 Hünenberg, Switzerland. However, no data for it is collected through our website and no data for it is stored with tonies GmbH. If you ask a question through this chat function, a real person from a selected group of customers of tonies GmbH answers you. tonies GmbH is not responsible for content that is exchanged in chats. The data sent in chats is transferred directly to guuru and stored for analysis purposes. The personal data provided is treated as confidential and regularly erased by guuru after the relevant enquiry is processed. Data is not forwarded to third parties for marketing purposes.
Further information about the processing of data by guuru can be found in the
guuru privacy policy
. If you have questions, you can also contact the guuru data protection officer directly:
dataprotection@guuru.com

Data protection policy for the use of Facebook plug-ins (e.g. Like button)
Plug-ins for the Facebook social network provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland, are integrated into our website. According to Facebook’s statement the collected data will be transferred to the USA and other third-party countries too.
An overview of the Facebook social media elements is available under the following link: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
If the social media element has been activated, a direct connection between your device and the Facebook server will be established. As a result, Facebook will receive information confirming your visit to this website with your IP address. If you click on the Facebook Like button while you are logged into your Facebook account, you can link content of this website to your Facebook profile. Consequently, Facebook will be able to allocate your visit to this website to your user account. We have to emphasize that we as the provider of the website do not receive any information on the content of the transferred data and its use by Facebook. For more information, please consult the Data Privacy Policy of Facebook at:
https://de-de.facebook.com/privacy/explanation
.
If your approval (consent) has been obtained the use of the abovementioned service shall occur on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 TTDSG (German Telecommunications Act). Such consent may be revoked at any time. If your consent was not obtained, the use of the service will occur on the basis of our legitimate interest in making our information as comprehensively visible as possible on social media.
Insofar as personal data is collected on our website with the help of the tool described here and forwarded to Facebook, we and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland are jointly responsible for this data processing (Art. 26 GDPR). The joint responsibility is limited exclusively to the collection of the data and its forwarding to Facebook. The processing by Facebook that takes place after the onward transfer is not part of the joint responsibility. The obligations incumbent on us jointly have been set out in a joint processing agreement. The wording of the agreement can be found under: https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum. According to this agreement, we are responsible for providing the privacy information when using the Facebook tool and for the privacy-secure implementation of the tool on our website. Facebook is responsible for the data security of Facebook products. You can assert data subject rights (e.g., requests for information) regarding data processed by Facebook directly with Facebook.
If you assert the data subject rights with us, we are obliged to forward them to Facebook. Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission.

Data protection policy for the use of Facebook Pixel
To measure conversion rates, this website uses the visitor activity pixel of Facebook. The provider of this service is Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland. According to Facebook’s statement the collected data will be transferred to the USA and other third-party countries too. This tool allows the tracking of page visitors after they have been linked to the website of the provider after clicking on a Facebook ad. This makes it possible to analyze the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes and to optimize future advertising campaigns.
For us as the operators of this website, the collected data is anonymous. We are not in a position to arrive at any conclusions as to the identity of users. However, Facebook archives the information and processes it, so that it is possible to make a connection to the respective user profile and Facebook is in a position to use the data for its own promotional purposes in compliance with the Facebook Data Usage Policy. This enables Facebook to display ads on Facebook pages as well as in locations outside of Facebook. We as the operator of this website have no control over the use of such data.
The use of these services occurs on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG. You may revoke your consent at any time. Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission. Details can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum and
https://de-de.facebook.com/help/566994660333381

Data protection policy for the use of Facebook Website Custom Audiences
We use Facebook 'Website Custom Audiences'. The provider of this service is Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland. It involves the use of a Web beacon to identify website visitors.
A direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server is established through this Web beacon when visiting our website and apps. This provides Facebook with the information that you have visited our website with your IP address. Facebook can then match the visit to our website with your user account and will use this information to personalise the display of Facebook advertisements.
In the event that you have given us your consent to the use of Facebook Custom Audiences, we will share these data with Facebook to put Facebook in a position to send you compatible ads. These data may also be used to defined target audiences (Lookalike Audiences).
We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the pages, have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by Facebook. We can only select which segments of Facebook users (such as age, interests) should be displayed our advertising. In doing so, we use one of two working methods of Custom Audiences, in which no data records, in particular no email addresses of our users - neither encrypted nor unencrypted - are transmitted to Facebook.
Facebook processes these data as our contract processor. For details, please consult the user agreement of Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience. 16 / 22 The use of these services occurs on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit a GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG. You may revoke your consent at any time. The transfer of date to the USA is based on the standard contract clauses of the EU Commission. For details please see: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience and https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/dataprocessing.
Data protection policy for the processing through our social media appearances
We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found below.
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter etc. can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or banner ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:
If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.
Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.
Legal basis: Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g., consent within the meaning of Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. a GDPR).
Responsibility and assertion of rights: If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g., Facebook).
Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.
Storage time: The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular, retention periods - remain unaffected.
We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators for their own purposes. For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g., in their privacy policy, see below).

Data Protection Policy for the use of Braze
To use the features of the App, you are required to log in to the App. To log in to the App, you need a user account.
When you register in our App or on my.tonies.com, we store the information you provide, such as your email address, first and last name. For these purposes, we use a CRM service provided by Braze Inc, 330 West 34th Street, New York, NY 10001, USA ("Braze"). In this context, Braze acts for us as a so-called data processor.
The processing of personal data in the context of registration, logging in and the use of the functions is carried out for the performance of our service offered via the mytonies App and is therefore based on GDPR Article 6 (1) lit. b.
We use Braze in our App and on mytonies.com to analyze your usage behavior. This allows us to draw conclusions about your usage behavior in order to improve our notifications and ensure that you only receive information that is of interest to you. When you use the App or services on mytonies.com, the information listed below is collected and analyzed by Braze. Braze uses an identifier (ID) that allows analysis of your use of our services. Braze collects information about your newsletter registration, your user behavior regarding the newsletter, the push notoficatoins (e.g. open rates) as well as the use of our App and website, purchase information as well as campaign information for the purpose of direct targeting (direct marketing) as well as analysis and campaign optimization.
The legal basis for this processing activity is a legitimate interest according to GDPR Article 6 (1) lit. f. The legitimate interest we pursue in processing the data explained above is our interest in a user- and needs-oriented design of our offers. A conflicting interest is not apparent in particular because you can object to the processing at any time. If you no longer wish to be recorded by Braze in the future, you can contact us at any time using the contact information provided in the
imprint
.
When using Braze, there is no transfer of personal data processed by Braze to a third country. Braze is based in a third country, i.e. a country in which there is no level of data protection equivalent to the GDPR. Your data will be stored and processed exclusively on European servers. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that due to the company's headquarters in the USA, a data transfer to the USA cannot be completely excluded.
The transfer of data to Braze is permissible according to GDPR Article 46 (2) lit. c as we have concluded the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission ("EU Standard Contractual Clauses"), the wording of which is available here https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=DE.

We use Braze to link advertising campaigns to registration and subsequent use of the tonies services and to measure their success. We also use the functionality provided by Braze to contact you and provide you with news about our products and services and our campaigns in various ways. For these purposes, we use your email address, your first and last name, a pseudonymized user ID automatically generated by Braze, and your advertising IDs automatically generated by your mobile device's operating system (Identifier for Advertising ("DFA") for iOS or Google Advertising ID ("AAID") for Android).
If you have given your consent, you will receive personalized advertising and marketing content via the following communication channels: Email, SMS, push notification, in-app notifications.
The legal basis for this is your consent (GDPR Article 6 (1) lit. a). Your consent is optional and can be revoked at any time. You can unsubscribe from push notifications at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.
We use your email address, which we have received in the context of the sale of a good or service, for the electronic sending of advertising for our own goods or services that are similar to those that you have already purchased from us, unless you have objected to this use.
The legal basis for the processing is our overriding legitimate interest in direct advertising (GDPR Article 6 (1) lit. f). You can object to this use at any time by notifying us. The contact details for exercising the objection can be found in the
imprint
. You can also use the link provided for this purpose in the advertising medium, e.g. in the e-mail.
Data used for marketing purposes will be stored in pseudonymized form and passed on to Braze. This data will be deleted as soon as you have revoked your consent given for marketing purposes.
We delete data relevant to the contract, such as your e-mail address and name, five years after the termination of the contract for the use of our service. The contract for the use of our service ends, for example, by deleting your mytonies account.
