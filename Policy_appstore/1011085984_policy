Access, Correction, Portability
You can request access to the personal information we hold about you; If any personal information we hold is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or update it. Where feasible, we will provide you or a third party of your choice with your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
Deletion
You can request that we delete your personal information under certain circumstances, such as: when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected; If you withdraw your consent (where consent is the basis for processing); when we have unlawfully processed your information or must delete it to comply with legal obligations.
Exceptions:
We may deny deletion requests if retaining information is necessary to:
Fulfill legal obligations
Detect and prevent fraud or illegal activity.
Comply with internal information retention policies related to safety or regulatory requirements.
Object, Restrict, Withdraw
If we process your information based on our legitimate interests, you can object to this processing if you believe it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. You can also object to data processing for direct marketing purposes.
You can ask us to suspend the use of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as: when you contest the data's accuracy; if the processing is unlawful but you prefer restriction instead of deletion; when you need the data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
If you have provided consent for specific processing activities, you can withdraw this consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal.
Automated Decision-Making
You have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which significantly affects you, unless: necessary for entering into or performing a contract; based on your explicit consent; authorized by applicable laws.
In these cases, you have the right to request human intervention, express your viewpoint, and contest the decision.
Exercising Your Rights
To exercise your rights, please submit a request by emailing us at
support@wooplus.com
or through the Feedback Page on the WooPlus app. Your request should include sufficient details to verify your identity (e.g., your registered email address or phone number) and describe your request clearly.
For your protection and that of all members, we may ask for information to verify your identity or authority to act on behalf of a member before responding to your requests. This ensures that only you can access your data and prevents unauthorized control.
We may reject requests for reasons including, but not limited to:
Failure to authenticate your identity; Requests deemed unlawful, invalid, or infringing on the privacy, intellectual property, or rights of another individual. If you are requesting information relating to another member (e.g., copies of messages they sent you), the other member must submit the request themselves.

5. Security
WooPlus has implemented technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We restrict access to personal information to authorized personnel only and regularly review our security procedures to ensure compliance with best practices.
Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will ever occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data secure:
Please log in to WooPlus on a trusted device.
Please don't share the password you use to access your WooPlus Account with anyone else.
Change your password periodically.
Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
6. Data Retention
Personal information can only be kept temporarily for continued service and legitimate purposes, and we retain the information complying with applicable laws. The content stays as long as the account still exists. After your account is terminated, we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:
We adhere to a strict data retention policy that involves deleting most of your data and retaining only limited information for specific purposes, as explained below:
We retain a limited amount of data to fulfill our legal data retention obligations. Additionally, we store records of members' consent to demonstrate compliance with applicable laws.
We maintain limited information based on our legitimate interests. For instance, we keep customer care records and supporting data to help us make informed decisions about customer care, enforce our rights, and defend ourselves in case of claims. We also retain information on past accounts and subscriptions for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. Furthermore, we keep data necessary to prevent banned members from opening a new account for as long as required to ensure the safety and well-being of our members.
Lastly, we maintain information based on our legitimate interests when there is an ongoing or potential issue, claim, or dispute that requires us to keep data. This includes instances where we receive a valid legal subpoena or request for data preservation, in which case we would need to retain data to comply with our legal obligations. We also keep data that may be necessary for legal proceedings.
Please note that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we regret that we can't promise all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.
7. Children's Privacy
Our service is strictly for individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit anyone under the age of 18 to use WooPlus, and we do not knowingly collect information from or market to individuals under this age. If we become aware that a user under 18 has registered and shared personal information with us, we will take prompt action to delete their account and information.
If you suspect that someone on our platform is under the age of 18, please report their profile using the in-app reporting tools. Your cooperation helps us maintain a safe and appropriate community for all members.
8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Policy, simply by posting such change, update, or modification on WooPlus Services and without any other notice to you. Any such change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Services. If any changes are made to this Privacy Policy we will reflect the "Last Revised" date above.

CONSUMER HEALTH DATA PRIVACY POLICY
This
Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy
supplements our
Privacy Policy
and applies specifically to residents of Washington and Nevada.
Collection and Use of Consumer Health Data
While we do not intentionally collect or process "consumer health data" to determine or infer your physical or mental health status, certain jurisdictions define "consumer health data" broadly. As such, some of the information we gather to provide our services may be classified as consumer health data under those laws. We use this data primarily to deliver our services and facilitate meaningful connections between our members.
How We Share Consumer Health Data
We may share consumer health data with the following third parties, where necessary, for the purposes outlined above:
Other Users:
Information you choose to share on your profile or elsewhere on the platform is visible to other users.
Service Providers:
We collaborate with trusted vendors to support our operations, such as hosting, customer support, and ensuring platform security.
Corporate Transactions:
In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or other change in ownership, your data may be disclosed to the relevant parties involved in the transaction.
Legal and Safety Requirements:
We may share your information to comply with legal obligations, assist in preventing fraud or crime, ensure personal safety, or protect our legal rights.
Your Rights
Residents of Washington and Nevada have certain rights regarding their consumer health data, including:
Access:
You can request confirmation about whether we collect or disclose your consumer health data.
Deletion:
You have the right to request deletion of your consumer health data, subject to legal and operational constraints.
Transparency:
You may ask for a list of third parties with whom we have shared your consumer health data.
