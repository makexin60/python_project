General Information
Applicability of the Privacy Policy
We collect and process personal and non-personal data when an individual user or organization (“you” and “your”) uses the services (the “Services”) provided by us through the following sources:
  The online platform “Events by HelloCrowd” available at https://www.hellocrowd.net (“EVENTS”);
  The online platform “&Team by HelloCrowd” available at https://www.andteam.com (“&TEAM”);
  The online platform “Learn by HelloCrowd” available at https://www.learn-app.io (“LEARN”);
  The related software applications; (collectively, the “Platforms”).
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Platforms (the “Third Party Services”), or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate customer agreement (the “Customer Terms”) governs the delivery, access and use of the Services intended to our customers with whom we conclude contracts on the basis of the Customer Terms (the “Customers”), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through such Services (the “Customer Data”). If you are the Customer and your use of the Services is subject to the Customer Terms, you remain the sole controller of the Customer Data.
Responsible Entity
The entity that is responsible for collection and processing of personal data through the Platforms is HelloCrowd, Inc. having a registered place of business at 967 Hymettus Ave., Encinitas, CA92024, the United States of America (“we”, “us”, and “our”).
Our Role as Data Controller and Data Processor
When handling personal data, we may act both as a data controller and data processor. Our role depends on a specific situation. For example, we will act as a data controller when we ask you to submit your personal data that is necessary for your use of the Services (e.g., when you register a user account, make payments, or contact us directly).
We will act as a data processor in the situations when you conclude a service contract with us on the basis of the Customer Terms and become the Customer with respect to the data submitted in relation to the Services, including the Customer Data. For example, if you register on &TEAM as an organization that is looking for employees, you can select what types of personal data should be collected from potential employees. In such a situation, you act as a data controller, whereas we act as a data processor. A copy of our Data Processing Addendum is
available here
.
Notwithstanding our role, we will comply with the applicable obligations and strive to ensure that all personal data collected and processed through the Platforms is handled properly.
Definitions
In this Privacy Policy, you will encounter recurrent terms. We would like to explain you what such terms mean:
“Consent”
means a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous agreement to the processing of personal data;
“Data controller”
means the entity that determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;
“Data processor”
means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the data controller;
“Personal data”
means any information relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by using such information (e.g., name, address, email, phone number, and IP address);
“Processing”
means the use of personal data in any manner, including, but not limited to, collection, storage, erasure, transfer, and disclosure of personal data.
Applicable Laws
We handle personal data in accordance with the applicable data protection laws, including, but not limited to, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Term and Termination
This Privacy Policy enters into force on the effective date indicated at the top of the Privacy Policy and remains valid until terminated or updated by us.

PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY READ THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND IT, AND YOU AGREE TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA THROUGH THE PLATFORMS.

If we intend to collect other types of personal data that are not mentioned in this Privacy Policy;
If we intend to use your personal data for the purposes that are not indicated in this Privacy Policy;

Please note that the submission of the Sensitive Data is entirely optional. It is in your sole discretion whether to provide such Sensitive Data through &TEAM and LEARN. Your voluntary submission of the Sensitive Data constitutes your consent to process the Sensitive Data for the purposes listed in section “The Purposes of Collected Data”.
Failure to Provide Personal Data
If you fail to provide us with the personal data when requested, we may not be able to perform the requested operation and you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Platforms, receive the Services, or get our response.
Personal Data Obtained from Third Parties
Third Party Services
When using the Platforms, you can choose to permit or restrict services and functionalities provided by third parties (the “Third Party Services”). Typically, the Third Party Services are software that integrates with the Services, and you can enable and disable these integrations. Once enabled, the provider of the Third Party Services may share certain information with us. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to the Services, we may receive your user name and email address, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to us to facilitate the integration.
You are strongly encouraged to check carefully the privacy settings and notices of the Third Party Services to understand what information may be disclosed to us. When the Third Party Services are enabled, we are authorized to connect and access information, including some personal data, made available to us in accordance with our agreement with the provider of the Third Party Services. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services.
Contact Information
If you choose to import your contact information from your device (e.g., an address book from the device) and you provide your consent, we may access such information for the purpose of providing the Services.
Third Party Data
We may receive certain information about organizations, industries, users of the Platforms, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful (the “Third-Party Data”). The Third-Party Data may be combined with the Technical Data (as explained in the section “Technical Data”) that we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to ZIP codes or countries. The Third-Party Data may also be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.
Customer Data
If the functionalities of the Services allow, you may submit the Customer Data that includes messages, files, and other types of content generated by you. For example, if you use &TEAM as the Customer, you may routinely submit the Customer Data to us when using the Services. We will have access to the Customer Data to the extent necessary for provision of the Services. We will not access, copy, disclose or use the Customer Data if it is not strictly necessary for provision of the Services requested by you.
Technical Data
When you use the Platforms, we collect certain non-personal data, such as your usage data, Services metadata, log data, device and location information (collectively, the “Technical Data”). The Technical Data includes:
Usage data.
In order to improve the Services, we engage in research about our users. Thus, when you use the Services, we may collect certain technical non-personal data to understand how you use them. Such Technical Data data does not allow us to identify you in any manner.
Services metadata.
When you interact with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way you work. For example, we log the workspaces, channels, people, features, content and links you interact with, the types of files shared and what Third Party Services are used (if any).
Log data.
As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use the the Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.
Device information.
We collect information about devices accessing the Services, including the type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of such device information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.
Location information. We receive information from you that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use the billing address or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. Please note that such approximation of your location does not allow us to locate or identify you in any manner. We may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.
The Purposes of Data
We respect strictest data protection principles. Thus, we collect and process your personal and non-personal data only for specified and legitimate purposes explicitly mentioned in this Privacy Policy. In short, we will use personal data only for the purposes of providing the Services, maintaining the Platforms, conducting research about our business activities, administrative purposes, and replying to your enquiries. The detailed description of the purposes and legal basis for processing of your personal data for each type of data collected by us is provided below (the mandatory personal data is marked with *).

Marketing Communication
We sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about us and the Services. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them. Please note that we will not send you direct marketing messages, such as newsletters, brochures, promotions and advertisements, or contact you by any other means with the purpose to offer you the Services, unless:
We receive your express (“opt-in”) consent to receive such marketing messages. You can opt-out from receiving such marketing messages at any time free of charge by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link contained in any of the messages sent to you; or
We decide to send you marketing messages about our new Services that are closely related to the Services already used by you.
Informational Notices
We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in the Platforms, our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the Services, they will be sent on “if-needed” basis and you may not opt out of them.
Purposes of Customer Data
The Customer Data will be used for the sole purpose of providing you with the requested Services. The legal basis for such use of the Customer Data is performing a contract with you. If you submit any Customer Data through the Platforms as the Customer, the Customer Data will be used by us in accordance with your instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and your use of Services functionality, and as required by the applicable law. Please note that, if you are the Customer, we act as a processor of the Customer Data and you act as a data controller. You may, for example, if the functionalities of the Services allow, use the Services to grant and remove access to the Services, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove the Customer Data and otherwise apply your policies to the Services.
Purposes of Technical Data
We will use the Technical Data in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Platforms, providing the Services, conducting our business activities, and developing new products. The legal basis for such use of the Technical Data is pursuing our legitimate business interests. More specifically, we will use the Technical Data:
To provide, update, maintain and protect the Platforms, our Services, and business.
This includes the use of the Technical Data to support delivery of the Services under the Customer Terms, prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at your request.
As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.
To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions.
If you contact us, we may use the Technical Data to respond.
To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and additional features.
We try to make the Services as useful as possible for you. For example, we may improve search functionality by using the Technical Data to help determine and rank the relevance of content, channels or expertise to you, make the suggestions for the Services based on historical use and predictive models, identify organizational trends and insights, to customize the experience of the Services or create new productivity features and products.
To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.
Aggregated Data
If your personal data is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, it will not be considered personal data and we may use it for any business purpose. To the extent personal data is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under the applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “personal data.” In case your non-personal data is combined with certain elements of your personal data in a way that allows us to identify you, we will treat such aggregated data as personal data.
Retention Period
Personal Data
We will store your personal data in our systems only for as long as such personal data is required for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, you request us to delete your personal data, or until your user account is deleted - whichever comes first. After your personal data is no longer necessary for its purposes and there is no other legal basis for storing it (e.g., we are not obliged by law to store your personal data), we will immediately delete your personal data from our systems.
Customer Data
If you act as the Customer and you submit any Customer Data, we will retain the Customer Data in accordance with your instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Terms and the use of the Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. The deletion of the Customer Data and other use of the Services by you may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain associated Technical Data. For more details, please review the
Help Center
or contact us.
Technical Data
We may retain the Technical Data pertaining to you for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This may include keeping your Technical Data after you have deactivated your account for the period of time needed for us to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
Retention as Required by Law
Please note that, in some cases, we may be obliged by law to store your personal data for a certain period of time (e.g., for accountancy purposes). In such cases, we will store your personal data for the time period stipulated by the applicable law and delete the personal data as soon as the required retention period expires.
How We Share and Disclose Data
In some circumstances, we disclose your personal data to third party service providers (data processors) and other third parties. For example, we may share your personal and non-personal data with entities that provide certain technical support services to us, such as web analytics, data processing, advertising, email distribution, and developing services, or if you explicitly request us to disclose the personal data. This section describes in detail how we share and disclose personal and non-personal data to third parties.
Situations in Which We Share Data
We may share your personal and non-personal data in the following situations:
Upon Customer’s instructions.
We will solely share and disclose the Customer Data in accordance with Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Terms and the use of Services functionality, and in compliance with applicable law and legal process. Please note that, if we act as a data processor, you (as a data controller) determine your own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of personal data, and we do not control how you or any other third parties choose to share or disclose personal data.
Displaying the Services.
When you submit your personal data, it may be displayed to other users in the same or connected Platforms. For example, your email address may be displayed with your profile in the mobile applications related to the Platforms. Please consult the
Help Center
for more information on the functionalities of the Services.
Collaborating with others.

Owners, administrators, authorized users and your other representatives and personnel may be able to access, modify or restrict access to personal data. This may include, for example, your employer using the Services features of LEARN to export logs of your activities carried through the LEARN, or accessing or modifying your profile details.
Third-party service providers and partners.
We may engage third party companies or individuals as service providers or business partners to process personal data and support our business. These third parties may, for example, provide virtual computing and storage services.
Third Party Services.
You may enable Third Party Services. When enabled, we may share personal data with the providers of the Third Party Services. The Third Party Services are not owned or controlled by us and third parties that have been granted access to personal data may have their own policies and practices for its collection and use. Please check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services or contact the provider for any questions.
Corporate Affiliates
. We may share personal data with our corporate affiliates, parents and/or subsidiaries.
During a change to our business.
If we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of our assets or stock, financing, public offering of securities, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such activities (e.g. due diligence), some or all personal data may be shared or transferred, subject to standard confidentiality arrangements.
Aggregated or de-identified data.
We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose. For example, we may share aggregated or de-identified data with prospects or partners for business or research purposes, such as telling our prospective customers the average amount of time spent using the Services.

The third parties that may have access to your personal data are included in our Processors and Sub-Processors policy document.
Security
We take the security of personal data very seriously. We work hard to protect the personal data you provide from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. We implement organizational and technical information security measures to protect personal data, such as anonymization, secured networks, encryption, and limited access to your personal data by our staff. These measures take into account the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology. Should a data breach occur, we will handle such a breach in accordance with our internal information security policies and the requirements set by the applicable law.
We have received internationally recognized security certifications for ISO 27001 (information security management system) and ISO 27018 (for protecting personal data in the cloud). To learn more about current practices and policies regarding the security and confidentiality of the Services, please see our Security Practices available at [

Given the nature of communications and information processing technology, we cannot guarantee that the personal data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
Age Limitations
To the extent prohibited by applicable law, we do not allow anyone younger than 16 years old to use of the Services. Thus, we do not knowingly collect personal data of persons below the age of 16. If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take immediate steps to delete such personal data.
International Data Transfers, Privacy Shield, and Standard Contractual Clauses
We may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one in which you live. For example, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), we may transfer your personal data outside the EEA because we and some of the third parties listed in this Privacy Policy are located outside the EEA. We deploy the following safeguards if we transfer personal data originating from the European Union or Switzerland to other countries not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal data protection:
E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.
