Privacy Policy
PowDay does not collect any data except for what is needed to deliver your selected push notifications.
Push notifications
If you enable notifications, we must store a token and your notification options to send them. PowDay will never use notifications for marketing.
Location tracking
If you enable notifications and select "Only in Whistler", PowDay will create and register a 10Km
geo-fence
. When you enter or leave Whistler, PowDay will turn on or off the notifications you have selected as "Only in Whistler".
If you have only given PowDay access to location "While Using", PowDay will check if you are inside/outside the geo-fence each time you launch the app and update notification only then.
