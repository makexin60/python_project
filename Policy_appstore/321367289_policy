How Your Information May be Used
Information about you may be used for the following purposes:
Provision of the Services
. We may use the information collected about you to provide and improve the Services, and to develop new Services.
Member Profiles
. We may associate information that we have collected about your use of the Services with your registration information and any other information we have about you, as described in this Privacy Policy, thereby creating a profile of you that we may update from time to time ("Member Profile"). This processing of your Member Profile is necessary to deliver the Services tailored according to your specialty and interests (known or inferred), as further described below in Personalize the Services Including Advertising.
Network Profiles
. We may use your registration information, as well as information from Third-Party sources such as IQVIA, to create a profile for you that is viewable by other members of the Medscape Network, which may be associated with content with which you engage and comments you may post (collectively, your "Network Profile").
Communications
. By registering as a member of the Medscape Network, you agree to the use of your registration information and other information collected about you as described in this Privacy Policy to communicate with you about the Services and other information that may be of interest to you. These communications may be conveyed through a variety of channels, subject to applicable law, including emails and may contain advertisements and other promotional materials from third party sponsors, including pharmaceutical companies.
Personalize the Services Including Advertising
.
We may personalize the Services, including the advertising you see within the Medscape Network, on third party websites and in our email communications, based on information included in your Member Profile. For example, a user who WebMD believes is a cardiologist or who has browsed cardiology content with the Medscape Network may be served an advertisement promoting a particular cardiac product within the Medscape Network, on third party websites and/or within an email that a user who WebMD believes is a neurologist or has not browsed cardiology content will not see. We partner with third parties to manage and conduct our advertising activities including advertising on our websites and on third party websites. These third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver this advertising based on your activities and interests as inferred from your use of the Services and other information they have about you. Also, advertisers may use their own cookies and other tracking technologies in the advertisements served to you through the Services, some of which may enable the advertiser to obtain personal information that can be used to specifically identify you, including the fact that you saw the advertisement, to the extent that you have separately provided consent to the advertiser or to the third party providing the tracking technology. Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their advertisements on their behalf and to monitor users' responses to these advertisements through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies. While WebMD generally permits the use of third party tracking technologies based on an understanding that they comply with the WebMD Advertising Policy, we do not have control over these third parties' use of cookies and other tracking technologies or how they manage the information they gather through them and WebMD may be unable to verify compliance with the WebMD Advertising Policy.
Personalization is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us according to which we deliver the Services. We analyze or deduct your preferences and interests based on a number of factors including:
your profile (information provided at the registration time), enriched with other information obtained from third-party sources such as IQVIA to ensure accuracy of our data and comply with our legal obligations;
your interactions with our Services and the Medscape Network, such as:
your viewing and search history;
the time and location of Your access to our Services;
the device you use;
answers you give to surveys and quiz;
our content you post, like, share or recommend, including through social media;
other users with similar tastes and preferences on our Service; and
your interactions with other websites including with the Medscape Network, subject to our Cookies Policy.
This information is used to classify users into different groups or segments, using algorithms and machine-learning. This analysis helps identify links and patterns between different behaviors and characteristics to recommend relevant Services for you. This will never prevent you from accessing and browsing the Services available to you within the Medscape Network.
Verification Purposes
. We may use your information in conjunction with information from third parties to recognize you as a registered member when you visit one of our properties and to verify your identity and/or professional credentials. We may require you to provide proof of your identity, including that you are a healthcare professional, and if you are unable to do so to our reasonable satisfaction, we reserve the right to deny you access to the Services. While we take steps to verify that our members who identify as healthcare professionals are actually healthcare professionals, we make no guarantee as to their identity, professional credentials or licensure status.
Account Management
. We may use your information to administer your account, respond to your inquiries, fulfill your requests and send you administrative communications about the Services.
Investigations
. We may use your information to detect, investigate and defend against fraudulent or unlawful activity, violations of the Medscape Network Terms of Use and to otherwise establish, exercise and defend our legal rights.
Legal Grounds WebMD is relying on to use personal data.
. The Services and Medscape Network provide tailored content from multiple sources through a single interface. We offer a free source of customized information for healthcare professionals. Being a free service, the Medscape Network and Services rely on advertising and partnership revenues to support the development of specialized content designed for practicing healthcare professionals to help in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The optimization of advertising to provide you with relevant commercial communications and messages therefore goes to the heart of our ability to support the creation of high-quality medical content, and is the reason behind many of the uses of personal data described below.
The use of the personal data is necessary, to, respectively:
Perform the contract entered into between WebMD and you in the context of your use of the Services. The performance of the contract includes knowing who you are, your specialty, your preferences, and centers of interests to provide tailored content, including interest-based sponsored content and tailored commercial communications. This is particularly important because the Services are designed to provide recommended content to you, and the Services are not available to the general public.
Respond to WebMD' legitimate interests based on the maintenance and improvement of its Services;
When it comes to:
Newsletters, sending by email interest-based advertising or sharing granular data with sponsors, we process data based on the consent you gave us, our service providers, our sponsors, which may be revoked at any time (we may in some cases act as data processors for our sponsors);
Interest-based advertising on our websites and mobile apps and third-party websites and apps including within the Medscape Network, we process and combine data to enrich your profile to respond to our legitimate interests based on our business model offering free and relevant Services to you. You may oppose the use of certain Cookies and data compiling (see our Cookie notice for more details on how to refuse Cookies and other technologies). Our use of the legitimate interest legal basis is without prejudice to additional requirements on Cookies that may flow from Directive 2002/58 or any subsequent European legislation.
Process your personal data based on your consent to participate to the market research surveys and the performance of the contract entered into between WebMD and you in the context of such market research survey; and
Comply with any legal constraints applicable to WebMD or satisfy WebMD's legitimate interests based on the protection of WebMD's legal rights in connection with the Services and Medscape Network.
Sharing Your Information with Third Parties
Information about your use of the Services may be shared as follows:
Service Providers
. We work with third party service providers to help us provide the Services and to otherwise assist us in the operation of the Medscape Network, including in the areas of email management and deployment, analytics, marketing, advertising, market research, sweepstakes and contest administration, identity and professional credential validation, content distribution, customer service, payment fulfillment, event logistics, website maintenance and data storage and security. We may provide these service providers with personal information about users of our Services so that they can fulfill their responsibilities to us, however, we do require that they agree to limit their use of this personal information to the fulfillment of these responsibilities. To provide you with certain personalization and advertising services described herein, we may share certain information that we may collect from you, such as your email address (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our service provider, LiveRamp Inc. and its affiliates, which may in turn link demographic or interest-based information to your browser. You may opt out of this use
here
.
Advertising and Sponsored Programs
. We may provide your personal information to third party sponsors of advertisements and Sponsored Programs, subject to applicable law. Specifically, when you are exposed to an advertisement through the Services, whether on one of our websites or apps, in an email or through some other means, or when you engage in a Sponsored Program, e.g., access a sponsored information resource, open one of our sponsored emails, WebMD may provide your personal information, such as your name and specialty (but not your email or postal address) to the applicable sponsor and/or its agents on the sponsor's behalf. We may also provide such third parties with details about your engagement with the advertisement or Sponsored Program (e.g., whether you viewed or otherwise interacted with certain content), your answers to any questions contained in the Sponsored Program and information about you that we have received from third parties. Additionally, when you register as a member of the Medscape Network, we may provide your personal information (but not your email or postal address) to potential sponsors of advertisements and Sponsored Programs that may be offered or provided to you through the Services, subject to applicable law.  Please review the Privacy Policies of these third parties to familiarize yourself with their practices. All advertisements and Sponsored Programs (including any links to Sponsored Programs) made available within the Medscape Network, including through emails, will be identified to you by the label Advertisement, Information from Industry, Sponsored, WebMD Professional or some similar designation indicating that the content, which may pertain to a particular medical condition, therapy, product or service, has been selected by a third-party sponsor.
Member Profiles
. Subject to applicable law, WebMD may provide Member Profiles, and portions thereof, (excluding contact information and information about your participation in specific named CME and CE activities) to third parties, including our advertising customers, which these third parties may use for their business purposes including marketing.
Network Profiles
. Your Network Profile may be viewable by other members of the Medscape Network for personalization purposes described above and to allow you to view and connect with other members of the Medscape Network.
Market Research
. If you receive remuneration for participating in a market research program offered through our Services, we may provide your personal information to our payment fulfillment vendor so that it can process and deliver your payment to you and for its recordkeeping and regulatory compliance purposes, and also to the program sponsor (or the market research company acting on its behalf) for its recordkeeping and regulatory compliance purposes. If you choose to access a survey that is conducted by a third party market research company, we may identify you to this company. Sometimes market research companies send us lists of individuals they wish to reach with particular market research opportunities and we may inform these companies which of these individuals are members of the Medscape Network so that they can manage their recruitment needs accordingly. Also, certain market research opportunities require us or the market research company to contact you directly to conduct the survey, including by telephone. We will inform you in the research invitation if you will be required to provide additional contact information, e.g., phone number, to participate so that you can decide at that time if you wish to proceed with the opportunity. We do not disclose your survey responses to the sponsor in a manner that identifies you.
Continuing Medical Education
. Medscape, LLC (?Medscape?) is jointly accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, the American Nurses Credentialing Center and the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education to deliver continuing education for the healthcare team (collectively, "CME/CE"), which CME/CE activities are hosted by Medscape on Medscape Education (medscape.org), which is part of the Medscape Network. As an accredited entity, Medscape is required to periodically submit personal information about CME/CE participation to the relevant accrediting entities. Medscape and its affiliates that develop independent medical education content (?IME?), including WebMD Global LLC ("WebMD Global"), may provide your personal information to accredited providers that certify CME/CE and IME offered through the Services as required to process your credits, fulfill their reporting obligations to the relevant accreditation bodies, and for their internal recordkeeping and regulatory purposes. Commercial supporters of CME/CE and IME activities receive only aggregated data about the activities that they support including participation and outcomes measurement reports. We may share your personal information among our affiliates for the purpose of sending you a survey with respect to a CME/CE or IME activity.
Live and Virtual Events
. When you register for and/or attend certain promotional webinars and non-CME/IME live and virtual events, we may report your participation and personal information (such as your name, specialty and contact information) to the partners and sponsors of such programs.

Adverse Event Reporting
. If you provide us information about an adverse event regarding a pharmaceutical product or medical device, we may be required to report such information along with your contact information to the manufacturer as required for it to fulfill its reporting obligations to the applicable regulatory authority.

In the event of such a change, your personal information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as may be modified as described below.

Platform Privacy Policy
Updated: January 16, 2025
This policy applies to PulsePoint’s platforms and services, including PulsePoint’s ad exchange, demand-side platform, and data analytics product(s) (collectively, the “Platforms”), and it explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information on our platforms as well as your rights with regard to that information.
‍
WHO WE ARE
PulsePoint, Inc. (“PulsePoint”) operates several technology platforms that facilitate ad placement for advertisers on mobile applications, websites and other digital channels. If you have any questions regarding the use or privacy of your data, please email
dataprivacy@pulsepoint.com
.
Our headquarters is located at:
283-299 Market Street
2 Gateway Center, 4
th
Floor
Newark, NJ 07102

PulsePoint is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), an association dedicated to responsible data collection use in advertising. PulsePoint also adheres to the specifications of the IAB EU Transparency & Consent Framework for purposes of compliance with EU data protection laws. Our Vendor Number with IAB Europe is 81.
‍
WHAT WE DO
PulsePoint’s Platforms help advertisers and publishers provide advertising over the internet and other channels, such as digital billboards or smart TVs. Advertising on these channels helps to keep content available to you to enjoy and, in many cases, helps to keep your access to that content free. Additionally, the Platforms allow for advertisers to show advertising to you that is relevant to your interests, with the hope that you only see ads that may provide beneficial products and services for you.
With respect to our ad exchange, PulsePoint works with publishers and other content providers to help them sell their advertising space, which in turn helps them to fund their content or apps. With respect to our demand-side platform, also known in the industry as a “DSP,” we work with advertisers who will purchase that advertising space in order to advertise their goods and services to consumers who may be likely to be the right audience for those ads. We may also measure and report on how often an ad was seen, and how effective that ad was by metrics given to us by the advertiser. To do this, we receive and share “pseudonymous” personal data – data such as IP addresses, cookies, and other unique identifiers – that we receive or may assign to you to remember who “you” are, but that do not directly identify you or your direct contact information.
Our Platforms may also use data that we collect or purchase to help us determine certain information like, for example, if there are groups of devices that might be related to each other, such devices that all likely belong to the same person. This helps our advertisers to better manage advertising campaigns, and also limits how often the same person may see the same advertisement.
‍

‍
INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT
How we collect information:
When a person browses the internet, their browser or device may request advertisements from PulsePoint’s Platform. Through the serving of those advertisements or through other Platform analytics, we may collect or otherwise receive information that is linked to your computer or device that may reflect how you interact with a webpage, the advertisements you view or click, or other information from your mobile device. As a result, our Platform may collect data from partners sending us requests for ads on websites, apps, smartTVs, digital billboards, or other advertising channels; through cookies and pixels; through clients or partners providing data to us; through clients and partners using our Platform to collect data; and through the delivery of advertising. We also license data from third-party data providers in order to provide better targeting for our advertising clients.
In addition, PulsePoint is part of the Internet Brands family of companies, and is a subsidiary of WebMD Health Corp. Other companies within the Internet Brands group, including WebMD, may have access to information collected by PulsePoint, and PulsePoint may also have access to information collected by the Internet Brands group of companies.
Types of information we may collect:
Most of the information PulsePoint collects is either non-personally identifiable data, which is data that does not identify you in any way but may be associated with your browsing behavior, or pseudonymous personal data. Under many US State Privacy Laws, this data may be considered “personal information.” For example, when you visit a website or click an ad, we may collect information such as:
Websites you have visited and related information, such as pages visited or the time of day you visited the website;
Ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the time of day of your visit, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser’s website or purchased the product or service advertised;
Apps visited, the start and stop time of a use session, your time zone and your network connection type;
Mobile device information, such as the type and model, software version, manufacturer, operating system (e.g., iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g., Chrome or Safari), applications used and the version of such applications, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID), or unique device identifier (a number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer), sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID;
Your Internet protocol (IP) address;
Location information, such as your zip code or approximate geographic area provided by your ISP or by location services and GPS features of a website or mobile device. GPS location may be shared with us if you have opted to provide that information a publisher or other content provider who is responsible for obtaining your prior permission to share that data with us. We may also infer geolocation of your device based on data collected through, for example, a WiFi identifier;
Demographic information such as age range, gender, and income range;
Information About Healthcare Providers, such as their publicly available information as registered on the National Provider Identifier Registry
‍
Health Information
PulsePoint specializes in health advertising and may collect and use general health-related information when delivering ads, based on interest in topics found on sites or ads that such a user has interacted with in the past. For example, if you have previously interacted with content that has to do with skin care, PulsePoint may collect that information about your interaction with that content and you may subsequently be shown an ad on another page for skin care-related products and services. We do not, however, collect sensitive health information like a user’s specific health condition or diagnosis.
We also may contract with third parties to license data that are de-identified data related to past, present or future medical conditions and treatment of those conditions, including filled prescription data. This data has been de-identified in compliance with HIPAA de-identification standards and we use the data in compliance with HIPAA. PulsePoint will never attempt to re-identify this data back to a specific individual and we follow federal, state and local laws to ensure this data remains de-identified.  Any de-identified data relating to medical conditions and the treatment of those conditions are only used for informational purposes that direct us as to how and where to bid on ad inventory, and not for direct, 1-1 advertising. We may also collect or license data about prescriptions that healthcare providers may write, but we do not collect or receive (or attempt to collect or receive) data about the patients for whom those prescriptions are written.
HOW WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION
We use the data we collect for the following purposes:
Targeted and Contextual Advertising
. We use the information we acquire to provide optimized, tailored advertising. We may target advertising to the content of a page (known as “contextual” advertising), to an audience of people who enter a general location, to a group of people who may be most likely to be engaged by the particular ad as part of an interest-based segment of population, or to people who have engaged with a particular brand or content before (by something known as “retargeting”).
Advertising insights and performance
. Some data we collect may be used to provide insights about an ad campaign. For example, we may use information gathered from ads we have placed to provide our clients with ad-related services, such as statistical reporting about website activity and the number of ads served, and to provide more ads to end-users based on the specific website URL, or webpage, visited. We may also disclose how frequently the average end user requests pages about a certain category (such as health or finance), or which ads a segment of end-user interacts with on domains across our Platform.
Performance of Service
. In order to provide the services requested by our clients and publisher partners, we deliver ads on publishers’ pages and apps, create audiences for targeting, provide analyses of ad campaigns, limit the number of times a person sees the same ad, associate devices that may relate to each other, determine whether certain purchases are attributed to viewing a particular ad, and other ad reporting services.
Inferred Characteristics
. When we collect data about consumers who interact with content, including interacting with ads, we may infer characteristics about those consumers. For instance, if a person consumes content about womens’ health, we may infer that the person is a woman who may also be interested in fitness and exercise.
Fraud Detection and Security
.
We may use the data to protect our Platform and our clients against fraud, as well as to protect the safety of the data we hold on our systems. We may be able to detect malicious or fraudulent activity through our services by using and reviewing the data.
Product Functionality and Improvement
. We use the data to operate our services, for aggregate statistics, to improve our services and functionalities, and for other internal business purposes.
Communication and Legal Disclosures
. We may use your information to respond to you if you reach out to us directly with questions or concerns; we may also disclose data to legal authorities or regulators if required by applicable law.
‍
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
PulsePoint discloses information that it collects to the following categories of third parties:
Affiliates
, which includes our parent companies, such as WebMD and Internet Brands, and sister companies, affiliates within the Internet Brands family.
Demand and Supply Partners,
who may receive information as part of our services on the ad exchange.
Data Vendors,
which may be consent management platforms, identity resolution providers, and other companies that help to provide us with data-related services in order to allow us to run our services in a privacy-focused manner.
Service Providers and Subcontractors,
who only provide services on our behalf, at our direction, and for no other purpose. We may share data with these service providers in order to ensure our platforms and technology work properly.
Mergers and Acquisitions
, where we may share data in connection with a corporate merger or acquisition by another company.
Law Enforcement or Regulatory Authorities
, where we may be compelled by law or other legal authority, to comply with a court order, or to otherwise cooperate in legal proceedings, including if we determine it necessary in connection with an investigation.
Clients
, for Healthcare Providers only – we share certain publicly available data such as NPI numbers, in connection with browsing behavior associated with those NPI numbers, with our clients who purchase those specific services and have signed contracts with us that include terms on protection of privacy.
‍
We may share certain information with Google. Where we share information with Google, Google uses the information to deliver its services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you may see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. You can review Google’s Privacy & Terms page
here
.
Please do note that sometimes, the ads we deliver as part of our services may include third party tracking technologies that we do not control, such as tags, pixels, cookies, etc. which may enable parties other than PulsePoint and its partners to collect data. These third parties most often are contracted by the advertiser or demand partner to measure performance of the advertisement, check for ad fraud, or some other purpose. We do not have control over those parties and their tracking technologies, and this policy does not cover those technologies, the collection of data through them, or the use of that data by those third parties.
USE OF COOKIES
We collect information about users through technologies such as cookies, pixels, tags, web beacons, or other similar technologies. “Cookies” are small data files that are stored by your web browser on your computer. When you visit a webpage, the cookie sends back data about that visit. “Pixel tags” are small graphic images (usually invisible) that can be embedded in content and ads on a webpage that track usage of websites and effectiveness of communication. These pixel tags can then be used to recognize our cookies and to monitor certain user interactions with a website.
‍Cookies and these other technologies are important and useful because they allow us to recognize your device and remember information about you, such as your preferred language and other general settings. Most of the cookies are stored in your browser, which usually gives you the ability to manage them (though browsers for mobile devices may not offer this possibility).
‍You have several choices when it comes to opting out of the collection of information about your web browsing activities through cookies. You can also find information about opting out on the DAA website. For additional information, please review our
Cookie Policy
.
OPT OUTS AND YOUR CHOICES OVER INFORMATION WE SHARE
You have various options to opt out of our Platform for targeted advertising. Opting out does not prevent you from seeing ads; it simply means that we will no longer collect data for the purpose of interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising, and you will no longer receive ads based on your historical viewing interests, personal characteristics, consumer segments, or other information. You may still receive contextual ads, as described above.
Note that different devices require separate opt-outs because each device type uses different technologies, and many of the opt-out technologies available are browser- or cookie-based so they will only apply to those specific browsers or cookies.
Your options include:
DAA Opt Out.
Because PulsePoint adheres to the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles, you can opt out of targeted advertising by participating companies (including PulsePoint) by clicking
here
.
NAI Opt Out.
You may also opt out of targeted advertising from PulsePoint and/or other advertising networks that are also members of the NAI. You may access the NAI’s opt-out tool

.
TV Opt Out.
Many connected TVs and related devices offer a choice mechanism similar to those offered by mobile devices which PulsePoint will honor. In order to exercise your choices with respect to CTV or OTT devices, please visit:
https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/
.
Web Form Opt Out.
To opt out from our database, you can submit a request through our webform,

‍
The DAA and NAI opt-out tools are cookie-based. It signals your preferences to us so that we do not collect data online or deliver ads for the purpose of interest-based/targeted advertising. These tools will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies. If you delete an opt out cookie or all cookies from a browser’s cookie files, change web browsers or change computers, you will no longer be opted out of our data collection and ad targeting, and we may place a new cookie unless an opt-out cookie is against reset on that browser. Opting out using one browser on one computer will not opt you out of using any other browser on the same or another computer.
If you are using a mobile device, your mobile device may offer settings to limit or disable mobile apps from gathering certain information. You should check the settings for the app and your device. PulsePoint honors the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your device and select “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android).
You may also set a preference on your browser through a browser-based opt out signal called “Global Privacy Control.” This signal is only available on certain browsers and is browser-specific, so it will only apply to the browser on which you opt to use it. However, PulsePoint honors this signal when it is passed through to us. You can learn more about GPC
here
.
LiveRamp
We may share information that we collect from you, such as your IP address or other information about your browser or operating system with certain service providers, including LiveRamp, Inc. LiveRamp returns an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. You may opt out of this use
here
.
Healthcare Providers
If you are a healthcare provider (“HCP”) with a registered NPI number, you may request that your NPI number and other personal information be removed from PulsePoint’s NPI database at any time by submitting a request

If you are located in the EEA and visit a site or other content provider that happens to work with PulsePoint and uses the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework, that publisher should provide you with an option to choose which third parties you wish to allow access to your device and information.
COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY OTHERS
This Privacy Policy applies only to information gathered by us in connection with our Platform. There are other companies involved in collecting information and serving ads. The use of third-party pixels, cookies, and other technologies on websites that end-users visit, in apps that end-users use, and in ads served to end-users should be described by the privacy policies associated with those websites, apps, and ads. We have no responsibility for the collection, use, or disclosure of information by those third parties via such websites, apps, or ads.
SECURITY
We use reasonable security measures to protect the data in our possession. However, no method of transmission or storage of data is 100% secure. To the extent we provide your data to any third parties, we request that they use reasonable and industry standard security measures to protect your information.
DATA RETENTION
Information we acquire through our Platform is generally deleted within 45-60 days but may be retained in PulsePoint’s internal network for up to 18 months from the date of collection before deletion.
We retain information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your data, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
ACCESS, CORRECTION, AND DELETION REQUESTS
If you would like to access, correct, update, or request deletion of the data we have on file for you, you may submit such requests
here
. Alternatively, you may email us at
dataprivacy@pulsepoint.com

th
Floor, Newark, NJ 07102. We may take reasonable steps to confirm your identity in an effort to prevent identity theft. Also, please note that in general, we only have pseudonymous data on any given individual (other than HCPs) and may not be able to link any data we have to your personally identifiable data and as such, we may not be able to complete certain rights requests.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
In the interest of the privacy of children, we do not knowingly collect information from or target end users under the age of 16. Our Platform is neither developed for nor directed at children. If we learn we have collected or received information from a minor under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will endeavor to delete that information.
CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS
Our Platform is based in the United States and operates under United States law. If you are located outside of the United States, the information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States and in other countries where the privacy laws may not be the same as the laws where you reside and, in some cases, may not be as protective. Additional considerations apply to the collection, use, and disclosure of information from individuals who live in the EEA.
DO NOT TRACK (“DNT”) AND GLOBAL PRIVACY CONTROL (“GPC”)
Certain web browsers allow you to turn on settings that automatically send a signal to companies you interact with online to indicate you would like to opt out of having your data shared or sold. PulsePoint has implemented and will honor GPC. PulsePoint is also a signatory to the IAB’s MSPA and recognizes the GPP consent string in accordance with IAB guidance.
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA

In addition to the privacy rights listed below for certain US Residents, California Residents have the right to limit the use of sensitive personal information that we may collect about such residents.

This privacy policy (our “Privacy Policy”) explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information on our Platform.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information we may collect and use when you visit our PulsePoint owned and operated website(s) (“Websites”), as we do not use any information collected through our Websites in our Platform. To learn about the information we collect through our Websites, please visit PulsePoint’s Website privacy policy, which is available

What Types of Information Do We Collect?
‍Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”)
We and our service providers (publishers, advertising partners, or third party data providers from whom we license data from) may automatically collect information that is linked to your computer or device and may reflect how you interact with a webpage or the ads you view or click.  We or our service providers may also collect Non-PII from your mobile device or from apps on your mobile device. The Non-PII that we collect does not directly identify you personally, but it may enable us to recognize your computer or device over time. For example, when you visit a webpage or click on an ad, we or our service providers may collect information, which includes, but is not limited to:
• which websites you have visited and information about your visit, including pages visited, what time of day you visited those websites, and more;
• information about the ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the time of day of your visit, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser’s website or purchased the product or service advertised;
• information regarding the app visited, session start/stop time, time zone, and network connection type (e.g., WiFi, cellular);
• information about your mobile device, such as the type and model, software version, manufacturer, operating system (e.g., iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari), applications used and the version of such applications, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID), or unique device identifier (a number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer), sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID;
• your Internet protocol (IP) address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to a computer when surfing the web);
• CTV/OTT information about video content viewed on a device or app
• your location information, such as your zip code or the approximate geographic area provided by your Internet service provider (ISP) or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device or website when location services have been enabled.  We may also infer the geo-location of your device based on data collected through, for example, a WiFi identifier that the device is connected to.
We may also collect Non-PII from third parties that is not linked to your computer or mobile device for use in our Platform.  Any information we receive from third parties is used to maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you.
In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), this information may be considered PII (as defined below) under applicable data protection laws.
Please see our EEA Supplement
for more information on the lawful grounds on which we process your information and data protection rights which you have if you are an EEA visitor.
If you are a California resident, or provide us with the Personal Information of a California resident please see the following additional terms:

‍Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)
PII is information unique to you that may be used to directly identify you individually. We may acquire PII from our publishers or advertising partners or other third parties, but only where we have contractually required that these third parties have obtained your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your PII to us. Depending upon the source, the PII may include information such as email address, gender, or certain specific demographic and other information. More precise location positioning, or location information combined with other data, may make it possible to pinpoint an exact location, which in some instances could be considered PII.
Sensitive Data
Certain PII and Non-PII may also be considered “Sensitive Data.” Some examples of Sensitive Data are your social security number and financial account numbers. Sensitive Data can also include certain types of information about your race or ethnicity, or information related to your health, such as information on certain past, present, or future medical conditions and treatment of those conditions (sometimes also referred to as protected health information or “PHI”), prescriptions you have filled, laboratory results, and information about your health or wellness, including information regarding sexually transmitted diseases (“Sensitive Health Data”). Here are some examples of the categories of Sensitive Health Data we collect:
Addiction
AIDS/HIV
Alzheimer's
Anorexia/Bulimia
Autism
Bipolar Disorder
Brain Tumor
Cancer
Depression
Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency
Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Hepatic Encephalopathy
Infertility
Menopause
Metastic Melanoma
Multiple Myeloma
Parkinson's
Pregnancy Termination
Psychology/Psychiatry
Schizophrenia
Sexually Transmitted Diseases
Substance Abuse
Unless de-identified, PHI collected and stored by us is also protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”).
How Do We Use Your Information?
We use the information we acquire to better target and provide insights about an ad campaign. For example, we may use both PII and Non-PII gathered from ads we have placed to provide our clients with ad-related services, such as statistical reporting about website activity and the number of ads served, and to provide more ads to end-users based on the specific website URL, or webpage, visited. We also use the information we acquire to serve ads to more targeted audiences as explained below. We consider your PII, Sensitive Data (including Sensitive Health Data), and precise location information to be confidential information. Accordingly, we will obtain your consent, or, when we acquire that information from third parties, we will request that they obtain it in compliance with applicable law, and where required by applicable law or our self-regulatory obligations, secure your consent to provide the information to us and for us to use and share your information with others as explained in this Privacy Policy, including for interest based advertising (“IBA”) purposes.
‍Segments
‍We use the information we acquire to deliver ads to the most relevant recipients. For example, we may use PII and Non-PII to develop audience segments, or groupings of individuals with common interests or characteristics, and deliver ads to the individuals within a segment, or to the websites frequented by users of a particular segment, that we determine are relevant to that segment. So, for example, if you are a student, we may deliver ads for school course offerings or financial aid.
Segments may be based on demographic characteristics such as age and gender, geographic area, and other categories derived from various information, including purchasing tendencies. Segments may also be based on certain medical conditions, such as flu or diabetes, or other medical conditions that are considered sensitive, such as cancer. Here are the health segments we use:
Allergies

Arthritis
Asthma
Beauty
Blood Sugar Management

Our Platform serves both contextual and targeted/IBA.
Contextual Ads
‍Placing an ad relevant to the content on the webpage is commonly referred to as contextual advertising. These ads are targeted to content categories only, meaning that a visitor of a webpage sees an ad relevant to the content found on the webpage visited. Displaying an ad for sneakers on a website that promotes running is an example of contextual advertising. Many of our ads focus on contextual advertising.
‍Targeted Ads
‍We may engage in IBA (or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”)). This may utilize the segments referred to above, and PII and Non-PII derived from browsing habits on the Internet, to target specific ads to individuals. For example, if an advertiser wants us to display ads to individuals who have expressed interest in acne, sun-care products, or advances in treating certain medical conditions, we may serve ads for those products or services to those individuals based on segment data and Internet browsing habits. We may also serve ads to you based on inferences we have made regarding health conditions that may be of interest to you. We may make these inferences using models based on a sample set of other users’ health records, which we then compare with information in our databases to create datasets we can use to make certain predictions or inferences regarding characteristics that may apply to you, including the existence of certain medical conditions. The purpose of such advertising is to serve ads better related to products and services that may be relevant to the interests of the individuals seeing them. We may also engage in IBA utilizing PII or Sensitive Health Data.
‍Retargeting
‍We may serve ads to you based on your previous visits to a website or clicks on an ad. For example, an advertiser might ask us to display a particular ad to people who have recently visited the advertiser’s website. In some instances, a cookie is placed on your computer while at the advertiser’s site, and when that cookie is seen by us on the website of another company in our Platform, we will deliver the advertiser’s ad there. We may also use information collected from mobile apps and browsers to serve ads across devices for the purpose of linking devices to relevant individuals.
‍Geo-Fencing
‍We or our service providers may deliver ads to your mobile device when you are in certain geographic locations. This type of targeted advertising is referred to as “geo-fencing” or “geo-targeting.” Geo-fencing works by placing a “fence” around a certain geographic (“geo”) location.  For example, we or one of our service providers could create a 2 square mile “fence” around a grocery store. When you go inside that fence or target area, we or our service providers may serve you specific ads based on you being in that target area. In the case of the grocery store example, you may, for example, be served ads about the grocery store or a product sold in that grocery store.
With geo-fencing we do not continuously, periodically, or intermittently track your precise location.  The geo location of your device will, however, be provided to us or one of our service partners when you enter the target area, and we may also be provided other Non-PII. Geo-fencing monitors an area and sends notifications either to an app you have on your mobile device or directly to us or our service providers when the boundary is crossed, either in or out. Those apps use this location information to process status updates only if you have geo-location enabled on your mobile device. We will not target you with ads based on your geo-location unless we believe you have provided consent to do so.
If you want to limit or prevent location data from being collected from your device you can adjust this capability through your mobile device settings. Please refer to your applicable device settings for instructions on how to manage your location settings. Additional options for opting out of receiving targeted ads can be found in the “Consumer Choice” section below.
What Information Do We Share?
Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your PII or Sensitive Data with third parties. We share your PII and Sensitive Data with third parties (i) when we have received assurance from the party who gave us that information that you consented to do so; and (ii) so that third parties may bid, purchase, and target ads to you directly or otherwise use or share that information with others for advertising or marketing purposes. As with targeted ads, we may share your PII with third parties so that they may retarget you as well. We may also remove identifying information from PII (de-identify it) therefore rendering it Non-PII, and share that de-identified information with third parties, such as in segments we create.
We may share Non-PII with third parties. For example, we may provide information to others as to the specific ads to which a segment of end-users was exposed, or we may make certain information, such as certain demographic information, about end-users viewing an ad available to buyers and potential buyers of such ads. We may also disclose how frequently the average end-user requests pages about a certain category (such as health or finance), or which ads a segment of end-user interacts with on domains across our Platform.
Although the Non-PII information that we share, including the Non-PII that is not linked to your computer, mobile device, or connected TV or app, does not directly identify you personally, there is a risk that third parties who receive such information from us may be able to re-identify you through other information they gather. We request written assurances from third parties that they will not attempt to re-identify non-PII to any particular individual.
In addition to the uses noted in this Privacy Policy, we also may disclose PII and Non-PII (including Sensitive Data) under the following circumstances: (1) if required by law, such as by a court order, statute, regulation, rule or through legal process; (2) in response to requests from federal, state, local, or foreign law and civil enforcement agencies, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or for law enforcement purposes; (3) in the event of a corporate transaction such as the sale of assets or all or most of PulsePoint’s assets or equity to another company; (4) in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of our creditors; or (5) if we determine it necessary in connection with an investigation or in order to protect our legal rights.
We may also disclose your PII and Non-PII to our affiliates, subcontractors, vendors, and other businesses who provide data processing services to us, or who otherwise process PII for purposes that are either described in this Privacy Policy or notified to you when we collect your PII. For example, we may engage third parties to analyze data or provide marketing assistance. We request written assurances that your information will only be used for the purposes of performing the functions for which we have engaged them.
Legal basis for processing PII (EEA visitors only)If you are a visitor from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the PII described above will depend on the PII concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.  For further information relevant to EEA visitors,

How We Use Cookies
We collect Non-PII through technologies such as “cookies” and “pixel tags” (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels). “Cookies” are small data files that are stored by your web browser on your computer. When you visit a webpage, the cookie sends back Non-PII. “Pixel tags” are small graphic images (usually invisible) that can be embedded in content and ads on a webpage that track usage of our Websites and effectiveness of communication. These pixel tags can then be used to recognize our cookies and to monitor certain user interactions with a website.
‍Cookies and these other technologies are useful because they allow us to recognize your device and remember information about you, such as your preferred language and other general settings. Most of the cookies are stored in your browser, which usually gives you the ability to manage them (though browsers for mobile devices may not offer this possibility). Cookies play an important role.
‍You have several choices when it comes to opting-out of the collection of information about your web browsing activities through cookies.  See the “Consumer Choice” section below for ways to opt-out. You can also find information about opting-out on the DAA website. For additional information,
