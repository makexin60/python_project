Tempest Privacy Policy
This policy was updated on July 18, 2024
At Tempest, we strive to be ethical, simple, good to our people, and good to society. This Privacy Statement explains our intention to also be good to your personal data with clear explanations of what information we collect and how we use/process/share it.
Who we are and our core purposes
This Privacy Statement is about the practices of WeatherFlow-Tempest, Incorporated (DBA "Tempest"). We are the
data controller
, which means that we determine the purposes for, and ways in which, we collect and use personal information. We also use third party data processors, and share your information with other data controllers. More about this below.
Our core purpose for collecting and processing your personal information is to enable you to access the data produced by your WeatherFlow product(s), such as weather stations and meters. We measure our privacy practices against this purpose. If we find that we are collecting or processing more personal information than required to meet these purposes, we will stop doing so.
The personal information we collect about you
We collect information from you directly when you create an account through our Tempest applications, or when you contact us through our help and support system. We may also generate information about you when we’re delivering services, for example when we answer a question you ask through our support system or provide you with access to our apps (including Tempest Weather, HeatAlert, FishWeather, iKitesurf, iWindsurf, SailFlow, WindAlert and Wind & Weather Meter). We only collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary to serve you as a customer.
We collect the following personal information about you:
When you sign up for our newsletter, we collect: your full name and email address so we can deliver the newsletter to the right person. You can unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email you receive.
When you register for an account or purchase a membership to any of our services, we collect: your full name, email address, payment information, your purchase history and product/device preferences, and any other information you voluntarily provide to us.
When you access our website, we collect information such as: pages visited, time of visit, browser or device information, IP address, the URL that referred you, and your language and measurement unit preferences.
When you request customer service or contact us, we collect: your full name, email address, the content of your messages/communications, and internal notes related to the questions you ask.
Your Tempest device may send us information such as device labels, weather data, and precise geographic coordinates.
We do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you think we have collected information about a child, please let us know as soon as possible so we can delete the information.
How we use your personal information
To meet our core purposes – enabling you to access the data produced by your Tempest product(s) – we need to use your personal information to:
Authenticate you (with your email address and password), so only you or those your authorize have access to your account
Manage and deliver any products or services you request from us
Personalize your experience, for example, by displaying weather data in your preferred units
Contact you for the purposes of managing your account
Notify you about issues related to your Tempest product(s)
Notify you about new products and services we offer
Keep your account secure
Investigate and resolve any queries or concerns you raise with us
Automated processing
To make sure we can get the job done well, we use software solutions to automate some services or processes that we provide to you. However, we do not use automated processing to profile you or make decisions about you that affect your legal rights or have a similarly significant effect.
Our lawful grounds for collecting and processing your information
With your consent. We need to collect and process some personal information about you to provide the best experience we can for accessing the data collected by your Tempest product. If you consent, we also make some of your personal information public through our applications and API, so that others can benefit from your Tempest product’s data as well.
To perform our contractual obligations to you. This includes but is not limited to providing you access to the services; processing customer service requests; sending you order confirmations and updates; processing payment for your orders; performing our contractual obligations to you under our Terms of Use; and providing you with access to your data.
For legitimate business interests which outweigh the general privacy rights of individual data subjects. This includes but is not limited to analyzing and improving our services and business operations; ensuring the security and availability of the services; and monitoring use of the services to prevent fraud or abuse.
To comply with a legal obligation or requirement. We use and process your personal information when we believe doing so is necessary to comply with laws and regulations, pursuant to a judicial authorization, or to exercise or defend our legal rights or those of a third party.
Who we share your personal information with
We do not share your personal information with third parties unless we have your permission or a legitimate need to do so. This means, we limit sharing your personal information to the following circumstances:
With your consent. If we get your permission to share your personal information, we will tell you the specific purpose for which we are obtaining your consent, and we will not share your personal information beyond that purpose.
With third party service providers and agents. We need to share your personal information with some of our service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our business functions. We ensure these service providers agree to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Statement. For example, we use Shopify Payments to process payments for us, and we may share payment method information (such as credit or debit card number or bank account information), purchase amount, date of purchase, name, email, billing or shipping address, and in some cases your transaction history to authenticate you. We use Google Analytics to monitor and report on the use of our website, and we use Google Firebase to manage the sign-in process of our apps and website. We encourage you to review our service providers’ privacy practices here:
Shopify Payments Privacy Policy
Google Analytics’ Privacy Policy
Google Firebase Privacy Policy
Amazon Web Services Privacy Notice
Zendesk Privacy Policy
For legal disclosure. We may share your information with third parties when we reasonably believe disclosure is required or permitted in order to comply with a subpoena, court order or other applicable law, regulation or legal process.
We do not disclose any personal information such as phone numbers or SMS consent with any 3rd parties for any purposes.
To protect us or others. We may share your information if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our products or services, our customers, or others.
As aggregate information. We may share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information internally or with others for purposes of research, reporting, and benchmarking.
As a result of merger or sale of our business. We may share your personal information if we are involved in a merger, sale, financing, liquidation, bankruptcy or acquisition of corporate entities or business units.
We do not sell your personal information for any reason. Period.
Where we store your personal information and how we keep it safe:
Storage and location
We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store our data and provide us with services. All AWS services used are currently located in the “US East” availability zone, but we may use other availability zones in the future if it helps achieve our core purpose: enabling you to access the data produced by your WeatherFlow product(s).
If you access or use our services from the European Union or other regions of the world with data protection laws that differ from United States law, then you acknowledge and consent to the transfer of your personal to the United States so we can provide the services and perform our obligations to you under our Terms of Use, and for any other purpose for which you provide explicit, informed consent.
We may transfer personal information we have collected about you to a third-party data processor located in countries outside of the European Union, in accordance with and as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. When providing information about you to entities outside the EU, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that those entities protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
Security
Wherever your personal information is stored, we take reasonable steps to ensure that it is protected against unauthorized access, modification, use, or disclosure. Your email address, for example, is stored in a secure manner that requires authentication to access.
Exercising your privacy rights
You have some important privacy rights and we’re committed to making sure you can exercise them easily. This is part of our focus on being ethical, simple, and good to your data.
If you access the services while physically located in the European Economic Area, you may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which include the rights to:
Get a copy of your personal information.
You have the right to request a copy of your personal information.
Correct or delete your personal information.
If you think any of the personal information we hold about you is wrong, you can ask us to correct it. You can also ask us to delete it. If we can’t correct or delete your information (for example, where we don’t agree that it’s wrong, or we need the information for a lawful purpose), we’ll tell you why. You can ask us to attach your correction request to the information as a statement of correction.
Manage how we use your personal information.
If we are processing your personal information on the basis of consent, you can revoke your consent at any time. If we are processing your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests (such as improving our products and services), including automated processing, you can object to this. If you believe we are using your personal information in ways that are unlawful, or if we are continuing to use information that you think is inaccurate, you can ask us to restrict this processing.
Request transfer of your personal information to a third party.
You can ask us to make your data portable so that you can transfer it to a third party.
You may request to exercise any of the rights above by contacting us by:
Using our
web contact form
Emailing us at support@tempest.earth
We may ask you to provide information to verify your identity and right to access the information in your request.
Public Sharing Settings
You have the option to share some of the weather data with the public. Specifically, each Tempest product has a “share publicly” setting. When this setting is activated, your Tempest product’s name and location are visible to the public via our website and via our API. You may deactivate this setting at any time, making your Tempest product completely private. That is, when this setting is disabled, your Tempest product is completely invisible to anyone who is not authenticated against your account.
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are stored in a web browser’s memory. Cookies help us remember your preferences and that you have already logged in, and they help us analyze how you use our website and services so we can improve your experience and offer an effective and safe website. We update our cookies periodically, but we generally use cookies for the following purposes:
To operate the services: we use cookies for functions such as authentication, fraud prevention and detection, and site features and preferences.
To analyze and improve the services: we use cookies to understand how you use the website and services, such as which pages you visit or which URLs referred you.
How You Can Manage Cookies
Your web browser may allow you to control the cookies we and other websites set on your computer. Please consult the help section of your web browser for more information on how to delete cookies. However, note that if you choose to delete or disable cookies, we may be unable to provide the services to you, or they may not function optimally.
Do Not Track
As part of our commitment to transparency and protecting your privacy, we recognize and respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.
Third Party Links
We may provide content to you that links to third-party websites. For example, we post links to our social media profiles so you can find us easily on other platforms. We do not control, and are not responsible for, third parties’ privacy practices and content. When you click on a link to a third-party site, the third party may collect your personal information, which will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy. Please read the third party’s privacy policy to learn about how they collect and process your personal information.
Complaints and Disputes
If you have any concerns about the way we have collected or processed your personal information, we want to hear from you. You might simply want to understand why we have used or shared your information in a certain way. We want you to tell us about your concerns so we can resolve them for you and also learn from them. If we cannot resolve your concerns, you may also have a right to make a complaint to your local data protection authority (DPA). A list of DPAs is available

Shopify shall be fully liable for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors to the same extent Shopify would be liable if performing the services of each Subprocessor directly under the terms of this DPA. Shopify’s liability will nevertheless be subject to the conditions and limitation of liability set forth in the Terms.
5. Assistance to the Controller
Taking into account the nature of Your Personal Data and related processing, Shopify shall provide such reasonable assistance as You may reasonably request to assist You in complying with Your obligations:
to respond to Data Rights Requests under European Data Protection Laws;
to notify relevant authorities and/or data subjects of a Personal Data Breach;
to conduct data protection impact assessments and prior consultations;
to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with section 3.
6. Assessing compliance
a)
Shopify may fulfill Your right of audit under European Data Protection Laws in relation to the processing of personal data by providing You - upon Your written request and subject to confidentiality - with:
(i) Shopify's most recent audit report results, either from Shopify's self-audits or prepared by an independent third party auditor;
(ii) additional information in Shopify's control if a data protection or governmental authority requests it.
b)
Provided that and only to the extent that European Data Protection Laws grant You this right, You may exercise Your Audit right: (i) to the extent that an independent internationally recognized auditor attests that Shopify's provision of an audit report does not provide sufficient information for You to verify Shopify's compliance with this DPA and with European Data Protection Laws or (ii) as necessary for You to respond to a government authority audit. Each audit must conform to the following parameters: (i) be conducted by an independent third party that will enter into a confidentiality agreement with Shopify; (ii) be limited in scope to matters reasonably required, and as mutually agreed upon, for You to assess Shopify's compliance with this DPA and the parties’ compliance with European Data Protection Laws; (iii) occur at a mutually agreed date and time and only during Shopify's regular business hours; (iv) occur no more than once annually (unless required under European Data Protection Laws); (v) cover only facilities controlled by Shopify; (vi) restrict findings to Personal Data only; and (vii) treat any results as confidential information to the fullest extent permitted by European Data Protection Laws. For clarification, Shopify will comply with any of Your rights under this section 6 in accordance with its confidentiality obligations with third parties.
7. End of processing
a)
During Your use of the Services, You may leverage account tools to access, return to yourself, or delete Personal Data.
b)
Following termination, Shopify will, at Your choice, delete or return Your Personal Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shopify may retain Personal Data: (i) as required by law, including European Data Protection Laws; and (ii) in accordance with its standard backup or record retention policies, provided that, in either case, Shopify will maintain the confidentiality of, and otherwise comply with the applicable provisions of this DPA with respect to, retained Personal Data, and not further Process retained Personal Data except for such purpose(s) and duration permitted under such applicable laws.
8. International Transfers
a)
Subject to compliance with European Data Protection Laws, Shopify International Ltd. may transfer Personal Data processed under this Appendix outside of the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland as necessary to provide its Services (“International Transfers”).
b)
Such transfers consist primarily in transferring Personal Data to Shopify Inc., based in Canada which benefits from a decision of the EU Commission 2002/2/EC dated December 20, 2001 on the adequate protection of personal data provided by the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.
c)
Any International Transfers to countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of the European Data Protection Laws, will be subject to appropriate safeguards including the following transfer mechanisms:
the relevant modules under the 2021 Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission in its decision 2021/914/EC dated June 4, 2021;
the International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international data transfers issued by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office under S119A(1) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018;
the 2021 Standard Contractual Clauses as amended to satisfy the requirements of the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (as amended from time to time) of June 19, 1992 as revised as of September 25, 2001; and
any standard contractual clauses, international data transfer addendum or other clauses, addenda or transfer mechanisms that might replace the current clauses and addendum.
d)
Shopify may, in its sole discretion, replace any transfer mechanism to ensure that data transfers comply with applicable laws. If a transfer is based on standard contractual clauses and such clauses are updated by the relevant authorities, such updated clauses or similar agreements will be incorporated into this DPA as if fully stated herein.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO

certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Firebase Authentication
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Cloud Functions for Firebase
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase Realtime Database
Cloud Storage for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Firebase Test Lab
Firebase App Check
Firebase App Distribution
Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data
Firebase Service Data is personal information that Google collects and generates
during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.
Examples of Firebase Service Data include information about service usage,
