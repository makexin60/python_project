We use the personal data that we collect from and about you only for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect your information.
Laws in certain locations where we operate require that we disclose our legal basis for processing your personal data, which includes the following bases depending on which service you use:
Contract
– we require certain personal data to provide and support the Services you purchase or request from us

Vital Interests
– there may be circumstances where we will process your information to protect your vital interests or those of another person
If we rely on our (or a third party’s) legitimate interests to collect and use your personal data, these interests will normally be to operate and provide our Services, communicate with you and respond to your questions, improve our Services or use the insights to improve or develop new services, market or promote either our Services or the services of a third-party that are closely partnered with our Services, or to detect or prevent illegal activities.
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services).

Cookies
”) to operate and enhance our Websites and certain Services and understand how you navigate our Websites and Services, to maintain user preferences or settings, combat fraud, help to ensure compliance with our policies and Terms of Use, and support our online advertising (including retargeting efforts) for Viasat services.  Where required by applicable law, we ask you to provide your consent to or give you choices on the use of these tracking technologies.

How we secure your personal data
Viasat takes the security of your personal data seriously. The measures we use to protect your information may vary between Websites and the Services.
We take our responsibility to protect your information seriously and use appropriate technical, physical, and organizational measures to safeguard the information that we process through our Websites and Services. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data. No security system is 100% secure, however, and we cannot guarantee our security measures will not be compromised.;
International data transfers
We operate as a global organization with service providers and partners around the world. Your personal data may be transferred to countries with data protection standards that are not equal to the standards in the country where you are located. We put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your personal data when transferring it around the world.
Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you reside.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
The servers that operate or process personal data related to our Services are primarily located in the United States and the UK, though personal data also may be transferred to India, Israel, Ireland, and the group countries in which our business is established or our Services are available, and potentially other countries. Our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal data, we or our service providers may process it in any of these countries. Please see under the heading "
When We Share Your Personal Data
" above for further information on third parties we may share your personal data with and in which countries they are located.
We take appropriate safeguards to help ensure that your personal data remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include, for example, implementing the UK and European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal data they process from the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the UK in accordance with data protection laws in those areas. Where appropriate, we also put in place additional safeguards to protect your personal data when it is transferred to countries considered to be less protective.
Information on the Standard Contractual Clauses we have in place between our Viasat group companies can be provided on request.  We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners.
We may also use the Data Privacy Framework for certain transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Switzerland to the United States. Please see our
Data Privacy Framework Notice
for more information.

When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Automated decision-making
We do not use your personal data to engage in automated decision-making that will have a significant effect on you (legally or otherwise).  In the U.S., we use automated tools that process information such as your location and credit history to assess whether our Services are an available or most appropriate service option for you and to inform the appropriate initial upfront fee for our Services.

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights that you can exercise over our collection and use of your personal data.
