Privacy Policy
Second Nature Healthy Habits Ltd, trading under the name Second Nature, ("we") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We are registered with the UK Information Commissioner's Office as a Data Controller (Reg No. ZA148098), and have in place a comprehensive Company data protection policy and code of practice.
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") (together with our Terms, which can be accessed at https://www.secondnature.io/terms, and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us and how you can get access to this information. If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (UK), “personal information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Please review it carefully.
1. Purpose of this Policy
Second Nature provides you (the "User") with access to the online and mobile services including but not limited to, secondnature.io and all associated subdomains (the "Website"), the Second Nature mobile application (the "App"), and any provided healthcare tracking technology, collectively the "System". Our privacy policy is designed in accordance with numerous national and international regulation frameworks, including (but not limited to) the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”).
2. What personal information do we hold and how we get it
We may collect and process personal information provided by filling in forms on the Website or App, including personal information provided during completion of surveys and other online tools, posting of comments in the Community or requesting further services, and when you report a problem with our System. If you contact us, we may also keep a record of that correspondence. Second Nature also collects and processes personal information with the health tracking technology provided as part of the System, such as wireless weighing scales (which track your weight) and activity trackers (which track your steps and sleep).
Throughout your use of the System we may collect personal information such as: personal demographics information (including but not limited to first and last names, date of birth or age, address, email, phone number); lifestyle or health data (referred as “special category data” and includes height, weight, body mass index, ethnicity, smoking status, allergies, past and present health conditions, and any medication you take); other personal health profile information and details of your visits to the System and the resources that you access (including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs, other communication data, and the resources that you access).
Your personal information (steps per day and weight) may also be collected via Apple
        HealthKit or Google Fit upon installing our iOS and Android apps. This
        consent will be explained and obtained from you within the app and you
        may revoke this access at any point within your phone's operating system
        settings.
Your personal information, including your health data (referred as “special category data” and includes height, weight, HBA1C level, BP level, cholesterol level, PAM score) may also be provided to us by an electronic patient record, referral or through a secure online platform in order to refer you to the System, e.g. provided through your GP, local NHS service or our partner REED. If this is the case, the relevant party will ask for your explicit consent .
We collect technical information and analytics from you concerning your use of the System, including but not limited to pages visited, links clicked, non-sensitive text entered, mouse movements, system and operating system type and version, browser or app version, time zone setting and usage of our iPhone and Android apps.
3. IP addresses and cookies
We may collect personal information about your device, including where available your IP address, operating system, browser type and screen size for use in system administration, to tailor your experience of the System, provide you with customer support and to report aggregate information internally.
For the same reason, we may obtain personal information about your usage of the System by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your device. Cookies help us to give you a smooth user experience, improve the System and deliver a better and more personalized service. They enable us to: recognize you when you return to our site; maintain personal information you have entered (e.g. during completion of a survey); speed up your searches; estimate our audience size and usage pattern; store information about your preferences; and allow us to customize our site according to your individual interests.
Both Second Nature and our third-party vendors, including Google, may
        use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) to inform,
        optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Website on
        sites across the Internet (also known as 'remarketing'). If you would
        like to opt out of this you can do so via your Google Ads Preferences
        Manager.
Below is an overview of the types of cookies we and third parties may use to collect information.
—
Strictly necessary cookies.
Some cookies are strictly necessary to make the services available to you. We cannot provide you with the services without this type of cookies.

We may use our own analytics cookies or use third party analytics providers such as Facebook, FOSPHA, HotJar, Metabase, Mixpanel, Twitter, Taboola and VWO to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf. These providers may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources.
Where required by applicable law, we obtain your consent to use cookies.
You may refuse to accept cookies by changing the settings on your device to prevent cookies from being set. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the System. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you visit the Website and App.
4. How we use your personal information

6. Where we store your personal information
All personal information you provide to us is stored on secure servers with trusted 3rd party suppliers, Amazon Web Services ('AWS') within the European Economic Area ('EEA').

Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures to try to prevent unauthorized access in accordance with our Company data protection policy and code of practice, and responsibilities as a registered Data Controller in the UK.

10. Children's Privacy

If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at support@secondnature.io.
11. Data Storage and Protection
Your data is protected by Second Nature and its processors in pursuance to all legal requirements set by the relevant data processing laws. Second Nature has taken technical and organizational security measures to protect your data and requires its data processors to meet the same requirements. Second Nature has signed processing agreements with its processors to ensure an adequate level of data protection.
The following security measures are taken by Second Nature to protect your personal data in the course of the listed business processes:
Staff
Second Nature staff members are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with Second Nature
'
s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. All staff members undergo appropriate background checks prior to hiring and sign a confidentiality agreement outlining their responsibility in protecting customer data.
We continuously train staff members on best security practices, including how to identify social hacks, phishing scams, and hackers.
Access controls
Second Nature maintains your data privacy by allowing only authorized individuals access to information when it is critical to complete tasks for you. Second Nature staff members will not process customer data without authorization.
Data hosting
As a rule, data is hosted within countries and areas that provide a substantially similar level of protection as data subjects have under the GDPR. To ensure this, we rely on Adequacy Decisions as a legal basis for our international data transfers. In exceptional circumstances, where data is transferred to a country or area not subject to an Adequacy Decision, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses with the recipient and take supplementary security measures to secure this data transfer, such as anonymisation.
Physical security
The data centres on which personal data is hosted are secured and monitored 24/7 and physical access to facilities is strictly limited to select staff.
Technical security measures
All devices which are used to access personal data for which we are responsible are secured with antivirus software, firewalls, encryption and access management. We regularly update operating systems and software to ensure vulnerabilities cannot be exploited.
We carry out regular vulnerability scanning of our website and have engaged credentialed external auditors to verify the adequacy of our security and privacy measures.
