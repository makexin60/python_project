Usage
The App is
not
using any user tracking or analytics scripts or tools.
Nobody
has access to what cryptocurrencies you follow, what exchanges you use, what news you read or any other behavior inside the app.
Alerts
Alerts are stored on a server to deliver notifications reliably and with minimum latency. They are stored as a combination of push token and price formula. Push token is a long string of characters provided by Apple to send notifications to your device. The token is completely anonymous and doesn’t reveal anything about your device or identity.
API Keys
App uses Apple’s framework called
Keychain Services
to store your exchange API keys on your device. It is the same technology, with the same grade of security as what Apple uses for their secure credential storage.
