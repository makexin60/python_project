Information on how to manage cookies and related technologies within your browser and more generally can be found below along with a more detailed description of how we use these technologies.
A “cookie” is a small text file placed and saved in your browser when you access our Websites and potentially the websites of our Merchants, business partners and other third parties. We use both session cookies (i.e., cookies that are stored only for a specific website visit) and persistent cookies (i.e., cookies that are stored beyond a specific website visit) to provide the Services and for the purposes described in this Statement. These cookies may be set by us (first-party cookies) or set by third parties that collect information on our behalf (third-party cookies), such as Google Analytics.
There are other tracking technologies, such as web beacons/GIFs, pixels, page tags, embedded scripts, that consist of small transparent image files or other web programming code that record how you interact with websites, mobile applications and services.  They are often used in conjunction with web browser cookies or other identifiers associated with your device.
We also use pixels and related technologies as part of session replay services on certain Websites that are used to understand and improve functionality and an individual’s experience on those sites.
In certain instances, Toast may provide our Merchants with digital advertising and related services that involve the collection and use of cookies, pixels and related technologies via integrations.  In these cases, Merchants set up independent accounts with these third parties.
There are ways to control and/or reject the setting of cookies and similar technologies within your browser settings. As each browser is different, please consult the “help” menu within your browser.  For additional information about cookies and how to control their use on various browsers and devices, you can visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. Please be aware that depending on the Services being used, restricting cookies may prevent you from accessing and using all or part of the Services.
Targeted advertising and your choices
In certain cases, we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on our Websites, mobile applications and within our Services to collect information about you and your activities for interest-based advertising or other targeted content.  The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. This information may be shared with ad networks and other content providers.
If you want to opt out of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser, please visit  and follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices, or
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
to place an opt-out cookie on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.  Opt-out cookies only work on the specific internet browser and device that they are downloaded onto.

If you delete cookies on your device generally, you will need to set the opt-out cookie again on that device. If you want to opt out of receiving online interest-based advertisements on mobile applications, please follow the instructions at
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
or by visiting the settings in your mobile device.
Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online services.  It means that the online ads that you do see should not be tailored to your interests.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention purposes.
Do not track
We may use, and we may allow third-party service providers and other third parties to use, cookies or other technologies on our Services that collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Services.

Managing your information
We want to ensure that you have the necessary tools at your disposal to manage your personal information.

this page

In other instances, if applicable, see the instructions provided as part of the Services or contact us as described in the “How to contact us” section of this Statement. We may need to verify your identity before changing or correcting your information. In certain instances, we may not be able to make the correction or accommodate the request due to legal, contractual or technical restrictions.
Please note that depending on your status, location and applicable law, you may be entitled to additional information rights in relation to the processing of your personal information. For more information regarding these rights, and the locations/circumstances where these rights are available, please see the applicable addendums in this Statement.
Managing communications
As part of providing the Services, Toast (whether directly or through a third-party service provider), may send you:
Marketing communications: Depending on the nature of our relationship and the Services being used, we may send you marketing and other promotional communications for new or existing Services that we think you might be interested in.

You can opt out of or unsubscribe from any marketing communications by following the instructions in those messages, by changing your communications preferences within your account or through your device. You can also opt out by contacting us at

These messages may include transaction-specific communications, messages as part of a loyalty program or account-specific communications. If you are located outside the United States, we will not send you direct marketing communications without your opt-in consent or as otherwise permitted under the applicable law.
In certain cases, our Merchants (including those within a Merchant’s management group) may also send you marketing and promotional communications as part of the Services, including when you visit a Merchant using Toast or join a Merchant-specific loyalty program.

For Guests:

9. Security
We implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical security measures to reasonably protect your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, damage or loss.

10. Links to other websites
This Privacy Statement only applies to information collected when visiting our Websites or otherwise using our Services. While visiting our Websites or using the Services, you may be directed through links to third-party websites or services that are not operated or controlled by us. For example, the websites of our Merchants or business partners that provide services as part of this Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of these third parties. As a result, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites as their practices may differ from ours.
11. Children
Our Services are not targeted or directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us as described in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Statement to request that we remove the information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collected has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal information.
We do, however, process personal information about children when it is necessary for the services we are offering, and you provide it to us. For example, if you are a Merchant Employee, we may collect information relating to children if your employer is using the Toast Payroll and Team Management module and you add them as dependents under your benefits policies.

You can obtain more information about this balancing test by using the contact details at the end of this Addendum.
Where we collect personal information to administer our contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations, this is mandatory and we will not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you or otherwise provide the Services without this information.

International transfers
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement to countries that have not been found to provide an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission.
In particular, we may transfer your personal information to third parties, including to parties located in the United States. We use appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information to third party service providers.  Where required, we have implemented the EU/EEA approved standard contractual clauses, rely on a service provider’s processor binding corporate rules or have implemented/rely on other legally recognized safeguards for data transfer purposes.
We also use appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information among our affiliates in the United States. We have implemented the EU/EEA approved standard contractual clauses or have implemented/rely on other legally recognized safeguards for data transfer purposes.

request access to and obtain a copy of your personal information;
request the transfer of your personal information you have provided to us to you or another company in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
request rectification of your personal information when it is inaccurate or incomplete;
request erasure of your personal information where permitted under the applicable law, such as where the information is no longer necessary or lawful for us to store or where your information is outdated;

withdraw your consent at any time where this is the legal basis on which we are processing your personal information. If you ask to withdraw your consent, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place at that time.

Your rights will in each case be subject to the restrictions set out in applicable data protection laws.
You may exercise these rights free of charge by submitting your request
here
or to
privacy@toasttab.com
.  Subject to the applicable law, Toast may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on a request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character. In some situations, Toast may refuse to act or impose limitations on the information disclosed if, for instance, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of your personal information with the Irish Data Protection Commission.
Retention
We will retain your personal information for only as long as needed for the purpose of the processing activity or where we have a legitimate business need to retain it, subject to our legal and regulatory obligations to retain it longer and our applicable records retention periods. The duration of these periods will vary depending on your relationship with Toast and the Service you are using. For example,
Merchants: Merchant account and ownership information will generally be maintained for seven (7) years following the termination of the relationship absent a legal or regulatory obligation to retain longer;
Merchant Employees: Merchant employee information will generally be maintained for seven (7) years following the termination of the relationship with the Merchant unless removed sooner by the Merchant; and
Guests: Digital ordering accounts created by our Guests will be maintained for the duration of their use of the service and removed following five (5) years of inactivity. Transactional information and other Guest information held by our Merchants as part of their operations will be retained for the duration of our relationship with the Merchant plus a period of seven (7) years.
Other periods are set out within Toast’s records retention policy and schedule. Our retention periods are also subject to any rights of individuals or other requirements that might dictate a shorter retention period (e.g., deletion requests). In certain cases, Toast may also maintain information for a longer period of time, such as in cases where the information is subject to a legal claim or complaint. Following those periods and other determinations on the duration of the processing of personal information by Toast, we will delete or take measures to anonymize your personal information.
Cookies and other technologies
In addition to the information found in the section of the main body of the Statement titled “Cookies and other tracking technologies”, Toast’s Cookie Policy can be found

Toast UK and Toast US also act as processors on behalf of Merchants as to certain Services provided to Guests as well as our Merchants Employees in connection with certain aspects of our Services.  The Merchant is the data controller in respect of this relationship.

You can obtain more information about this balancing test by using the contact details at the end of this Addendum.
Where we collect personal information to administer our contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations, this is mandatory and we will not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you or otherwise provide the Services without this information. In all other cases, provision of the requested personal information is optional, but this may affect your ability to use our Services or our websites.
International transfers
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement to countries that have not been found to provide an adequate level of data protection by UK Data Protection Law.
In particular, we may transfer your personal information to third parties, including to parties located in the United States. We use appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information to third party service providers.  Where required, we have implemented the UK approved standard contractual clauses or the UK approved addendum to the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses, rely on a service provider’s processor binding corporate rules or have implemented/rely on other legally recognized safeguards for data transfer purposes.

Choice and access
You have additional rights regarding how your personal information is processed, including the right to:
request access to and obtain a copy of your personal information;
request the transfer of your personal information you have provided to us to you or another company in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
request rectification of your personal information when it is inaccurate or incomplete;

Your rights will in each case be subject to the restrictions set out in UK Data Protection Law.
You may exercise these rights free of charge by submitting your request
here
or to
privacy@toasttab.com
.  Subject to the applicable law, Toast may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on a request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character. In some situations, Toast may refuse to act or impose limitations on the information disclosed if, for instance, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of your personal information with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office.
Retention
We will retain your personal information for only as long as needed for the purpose of the processing activity or where we have a legitimate business need to retain it, subject to our legal and regulatory obligations to retain it longer and our applicable records retention periods. The duration of these periods will vary depending on your relationship with Toast and the Service you are using. For example,
Merchants: Merchant account and ownership information will generally be maintained for seven (7) years following the termination of the relationship absent a legal or regulatory obligation to retain longer;
Merchant Employees: Merchant employee information will generally be maintained for seven (7) years following the termination of the relationship with the Merchant unless removed sooner by the Merchant; and
Guests: Digital ordering accounts created by our Guests will be maintained for the duration of their use of the service and removed following five (5) years of inactivity. Transactional information and other Guest information held by our Merchants as part of their operations will be retained for the duration of our relationship with the Merchant plus a period of seven (7) years.
Other periods are set out within Toast’s records retention policy and schedule. Our retention periods are also subject to any rights of individuals or other requirements that might dictate a shorter retention period (e.g., deletion requests). In certain cases, Toast may also maintain information for a longer period of time, such as in cases where the information is subject to a legal claim or complaint. Following those periods and other determinations on the duration of the processing of personal information by Toast, we will delete or take measures to anonymize your personal information.

Depending on the nature of your relationship with Toast, we may provide you with the capability to manage your personal information directly as part of the Services or by contacting Toast.
Managing your information
We want to ensure that you have the necessary tools at your disposal to manage your personal information. We rely on you to ensure that your information is accurate, complete and up to date and ask that you notify us of any changes to your personal information. Your ability to update and manage your personal information will differ depending on your relationship with Toast and what Services you use. For example,
As a Merchant, for certain services, you may access, change or correct certain account information at any time by logging into your account. In other instances, please contact our customer success team.
As a Merchant Employee using the Toast Payroll and Team Management module or other Merchant Employee-facing Services, you have the ability in many cases to access and update your information through the Services. In other instances, please reach out to your Merchant Employer.
As a Guest, depending on the Services you use, you may be able to access, change and update your information through an account created as part of the Services (e.g., a Digital Ordering Account). If you are a Guest and have questions about your Digital Ordering Account or need customer support, please contact
support@toasttakeout.zendesk.com
and/or review the information on
this page
. In certain cases (e.g., Local by Toast), you can also submit a request for deletion of your Digital Ordering Account from directly within the mobile application.
In other instances, if applicable, see the instructions provided as part of the Services or contact us as described in the “How to contact us” section of this Statement. We may need to verify your identity before changing or correcting your information. In certain instances, we may not be able to make the correction or accommodate the request due to legal, contractual or technical restrictions.
Please note that depending on your status, location and applicable law, you may be entitled to additional information rights in relation to the processing of your personal information. For more information regarding these rights, and the locations/circumstances where these rights are available, please see the applicable addendums in this Statement.
Managing communications
As part of providing the Services, Toast (whether directly or through a third-party service provider), may send you:
Marketing communications: Depending on the nature of our relationship and the Services being used, we may send you marketing and other promotional communications for new or existing Services that we think you might be interested in. These marketing communications may include marketing text messages if you have opted in to receiving them. You can opt out of or unsubscribe from any marketing communications by following the instructions in those messages, by changing your communications preferences within your account or through your device. You can also opt out by contacting us at
privacy@toasttab.com
. Opting out of one communication will not necessarily opt you out of all marketing communications.  Please note that you may still receive certain non-marketing communications after opting out. These messages may include transaction-specific communications, messages as part of a loyalty program or account-specific communications. If you are located outside the United States, we will not send you direct marketing communications without your opt-in consent or as otherwise permitted under the applicable law.
In certain cases, our Merchants (including those within a Merchant’s management group) may also send you marketing and promotional communications as part of the Services, including when you visit a Merchant using Toast or join a Merchant-specific loyalty program. In these instances, please follow the instructions within those messages to opt out or reach out to the Merchant directly.
Other communications: As part of your interaction with our Services, you may receive various non-marketing communications from Toast that may be sent via email or text message. These include:
For Guests:
sending you digital receipts or other messages in relation to Services you engage with;
notifications sent by Merchants, our business partners and/or third-party service providers as part of our Services, such as order status, delivery or pick up notifications and information pertaining to our reservation and waitlist services;

account or program-specific messages as part of your use of the Services (e.g., loyalty accounts with our Merchants or by setting up a Digital Ordering Account); or

9. Security
We implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical security measures to reasonably protect your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, damage or loss. However, even though we have taken measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that the collection, transmission and storage of personal information will always be completely secure.
10. Links to other websites
This Privacy Statement only applies to information collected when visiting our Websites or otherwise using our Services. While visiting our Websites or using the Services, you may be directed through links to third-party websites or services that are not operated or controlled by us. For example, the websites of our Merchants or business partners that provide services as part of this Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of these third parties. As a result, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites as their practices may differ from ours.
11. Children
Our Services are not targeted or directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us as described in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Statement to request that we remove the information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collected has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal information.
We do, however, process personal information about children when it is necessary for the services we are offering, and you provide it to us. For example, if you are a Merchant Employee, we may collect information relating to children if your employer is using the Toast Payroll and Team Management module and you add them as dependents under your benefits policies.

Necessary for our legitimate interest in complying with laws, protecting our network and systems, our business and others and establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights
Necessary for compliance with our legal obligations under Irish law where required by Irish law or, where not required by Irish law, necessary for our legitimate interest in effective compliance management
Where we process personal information on the basis of a legitimate interest (as identified above), as required by data protection law, we have carried out a balancing test to document our interests, to consider what the impact of the processing will be on individuals and to determine whether individuals’ interests outweigh our interests in the processing taking place. You can obtain more information about this balancing test by using the contact details at the end of this Addendum.
Where we collect personal information to administer our contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations, this is mandatory and we will not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you or otherwise provide the Services without this information. In all other cases, provision of the requested personal information is optional, but this may affect your ability to use our Services or our websites.
International transfers
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement to countries that have not been found to provide an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission.
In particular, we may transfer your personal information to third parties, including to parties located in the United States. We use appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information to third party service providers.  Where required, we have implemented the EU/EEA approved standard contractual clauses, rely on a service provider’s processor binding corporate rules or have implemented/rely on other legally recognized safeguards for data transfer purposes.
We also use appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information among our affiliates in the United States. We have implemented the EU/EEA approved standard contractual clauses or have implemented/rely on other legally recognized safeguards for data transfer purposes.
To obtain a copy of the standard contractual clauses or other transfer safeguards, please send a request to
privacy@toasttab.com
.
Choice and access
You have additional rights regarding how your personal information is processed, including the right to:
request access to and obtain a copy of your personal information;
request the transfer of your personal information you have provided to us to you or another company in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
request rectification of your personal information when it is inaccurate or incomplete;
request erasure of your personal information where permitted under the applicable law, such as where the information is no longer necessary or lawful for us to store or where your information is outdated;
restrict or object to the processing of your personal information (as applicable), including to object to the processing of personal information for direct marketing purposes; and
withdraw your consent at any time where this is the legal basis on which we are processing your personal information. If you ask to withdraw your consent, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place at that time.
Please note that if you choose to withdraw your consent, you may not be able to participate in or benefit from the programs, services and initiatives for which you provided consent to the processing of your personal information. Your rights will in each case be subject to the restrictions set out in applicable data protection laws.
You may exercise these rights free of charge by submitting your request
here
or to
privacy@toasttab.com
.  Subject to the applicable law, Toast may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on a request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character. In some situations, Toast may refuse to act or impose limitations on the information disclosed if, for instance, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of your personal information with the Irish Data Protection Commission.
Retention
We will retain your personal information for only as long as needed for the purpose of the processing activity or where we have a legitimate business need to retain it, subject to our legal and regulatory obligations to retain it longer and our applicable records retention periods. The duration of these periods will vary depending on your relationship with Toast and the Service you are using. For example,
Merchants: Merchant account and ownership information will generally be maintained for seven (7) years following the termination of the relationship absent a legal or regulatory obligation to retain longer;
Merchant Employees: Merchant employee information will generally be maintained for seven (7) years following the termination of the relationship with the Merchant unless removed sooner by the Merchant; and
Guests: Digital ordering accounts created by our Guests will be maintained for the duration of their use of the service and removed following five (5) years of inactivity. Transactional information and other Guest information held by our Merchants as part of their operations will be retained for the duration of our relationship with the Merchant plus a period of seven (7) years.
Other periods are set out within Toast’s records retention policy and schedule. Our retention periods are also subject to any rights of individuals or other requirements that might dictate a shorter retention period (e.g., deletion requests). In certain cases, Toast may also maintain information for a longer period of time, such as in cases where the information is subject to a legal claim or complaint. Following those periods and other determinations on the duration of the processing of personal information by Toast, we will delete or take measures to anonymize your personal information.
Cookies and other technologies
In addition to the information found in the section of the main body of the Statement titled “Cookies and other tracking technologies”, Toast’s Cookie Policy can be found

and provides some supplemental information for users in the EU/EEA and UK.
Children
Our Services are not targeted or directed at children under the age of 16, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us as described in the “How to contact us” section within main body of the Privacy Statement to request that we remove the information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collected has been provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete that personal information.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
