3. Lead's Personal Data Processing: Sales and Marketing
Who is the Data Controller?
When we conduct our email marketing campaigns and outbound sales development activities (email and calling), as described in this chapter, the following Aircall companies typically participate in them and act as
Joint Controllers
By “Joint Controllers” we mean those Aircall companies that jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing of your personal data and thus are generally jointly responsible, under the data protection laws, for the legality of the usage of your personal data.
: Aircall SAS, Aircall UK Ltd,
Aircall.io
, Inc. and Aircall PTY LTD.
Our email communication will always include identification of Aircall company leading our marketing activity in your region (Aircall SAS in Europe, Middle East, and Asia;
Aircall.io
, Inc. in North America; and Aircall PTY LTD in Australia). Other Aircall companies may participate, based on internal agreement between them, in the processing of your Personal Data within our email marketing campaigns and outbound sales development activities as follows:
Aircall companies participate in creation of the email communication content and design;
Aircall companies share the touchpoint for requests and complaints regarding the processing of your Personal Data in relation to Aircall's outbound sales development and marketing activities, whereby your requests and complaints are typically handled by Aircall SAS;
Aircall companies jointly administer and share database used for Aircall's outbound sales development and marketing purposes; and
Each Aircall company may enter into agreement with Aircall's business partners to enrich the shared database.
How do we collect your Personal Data?
If we contact you with an email marketing campaign and/or as a part of our outbound sales development activities, it means we have your contact details listed in our database for these purposes. We collect contact details for our database from the following sources:
Aircall's internal customer database: If you are Aircall's customer, we automatically add you to our database for email marketing communication, as we believe that you are interested in news about Aircall product, services, events and other content.
Forms on Aircall Site: You have the option to sign up for our email marketing campaigns and outbound sales development activities via various forms on Aircall Site, including when you register for a webinar or event hosted by Aircall or where Aircall participates, and via support chat bot on the Site.
Social networks: We may find your contact on a work-related social network, such as LinkedIn.
Campaigns co-organized by Aircall: We also receive your contact when you participate in a marketing campaign co-organized by Aircall and its business partners.
Data-enrichment tools and providers: Where local data protection laws allow and where we find a reliable data-enrichment tool provider, we may also receive some of your contact details. Every provider used by Aircall for this purpose is subject to Aircall's privacy team assessment to make sure we collect your data ethically and in compliance with applicable laws.
What should you do if you want us to stop contacting you as a Lead?
You can find an "Unsubscribe" link in every email marketing communication sent by Aircall. Using this link is a reliable way to make sure we do not contact you with marketing emails anymore. Please note that it may take us up to 3 working days to process your "Unsubscribe" choice, so you may receive other marketing emails from us in the meantime. Thank you for understanding.
If we call you as a part of Aircall's outbound sales development activities, you can inform our outbound sales representative that you do not wish to be contacted in this way anymore at any time. We will make sure not to call you again.
Which Personal Data do we use?
When we process your data as a Lead, we use, all or just some, depending on your particular circumstance, of the following Personal Data: name, email, phone number, company and job title, region/country, and/or IP address. We also use certain data about your company, such as company size, CRM, and whether you or your company is an Aircall Customer.

Only our personnel, the services in charge of control (especially external auditors) and our recipient subcontractors may have access to your Personal Data.
Personal Data may also be disclosed in response to lawful requests made by government agencies or public authorities —including public officers or debt collection organizations— to meet national security, law enforcement, or any other legal requirements.
Depending on where you are located, we might have to enforce local regulations and requirements where the use of a local phone number requires verification of customer's identity and collection and storage of user details (in particular, first/last name and address) in the event we should receive an official request from a competent local authority.
6. Retention of Personal Data
We retain Personal Data when we have an ongoing legal basis to do so. When we no longer have legal basis to process Personal Data, we will either delete or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
We may retain Personal Data to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations. In any case, upon ceasing or lifting of such obligations, Personal Data shall be removed from our systems and records, as well as that of our subcontractors, if any, or otherwise archived or anonymized so that they can no longer be identified.
7. Transfers of Personal Data outside of the country of origin
Aircall may transfer Personal Data to recipients (described in Section 5 above) located outside of the country of the Personal Data’s origin.
Personal Data can also be processed by mere access by individuals working outside the country of origin who work for us or for one of our trusted service providers (Data Processors).
The main locations where the Personal Data may be stored are the United States, Europe (European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom; collectively, “Europe”) and Australia. They also may be transferred to, mainly but not limited to, these countries as well as to India.
We have implemented suitable safeguards designed to transfer Personal Data outside countries of origin in a secure manner and in compliance with the applicable regulations, most significantly with the GDPR. We require the importers of the Personal Data to comply with security standards and obligations imposed by applicable regulations, above all, the security requirements of the GDPR. We execute appropriate contractual arrangements to deal with such transfers, in particular in respect of Personal Data originating from Europe the standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission of the European Union and, following a thorough assessment, additional measures as required in accordance with the European Data Protection Board’s (EDPB) Recommendation no. 1/2020. You are invited to contact us via means provided in Section 12 hereof for more information in relation to the said safeguards.
Aircall also keeps monitoring the legislative development and latest guidance in relation to the personal data transfers outside Europe and commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities.

General information about Aircall's processing of customer personal data
1. What personal information does Aircall process in connection with the use of its services?
Aircall processes many categories of personal information – that is to say, personally identifiable information (PII), personal data, or however else such information is denominated by applicable privacy regulation - in connection with the use of Aircall services. Aircall categorizes this personal information as follows:
Customer account data – Basic information needed to establish and maintain your account with Aircall, such as company name and contact details, including information about the main contact person.
Customer contact data (from contact list) – Name, telephone number, owner and other information about contacts in the contact lists of the users.
Customer financial/payment data – Invoices and information about payment history. Please note that we do not store or in any other way process your full credit card information.
Information about user - Name, telephone number(s), role, metrics, IP address, device information of the users.
Call/SMS content – Content of messages sent via Aircall, call recordings, voicemails, voice transcriptions and AI Feature generated files from the voice transcriptions (Call summarization, Key topics, Talk ratio, etc.); which may contain special categories of personal data
Call/SMS metadata – Traffic data related to a particular communication, such as sender’s/caller’s and recipient’s telephone number or timestamp.
Additional call-related data - Notes, tags, insight cards attached to a particular communication.
Customer identity verification data - Information required by local laws for verification of customers identity for assignment of phone numbers in a given location, such as Customer’s physical address, Customer nationality, Customer type of personal ID.
Customer provided documentation – Proof of customer’s (representative) identity or address uploaded to Aircall account or sent to Aircall’s supporting team.
The examples provided for each category are indicative and may not constitute the full list of personal information processed as part of the said categories.
2. Is Aircall a processor under the GDPR and other European privacy laws?
Aircall, in most circumstances, processes the above-listed categories of personal information exclusively on behalf of its customers and acts as a data processor in the meaning of European data protection laws. As a result of that, Aircall concludes a
Data Processing Agreement
with its customers (see below for more information on how the DPA is concluded). Please consult the Data Processing Agreement for more information about how Aircall processes personal data on behalf of its customers.
There are certain instances however where Aircall processes the personal data for its own purposes and acts as a data controller.Please see more detail about this processing in our
Privacy Policy
.
3. As an Aircall customer, what do we need to do in order to conclude a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Aircall?
If you are Aircall customer, there is no action needed on your side in order to conclude a
Data Processing Agreement
(DPA) with Aircall. Upon signing-up for the Aircall service - whether by self-onboarding or by signing an order form with the help of our Sales representatives - you agree that the provision of Aircall services will be governed either by Aircall Terms of Use or by a Master Subscription Agreement. Unless explicitly agreed otherwise, in line with Section 9.1 of the Terms of Use or the Master Subscription Agreement, the Aircall DPA is an inseparable part thereof. Therefore, the DPA applies automatically to Aircall’s processing of your personal data.
4. Does Aircall advise its customers on how to comply with their privacy obligations when using Aircall services? How does Aircall help me comply with privacy compliance efforts?
Aircall services consist in the provision of a business phone solution (software as a service). Our customers may use the solution for various business use-cases and in different geographical areas. Aircall does not have control over the scope of particular data inserted by our customers in the Aircall solution, over the processing purposes for which our customers use such data, or over the scope of privacy laws applicable to such data. Aircall further fully recognizes that it is not entitled to provide legal advice to its customers. Therefore, Aircall cannot provide you, as an Aircall customer, with binding legal advice on how you should use the Aircall solution in compliance with the applicable laws to your particular case. Aircall, as a processor of the customer personal information, can neither guarantee that your usage of the Aircall solution will be compliant with the privacy laws applicable to you.
That said,
Aircall’s modern business phone solution itself provides customers with many features that can assist in bolstering your privacy compliance efforts under different privacy laws. Speaking more concretely, below are a few examples of how Aircall can help its customers comply with certain key privacy rights of individuals – data subjects.
Delete contact: If a customer of yours or a former user (agent) requests his/her information be deleted, you may do so directly through your dashboard. The data will be removed from the application however some personal information may remain in the call recordings or metadata. Use your options related to call recordings, as described in the next sections.
Right to information and consent for call recording: Create your own welcoming message for inbound calls – provide information on personal data processing and obtain consent for call recording via this feature. Your account manager and onboarding team will help you with the setting.
Right to access: Explore your export options in the dashboard. You can, for example, export the list of calls and call recordings made by a particular agent in the last 6 months.
Connecting to our API also provides a variety of options for data access – please explore these in our
API documentation
.
Ask for our assistance with a data subject request: If the self-service options described herein do not satisfy your privacy compliance needs, you can also reach out to Aircall
customer support
with your request. Please refer to the relevant section hereof for more detail on how Aircall assists with your data subject requests.
5. Does Aircall provide specific privacy compliance features for call recordings?
Yes. We process our customers’ call recordings exclusively on their behalf. We thus offer certain options to accommodate their instruction for their processing.
We by default store your call recording for the period indicated in your pricing plan, which may be indefinite (but always up to 30 days following the termination of your relationship with Aircall). This applies regardless of how long you can only see your call history in your dashboard.
Would you like us to change this retention period? Reach out to Aircall
customer support
(request will only be accommodated if submitted by admin user) and explain your needs.
Would you like us to delete a particular call or a bulk of calls made in certain time period in your account or by your user (agent)? Reach out to Aircall
customer support
(request will only be accommodated if submitted by admin user) and explain your needs.
Do you prefer to store your call recordings on your own infrastructure instead of using Aircall’s? Do you want to download your call recordings on a regular basis? You can download the recordings or use a webhook. Please see our tutorials for both options:
https://developer.aircall.io/tutorials/logging-calls/
https://developer.aircall.io/tutorials/store-recordings-on-dedicated-server/
6. How does Aircall AI process your data?
Our Aircall AI features are powered by a third party foundational model. As documented on our
Subprocessor page
the third party provider is Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft Corporation processes based on our specification the call transcripts on customers’ behalf to generate for the customer respective AI insights (Call Summarization, List of Topics, etc.). Microsoft Corporation is bound to process data solely for the purpose of generating AI insights and are subject to the same or more stringent data protection standards as the ones
guaranteed by Aircall under the
Data Processing Agreement
.
The transcripts are not used to train, retrain or improve Microsoft's foundational model.
The processing by Microsoft Corporation AI foundational model is ephemeral and the copy of transcript sent to Microsoft Corporation for processing by the AI foundational model as well as the resulting AI insights are deleted by Microsoft Corporation once the AI Insights are generated and sent to Aircall.
Data subject requests
7. How does Aircall assist its customers with the fulfillment of their obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights (DSRs) under the privacy laws?
Aircall invites its customers to submit all requests for assistance with DSRs via the dedicated GDPR section in Aircall
customer support
portal. Our support agents are at your disposal.
The requests will only be accommodated if submitted by an admin user.
We proceed with your request according to the applicable law. Please note that within such procedures, we also assess whether we are required to accommodate such requests. If this is not the case, we inform you accordingly and discuss possible solutions.
For example, if you request that we delete call metadata related to a particular individual, who asked you to do so under GDPR, we may not be able to accommodate your request, as we may find ourselves obliged to keep such data for a certain period under applicable European telecommunications law. In such a case, we have a legitimate reason to keep the metadata (process them for our own purpose – providing access to such metadata upon request of a public authority), we will restrict the processing of the call metadata by (i) removing them from your dashboard but (ii) maintaining them for the above-described processing purpose(s), as data controllers, in dedicated databases in our system.
Data protection impact assessment
8. As an Aircall customer, do we need to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA)? If so, how does Aircall support its customers in carrying out the DPIA?
In relation to the processing of personal information necessary for the provision of the Aircall service, your company acts as a data controller, i.e. your company decides also on the purposes for which your data is used by the users of your Aircall account (on the use-cases for which you use our platform). Thus it is also your own responsibility to (i) evaluate whether a DPIA needs to be carried out for your usage of the Aircall service, and (ii) potentially carry out your DPIA under the applicable laws. Aircall does not possess the information required under the applicable laws to carry out the DPIA for you, however, we are committed to assisting you in your DPIA efforts.
For example, where the GDPR (incl. the UK GDPR) applies, Article 35(7) of the (UK) GDPR requires that the DPIA contains the following [see in square brackets the references to materials provided by Aircall to support your DPIA efforts]:
(a) A systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller; [For the description of the envisaged processing operations, please see the description of the processing purposes and activities in Exhibit A of Aircall
Data Processing Agreement
(DPA). Further description of processing purposes and legitimate interests, where applicable, depends on your company’s use cases, i.e. whether you use Aircall for direct marketing, customer support, general outbound marketing, intra-group communication etc.]
(b) An assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes; [Since this assessment is derived from information under letter (a), it depends on your company’s use cases.]
(c) An assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and [Since this assessment must also be derived from information under letter (a), it again depends on your company’s use cases.]
(d) The measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. [In this part please feel free to refer to the security-related information provided on our
Security page
, Exhibit B of our
Data Processing Agreement
, and relevant sections of the
Data Processing Agreement
related to the data transfers.]
Please also have in mind that the Data Protection Authorities in different countries suggest using different templates for the DPIA and even use different lists of activities for which the DPIA needs / needs not to be carried out.
Personal data transfers
9. Does Aircall use third parties (subprocessors) to process personal information on its customers behalf? Can Aircall provide more detail about why and where such third parties process the personal information?
Yes, Aircall uses third parties, as well as various entities from the Aircall group of companies - subprocessors - to process personal information on customers’ behalf. Sharing some of the customer information with these subprocessors is necessary for the provision of the Aircall service, including ensuring that the Aircall platform operates properly in line with the contracted standard.
Please see more information about why and where such third parties process the personal information
here
. The referred document forms an inseparable part of the
Data Processing Agreement
between Aircall and its customers. Sections 5 and 6 of the Data Processing Agreement further describe Aircall’s commitments in relation to the usage of the subprocessors.
10. Does Aircall transfer European personal data to third countries on behalf of its customers?
Which mechanisms are used by Aircall for such transfers?
Yes. Personal data inserted into the Aircall platform are processed in third countries, which may not
or may
benefit from European Commission’s (and/or the UK government’s
and/or the Swiss Federal Council’s
) adequacy decision (“adequate third countries” / “non-adequate third countries”).
An up-to-date list of all countries, to which Aircall transfers personal data (including the non-adequate countries), and the respective subprocessors, can be found in Sections 5 and 6 of the
Data Processing Agreement
(DPA).
Where Aircall transfers personal data processed on behalf of its customer to an
adequate country
, the transfer mechanism used by Aircall is the corresponding adequacy decision.
Where Aircall transfers personal data processed on behalf of its customer to a
non-adequate country
, such transfer is subject to standard contractual clauses concluded between Aircall and the recipient of the personal data (subprocessor).
Exceptionally, where a third party subprocessor adheres to binding corporate rules, as defined by the GDPR, the applicability of which is extended to transfers to/from third parties outside the subprocessor’s group of undertakings, such binding corporate rules may be the applicable transfer mechanism.
11. Is Aircall certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, its UK Extension, and/or the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework?
Yes. Aircall participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF, together with the EU-U.S. DPF, including the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, jointly referred to as “DPF”). Aircall has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that its entity incorporated in the U.S. (
Aircall.io
, Inc.) adheres to the DPF Principles with regard to all processing of personal data. Therefore, whenever
Aircall.io
, Inc. processes European personal data on behalf of Aircall customers, such processing is subject to the DPF. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view Aircall’s certification, please visit:
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
12. Did Aircall perform a transfer impact assessment (TIA) and implement any supplementary measures?
Aircall has performed and keeps continuously developing a six-step transfer impact assessment (TIA) with respect to these data transfers in line with EDPB’s Recommendations 1/2020 and subsequent guidance provided by the EDPB and the European Commission. Aircall does not share the TIA externally for confidentiality reasons and due to the living nature of the TIA. Please find below, however, a summary of Aircall’s current findings in the TIA:
Step 1 as per the EDPB’s Recommendations 1/2020 - We work from the fact that Aircall transfers personal data, which Aircall processes on behalf of its customers, to its suppliers listed in the subprocessors list in Section 5.1. of our
DPA
. These subprocessors process the transferred data in four non-adequate countries:
The USA
(where the subprocessor’s processing of personal data is not subject to the DPF);
Vietnam;
Australia; and
India.
Step 2 - Our transfers rely on the following mechanisms:
The Standard Contractual Clauses 2021 (with most of the subprocessors);
Steps 3 & 4 - Assessment of effectiveness of the mechanisms, i.e. assessment of the law and practices of the third countries in the context of the specific transfers, and identification of supplementary measures:
USA - The legal framework and its non-adequacy has been broadly assessed by the CJEU in the Schrems II decision, as well as consequent decisions of various national DPAs. Based on these precedents (and taking into account Section 40 of the EC’s SCCs 2021 FAQs) we conclude that:
The Standard Contractual Clauses 2021 are likely to provide effective safeguards for most of our transfers due to its strict procedure for disclosure requests and also considering our strong security measures (most notably the encryption of all data in transit and at rest - see our
Security page
for more detail). However, we are taking a conservative approach and we are currently implementing the following additional technical safeguards with respect to our most “sensitive“ transfers:
Hosting - We are deploying a multi-regional hosting solution, based on which we currently offer hosting of call recordings and voicemails on servers located in Germany. All other data processed by Aircall (account data, user data, call analytics etc..) is hosted on servers in the US.
Adjustments to EU infrastructure of various subprocessors - Several of Aircall's subprocessors recently started offering an EU-based infrastructure, to which we are aiming at moving our operations, thus eliminating third-country data transfers to these providers.
Vietnam - To our knowledge there is no precedent decision regarding the laws and practices in Vietnam. Aircall adopts the same approach as for the transfers to the USA. We believe these measures are sufficient also considering the circumstances of our transfer of data to Vietnam - the corresponding subprocessor has solely a remote access to Aircall’s security logs. The security logs contain pseudonymised data (user IDs, call IDs..). We believe that such access constitutes a data transfer under the (UK) GDPR definitions, however, it is a very limited transfer.
Australia & India - The transfers to Australia & India are limited to intragroup processors.
To our knowledge there is no precedent decision regarding the laws and practices in Australia or India. For intragroup transfers Aircall has an Intra-Group Data Processing and Transfer Agreement in place, which contains all mandatory clauses under the applicable laws (incl. under Articles 26(1) and 28(3) of the GDPR), regulates the rights and obligations of each group entity with respect to the processing of personal data shared in the group, and includes Standard Contractual Clauses 2021 for transfers of personal data to non-adequate third countries. We also enforce unified security standards (see Section 11 below) that must be upheld across the group and are subject to periodical external audit.
The intragroup subprocessors are provided solely with remote access and only for selected / dedicated employees (need-to-know principle as per our access control policy).
Steps 5 & 6 - As per above.
Security and storage
13. How does Aircall protect its customers’ data?
Aircall has established technical and organizational safeguards to protect customer data including the personal information processed by Aircall on customers' behalf.
Aircall maintains an information security program striving to meet the ever-evolving industry standards, constantly assessing and monitoring the level of security provided to customer data and ensuring appropriate reaction to information security incidents, including personal data breaches.
The technical and organizational safeguards form a part of our commitment to our customers as described in our
Data Processing Agreement
.
Please see also our
Security page
for more detail on the currently applied technical and organizational safeguards.
14. Where does Aircall store its customers’ data?
Personal information processed by Aircall in relation to the usage of its products and services is hosted on AWS servers in the following locations:

Please note that this includes the voice transcriptions and AI Feature generated files from the voice transcriptions, which are currently stored exclusively on AWS US West servers in Oregon, USA, regardless of where transcribed call recording or voicemail is stored.
All personal information stored by Aircall is encrypted (at transit using TLS 1.2, at rest AES-256).
If you want to obtain more information or coordinate the storage location of your call recordings and voicemails, please contact your Customer Success Manager or Aircall’s Privacy team.
15. How long does Aircall keep its customers’ data for? How can an Aircall customer ensure deletion of data when needed?
Aircall follows its Customer Data Retention Policy, which sets retention periods for the different categories of personal information, as described below.
For categories of personal information processed exclusively on behalf of the customer, we invite each customer:
To use self-service options inside Aircall product for deletion ofCustomer's contact data (from contact list), Additional call-related data (notes, tags and insight cards) and Customer provided documents; and
To inform our sales representative before opening your Aircall account or to contact Aircall’s

At Aircall we keep up to date with the current development of the privacy regulation and case law including post-Brexit privacy regulation in the UK and make sure to reflect necessary changes in our privacy compliance program.
Where sharing some of the customers’ personal information with subprocessors from third countries is necessary, we ensure adequate level of data protection of UK data subjects is met. Unless the recipients are located in countries that have been deemed adequate by the UK Government, we put in place data transfer agreements based on the applicable European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses as modified by the international data transfer Addendum approved by the UK Parliament or rely on other available data transfer mechanisms to protect the personal data so transferred.
17. Is Aircall registered with the ICO?
Yes. In accordance with the UK GDPR, Aircall is registered as a data processing entity with the Information Commissioner Office (ICO). For more information please consult our ICO registration

Framework specifics: HIPAA
18. Is the Aircall solution HIPAA compliant?
If you are a covered entity or a business associate under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and you are interested in using the Aircall product for the processing of the protected health information (PHI), you might be concerned about Aircall's compliance with the obligations set forth by HIPAA and applicable to Aircall as your potential business associate.
We offer our customers the opportunity to enter into Aircall’s Business Associate Agreement, which you should sign if you will disclose any PHI to Aircall. Our Business Associate Agreement is tailored to the specifics of the Aircall product and services. Please note that it is your responsibility to let us know that you are a covered entity or business associate and you plan to disclose PHI to Aircall.
Aircall's privacy and security practices are designed to safeguard PHI disclosed to us pursuant to a business associate agreement in line with the parties’ obligations under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. You may at any time ask your Aircall sales representative or reach out to Aircall's privacy and security team for more information about these practices.
