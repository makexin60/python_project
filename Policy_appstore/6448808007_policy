If you choose to interact with any such advertising, plugins or content, information about your activities on the Channels to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests may be shared with the relevant third party provider. If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria;

to third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, analytics providers and retailers).
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain third party services (
“Third Party Features”
). Examples of Third Party Features include “liking” or “sharing” content over social media platforms through our Service or linking your Humble Bundle account to a third party service such as Steam, Twitch, or Battle.net. If you use Third Party Features, both Humble Bundle and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Service and the third party service. For example, if you link your Humble Bundle account to Steam, we may receive information related to your Steam account for the duration of the linking, including information about the games you own on the Service. Similarly, if you post information on a third party service that references our Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Humble Bundle in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with our Service or that third party service. We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein or any information third parties obtain through your use of Third Party Features. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey.

Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Humble Bundle advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Humble Bundle reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.
Some of our advertisers may use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements, for OBA or otherwise, and perform related services when you interact with the Channels. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services.

You may request a copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses by using our
DSAR Portal
.

However, we cannot guarantee there will not be a breach, and we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any third parties.
Because the internet is an open system, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
