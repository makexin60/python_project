(a)                If your principal place of business is in the United States or Canada, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures.  If your principal place of business is in any country other than the United States or Canada, then the arbitration will be administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.  If your principal place of business is outside of the United States, Canada or any country in APAC, then the arbitration will be administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in accordance with ICC Rules of Arbitration.  The arbitration rules specified in this subsection are referred to as the “Rules.”  For the purposes of this EULA, “APAC” means the geographic region that includes the following countries: Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, China (including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Macau Special Administrative Region), Christmas Islands, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, Laos, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Mongolia, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Vietnam.
(b)                Either party may commence the arbitration process called for by this EULA by filing a written demand for arbitration with the applicable arbitration organization and delivering a copy of such demand to the other party to this EULA in accordance with the notice provision of this EULA.  In no event shall demand for arbitration be made or permitted after the date when the institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such Dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  If your principal place of business is in the United States or Canada, the place of arbitration will be Chicago, Illinois, United States.  If your principal place of business is in a country in APAC, the place of arbitration will be Singapore.  If your principal place of business is outside of the United States, Canada or any country in APAC, the place of arbitration will be Geneva, Switzerland.  The arbitration shall be conducted in English.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your principal place of business is in the Netherlands, you may opt to resolve any Dispute before Dutch courts, provided that you notify Caterpillar of this election within thirty (30) days of Caterpillar notifying you of Caterpillar’s intention to commence arbitration.
(c)                 You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action, and that the parties are waiving the right to a trial by jury.  If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, each party waives any right to a jury trial.  NEITHER USER NOR CATERPILLAR SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHER USERS WITH RESPECT TO OTHER ACCOUNTS, BRING MASS, CLASS ACTION, OR CONSOLIDATED CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION OR A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR USER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.
(d)                If the Dispute is for an amount less than US$100,000, the arbitration shall be heard in front of a single arbitrator, and if the Dispute is for an amount of US$100,000 or more, then the Dispute shall be heard by a panel of three (3) arbitrators.  If the Dispute is to be heard in front of a single arbitrator, then the parties shall attempt to mutually agree on the identity of the arbitrator, or if no such agreement can be reached within thirty (30) days of the commencement of the arbitration proceedings, the applicable arbitration organization shall appoint such arbitrator in accordance with the Rules.  If the Dispute is to be heard in front of a panel of three (3) arbitrators, each party shall nominate one arbitrator from a list of arbitrators provided by the applicable arbitration organization, and the two party-nominated arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator who will serve as chairman.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, either party may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm from occurring at any time.  Each party shall bear its own cost of prosecuting or defending the arbitration (excluding any attorneys’ or other professional fees) and the parties shall split the arbitrators’ fees and the applicable arbitration organization’s administrative costs, regardless of the outcome.  The provisions of this Section 12.3 and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.  The arbitrator(s) shall render its decision as soon as reasonably possible after its appointment and must follow the terms of this EULA.
(e)                This agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Any award issued by the arbitrator pursuant to any arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment may be entered upon in accordance with applicable Laws in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(f)                 Arbitration proceedings are confidential unless all parties agree otherwise.  Arbitration orders and awards required to be filed with applicable courts of competent jurisdiction are not confidential and may be disclosed by the parties to such courts.  A party who improperly discloses Confidential Information shall be subject to sanctions.  The arbitrator and forum may disclose case filings, case dispositions, and other case information as required by a court order of proper jurisdiction.
(g)                YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF SECTION 12.3.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION, THEN WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM YOUR FIRST AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS PART OF THESE TERMS BY SENDING AN E-MAIL TO cat_customer_care@cat.com.  Any opt-out received after the thirty (30) day time period will not be valid and you must pursue your claim via arbitration pursuant to this EULA.
