We store your personal data in servers located in the European Economic Area (EEA), but we may use service providers that are based elsewhere in limited occasions. In cases where your personal data may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) we ensure the lawfulness of the transfer using a valid legal mechanism. These mechanisms include adequacy decisions adopted by the European Commission concerning a specific country and European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers of personal data. In addition, we use additional security safeguards such as encryption to ensure the security of the personal data transferred.
Currently we have suppliers based in the U.S. with whom we have entered into European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers of personal data. Contact us at info@getsteven.com if you want more detailed information on the recipients of the personal data and/or a copy of the measures that we have taken with such recipient to protect the data.
7. Information about your rights under the GDPR
Below is an overall description of the rights you have under the General Data Protection Regulation. You exercise your rights by contacting us. You can contact us by email, info@getsteven.com, or letter to us at BOX 5183, 102 44 Stockholm, Sweden.
Upon receipt of your request, we will make an assessment of the request to determine if it is justified. All rights set forth below are not absolute and exceptions may be made.
We shall answer to your request without undue delay and at least within one (1) month. The replay will be in writing but, upon your request the information can be given orally (provided that we have been able to identify you).
Right to information
.
You have the right to be informed about how your personal data is processed, such information shall be provided in connection with the collection of data about you. We do this through this privacy policy. We will also make sure to answer any questions you have regarding the processing.
If something happens to your personal information that may affect you negatively, you have the right to know. In that case, we will contact you.
Right to access
.
You have the right to obtain a confirmation as to whether we process personal data about you, and where that is the case, you have the right to get access to the data, together with information about the processing. Such information shall include, among other things, the purposes of the processing and who we will share your data with (recipients).
We will provide you with a copy of the personal data processed. If such a copy would adversely affect someone else’s rights and freedoms, the copy may need to be restricted e.g. we may need to mask personal information about another person. If you have made your request by electronic means, we will provide you the information in an electronic form, unless you request otherwise.
Right to rectification (correction)
. The personal data we process about you must be correct, accurate and complete for the purpose in question. You have the right to request rectification of inaccurate personal data of you. You also have the right to request that we complete with relevant personal data that you believe is missing.
Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)
.
You have the right to request erasure of your personal data. In the following cases we must delete your personal data: the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected; the processing is carried out based on your consent and you revoke this; the processing takes place for direct marketing and you oppose this; the processing turned out to be unlawfully processed; or deletion is required to fulfil a legal obligation.
We are also obliged to delete your personal data if you have objected to the processing, and we have no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing that outweigh your interest.
The right to erasure is not an absolute right and there may be legal obligations, contractual relations, and compelling legitimate interests which require us to continue the processing. We are also entitled to continue the processing if necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Right to restriction of processing
.
In certain cases, you have the right to request restriction on the use of your personal data, e.g., if the accuracy or legality of the personal data is under investigation by us. For instance, if you have requested that incorrect personal data shall be corrected, or if you have objected to the processing. This means that while the matter is being assessed, you can request that the processing of the relevant data also is restricted.
You can also request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in cases where we usually should erase the data; this applies if we no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you need it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. This also applies if the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of such personal data of yours.
If we have restricted the processing, we may nevertheless process the restricted data a) for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, b) to protect another natural or legal person’s rights, or c) for reasons of important public interest. We may also process them if we have received your consent.
If we have restricted your personal data, we will notify you before the restriction expires.
Right to object
.
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data if the legal basis for the processing is a balance of interests, or to perform a task of public interest. If you object to the processing, we must cease the processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defence legal claims.
You always have the right to object to us using your information for direct marketing purposes, we must then cease such processing activities.
Right to data portability
.
If you have provided personal data to us and given us your consent for processing, or if you have provided personal data due to an agreement with us, and the processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive the personal data in a structured, commonly used electronic form.
You also have the right to have the personal data transferred to another controller, e.g. another company, if technically feasible. For example, if you want to use their services instead.
Right to withdraw your consent
.
If we are processing your personal data on the basis of your consent, you may withdraw this consent at any time. Your withdrawal does not affect the legality of our processing up to the point of your withdrawal.
The right to object to automated decision-making and profiling
. We do not carry out processing and do not make decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling.
Right to make a complaint
.
If you are not satisfied with how we are processing your personal data, we ask that you contact us. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, which in Sweden is the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (www.imy.se), Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten, Box 8114, SE-104 20 Stockholm.
