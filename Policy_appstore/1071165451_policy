3. How we process children’s personal
        data
Our websites
,
products and
        services
are not
primarily intended for
children.
A child must not
        create a
Huacheng
account without
        the consent of a parent or guardian. If a child's personal data is collected with prior parental consent, we
        will only use or disclose the data as permitted by law, with the explicit consent of the child's parents or
        guardians, or when necessary for the protection of the child.
Huacheng
strongly recommends that parents take an active role in
        supervising the online activities of their children. If you believe we might have any information from or about
        a child, please contact us at

. How
we store and protect your personal
        data
4.1
Data Security Measures
We have implemented appropriate technical and
        organizational measures designed to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access,
        use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind
        firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.
We also provide training on security and privacy
        protection for employees to raise their awareness of personal data protection.
We are
committed to protecting your personal data; however,
you should be aware that the use of the
        Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any
personal data
when transferred from you or to you via the
        Internet.
We handle personal data breaches as required by applicable
        data protection law which includes, where required, notifying the breach to the relevant data protection
        supervisory authority and data subjects.
4.2 Retention Policy
Your personal data will be retained for as long as
        required for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or in so far as such is necessary for compliance with
        statutory obligations and for solving any disputes.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal
        data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from
unauthorised
use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for
        which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
        applicable legal requirements.
We will retain
        your
personal
        data
for no longer than is necessary for the purposes stated in this Policy, unless otherwise extending the retention
period
        is required or permitted by law.
We will cease to
        retain and delete or anonymize
personal
        data
once the purpose of collection is fulfilled, or after we confirm your request for erasure, or after we terminate
        the operation of the corresponding service.
Please pay attention that video recordings and snapshots
        within
Imou
App are automatically deleted after the cloud service or
        the cloud saving period ends. And the retention periods of alarm messages, alarm snapshots and IP addresses in
        API logs are just 7 days.
An exception to this is personal data that we are
        processing for public interest, scientific, historical research, or statistical purposes.
Huacheng
will continue to retain this type of information for
        longer than its standard retention period, where permitted based on applicable laws or your request, even if
        further data processing is not related to the original purpose of collection.

8. Your Rights
to your personal data
You can review and change your personal data by logging
        into your account on our website and visiting your account profile page.
You may also send us an e-mail at
privacy@imoulife.com
to request access to, or require us to correct or delete
        any personal data that you have provided to us. You may also object to or request us to restrict your
        processing. If we process your personal data based on consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by
        contacting us (see below). A summary of your legal rights is set out below:

Request
        access
to your personal data (commonly known as a
        “
data subject
        access request
”). This enables
        you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing
        it.
If you want to access your head portrait, user name, email
        address and other basic information, or video, image, order, device and other service information on your
Imou
account, you can enter
Imou
and tap on corresponding function button to access
        relevant information.

Request
        correction
of the personal data that we hold about
        you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need
        to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
If you want to change your nickname, email address, etc.
        on your
Imou
account, enter
Imou
, tap on related function button.

Request
        erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to
        ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also
        have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right
        to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
        required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to
        comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at
        the time of your request.
If you want to delete the basic information such as email
        address, and password, or service information such as video, image, cloud record and alarm on your
Imou
account, you can delete your information by tapping on
        related data clear function button through “Me->Settings->Account and Security->Delete Account”.

Object to
        processing
of your personal data
        where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your
        particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
        fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
object where we are
        processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
        compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

Request restriction of
        processing
of your personal data. This enables you to
        ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
        establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c)
        where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or
        defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have
        overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

Request the
        transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third
        party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly
        used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially
        provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
We have the right
        to refuse to process requests that are frivolous, requests that damage others' right of privacy, extremely
        unrealistic requests, requests that require disproportionate technical work, and requests not required under
        local law, information that have been made public, information given under confidential conditions. If we
        believe that certain aspects of the request to delete or access the information may result in our inability to
        legally use the information for the aforementioned anti-fraud and security purposes, it may also be
        rejected.

Withdraw consent at any
        time
where we are relying on consent to process
        your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
        withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services
        to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you want to disable user experience program and alarm
        information on your
Imou
account, you can enter
Imou
and tap on corresponding close button to turn it
        off

For security reasons, we will take steps to authenticate
        your identity before providing access to your personal data.
If you think that
        the way we process your
personal
        data
does not comply with applicable data protection laws, you can contact the relevant competent data protection
        authority.
