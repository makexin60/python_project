FAQ
How do I create an App Activity Report?
Go to the “Settings” app of your device, “Privacy” and choose “Record App Activity”. Turn on the toggle. From now on, all app activity will be recorded, for up to seven days.
Come back after you used the apps you want to investigate and click “Save App Activity”. Save the file to your files.
Now open
App Activity Viewer
and open the file.
Where can I report errors?

Does the app send my data somewhere?
No. The data stays on your phone. The app only tries to load the icons and names of the apps that you recorded, because the file only contains the “bundleID”. This is done via the official Apple iTunes API.
