Automated decision-making
‍
We do not use automated-decision making methods (including profiling). This means decisions are not made by robots or computers, and therefore not ‘automated’. However, certain third parties may use certain automated decision-making tools or software. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of others and will take reasonable steps to bring such automated decision-making to your attention, but you are encouraged to become familiar with the privacy practices of any third parties you enter into any agreements with.
Use of Third Party Applications & Cookies
‍
We use the following third party services which may also include the use of cookies. Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer or device used to access a website. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. They allow the website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you visit one of our websites or browse from one page to another. They also enable us to track and monitor activity on our website to improve our services (for marketing and functionality purposes) as well as allowing you to interact with social media services.
We also use LocalStorage, which works in a similar way to cookie, but stores a larger file onto your device which helps our websites and apps function. The use of LocalStorage is a necessary function when using our app which cannot run without the use of LocalStorage.
In addition to the uses of cookies described above, these entities may use other methods, such as the technologies described below, to collect information about your use of our website and other websites and online services. These are:
Pixels tags: Pixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels), are small pieces of code that can be embedded on websites and emails. Pixels tags may be used to learn how you interact with our website pages and emails, and this information helps us and our partners provide you with a more tailored experience.
Device Identifiers: A device identifier is a unique label that can be used to identify a mobile device. Device identifiers may be used to track, analyse and improve the performance of the website and ads delivered.
We use the following third party processors:
Posthog Analytics
We use Posthog Analytics to analyze the use of our website and app. Posthog Analytics gathers information about website use by means of cookies. The information gathered relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of our website.
Posthog's privacy policy is available at: https://posthog.com/privacy
We do not store the information collected by Posthog Analytics and this is stored by them.
We also use customer.io and Stripe for marketing and payments.
‍
How long we keep your information for
‍
We retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which we process the information as set out in this Privacy Policy. Records can be held on a variety of media (physical or electronic) and formats.
Retention periods are determined based on the type of record, the nature of the record and activity and the legal or regulatory requirements that apply to those records. Typically, personal data which is collected are retained for 5 years. Where personal data is collected pursuant to a contract or prior to the creation of a contract, these are retained for 6 years after the termination of the contract pursuant to our legitimate interests in defending any legal claims which may be brought against us.
However, we may retain your personal data for a longer period of time where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person or where we have a legitimate interest to do so.
‍
Sharing your personal information
‍
We may pass your information to our Business Partners, administration centres, third party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing our services to you.
In addition, when we use any other third party service providers, we will disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service required and we will ensure, via contractual obligations, that this requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.
In addition, we may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of some, or all, of our business and assets or as part of any business restructuring or reorganisation, or if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation. However, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.
Transferring your information outside of the European Economic Area (for EEA Clients)
‍
We may share your personal data with third party companies where we have a legal basis for doing so such as to provide you with our services or because we ourselves use service providers outside of EEA in order to operate our business.  If we transfer your information outside of the EEA to third parties we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Policy. This may require us to take certain additional steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place if that third country is not deemed by the European Commission to offer an adequate level of protection for your privacy rights, which may include use of contractual safeguards to allow you to be able to enforce your rights and ensure these are preserved. In certain circumstances, we may need to ask you for your explicit consent to such third country transfers,  and will always do so in writing and giving you full information about why we need your consent and your right to withdraw that consent at any time (together with the consequences of withdrawal).

‍
You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified and to have any incomplete personal information about you completed. You may also request that we restrict the processing of that information. The accuracy of your information is important to us.

• The performance of a task carried out in the public interest;

‍
Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing

• you contest the accuracy of the personal information;
• where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of the unlawfully processed personal information;
• we no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the services we can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.
‍

‍
Right to freedom from automated decision-making
As explained above, we do not use automated decision-making, but where any automated decision-making takes place, you have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision, as well as request that decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based on your personal data are made by natural persons, not only by computers.
‍
Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)
You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless:
you have a business relationship with us, and we rely on our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing (as described above)
you have otherwise given your prior consent (such as when you download one of our guides)
You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us on the above details. On each and every marketing communication, we will always provide the option for you to exercise your right to object to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes (known as ‘opting-out’) by clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ button on our marketing emails or choosing a similar opt-out option on any forms we use to collect your data. You may also opt-out at any time by contacting us on the below details.
Please note that any administrative or service-related communications (to offer our services, or notify you of an update to this Privacy Policy or applicable terms of business, etc.) will solely be directed at our clients or business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the services requested. Therefore, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our website or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.
Right to request access
You also have a right to access information we hold about you. We are happy to provide you with details of your Personal Information that we hold or process.
