We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your children have provided us with Personal Data, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
Use of AI
Most current AI concerns focus on generative AI, like ChatGPT. This type of AI creates new content, such as text and images. Predictive AI is another category of artificial intelligence that can be used to classify or make predictions from existing data.
Occasionally, Pocket Prep may use AI to generate content that is then checked and edited by our in-house subject matter experts. Generative AI has other potential use cases to enhance our product offering, and we have invested in ongoing research and development to better understand how we might leverage this powerful tool to serve our customers.
Pocket Prep uses predictive AI for our Readiness Score, a metric that helps our internal team know how well our features are preparing customers for their exams. The model comprises more than 50 features, and the interaction of those features predicts the likelihood of passing at any given time. Our internal teams can then monitor how new product features impact exam day readiness.
Data Storage
Our product utilizes AI components by converting data into Embedding Vectors, which are stored in a Vector Store Database. Open-source reranking and generative models may be used for retrieval and processing.
AI Technologies
The AI technologies incorporated in our product include Predictive AI, which anticipates future outcomes based on historical data to inform decision-making, and Generative AI, where we apply techniques like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to produce accurate and relevant outputs. We also employ Reranking Algorithms to reorder and prioritize results, ensuring the most pertinent information is presented first. Additionally, we leverage Deep Learning, particularly neural networks, to process and understand complex patterns within large datasets.
Bias Testing
Neither we nor any third parties have identified any bias within our AI components, and they have not been tested for bias.
