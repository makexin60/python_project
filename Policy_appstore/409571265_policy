Privacy Policy
Your child's privacy is our top priority.
None of our apps collect or store personal information. We do not incorporate social media software within our apps. None of our apps use email, phone or webcam features inherent with smartphone or tablet devices. We do not include third-party analytics software in our apps.
EFlashApps is committed to respecting and protecting individuals' privacy rights and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes complying with the new obligations under the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) rules effective on July 1, 2013.
The amended COPPA rules effective on July 1, 2013 apply to operators of websites and mobile apps that are directed at children under 13 that collect, use or disclose personal information from children or to operators that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information from users of sites or apps directed to children. The existing obligation requiring parental consent before collecting personal information from children has been expanded to include persistent identifiers that can enable operators and third parties to recognize users. The FTC’s guidance and FAQs relating to COPPA are located at:
