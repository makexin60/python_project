5. WHAT DATA ABOUT ME IS VISIBLE TO OTHER USERS
Social features are a core component of our Service. Other users may, for example, see your profile data, activities (exercises) and read the messages and other content you have posted. By default, all your data is private, except your public profile, which allows your friends to find you. You can freely decide what information you add to your profile page.
A public profile is visible in the whole Sports Tracker Community when searched by name or email. This means that when you add data to your public profile in one of the applications in the Sports Tracker Community, your public profile is also visible in the other applications. Your profile page displays the following data publicly:
Name
Username
Description
Profile picture and background photo
People you follow and people who follow you
Total distance, split by sports
Total activities (exercises)
List of your activities (exercises) that are set to Public
Visibility of an activity (exercise or workout) means the sharing setting of each tracked or logged activity. For simplicity and clarity, the default visibility for your activities (exercises) is Private. There are three visibility options you can choose from:
Public: Anyone can view and comment on your activity (exercise). Any user that browses public workouts can find and view the activity (exercise).
Followers: Only followers can view and comment on your activity (exercise). Users that do not follow you cannot find or open the activity (exercise).
Private: Your activities are visible only to you.
In order to create certain anonymous data such as heatmaps of tracks frequently used by users there may be certain features which allow you to enable the collection of certain location data during your activities (exercises) as specified in the applicable visibility options.
Moreover, there may also be certain features which allow you to enable automatic collection of certain location data from your device to the app when your device becomes connected to the app.
In addition to the above, you can also choose to share your activity in an external service, like Facebook. In this case a special link to your activity is created, and anyone following that link can access the activity (exercise).
Leaderboard view displays weekly total information of you and the persons you follow. Likewise, people you have accepted to follow you can see your information:
Name
Total duration of all activities
Other information identified in the Leaderboard within the app
Please note that different apps and versions may have different visibility configurations.
6. ADVERTISING AND SOCIAL MEDIA PARTNERS
If you decide to use your Facebook account and credentials for your log in to the Services, We will receive data such as your name, email address, birth date, gender and profile photo and friends list (to inform you which of your friends have already joined or later join the Services) from Facebook. If you wish not to provide Us with such information, you will need to amend the privacy settings on your Facebook account, so please review the applicable privacy statements and instructions from Facebook for further information.
Our website uses social media functions (i.e. social plug-ins), for example Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube buttons that take you to community pages held by Us. When you use these social plugins, social media services share user data with Us in accordance with their privacy policies and user consents, e.g. comments and links on Suunto websites shared by the user in the media, as well as information contained in the user's public profile.

These advertising partners may use this data (and similar data collected from other services) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third-party services within their networks.
