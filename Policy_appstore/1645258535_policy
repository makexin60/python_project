- hereinafter simply “
the Company
”, needs to acquire some data, acting therefore as a
Data Controller

Permissions granted to the App
When opening the App, you are asked to give the following permissions:
Camera: only for momentary QR-code scanning; no data are stored
Location (on Android): sometimes required to use Bluetooth: your location is not saved and no geolocation takes place.
The App supports Android versions from 6 onwards: therefore for some more obsolete versions of the OS, you need to grant specific Bluetooth permissions as this function was not separate from the location function. In this way the installation is suitable for a greater number of cases or devices.
Location (on IOS): your location is not saved and no geolocation takes place.
Access to the device's local memory: required for creating the database and saving App essential data. Specifically, the following data are saved:
the type of product you are connecting to
calls to the cloud while the App is offline
the following settings:
App ID. randomly generated when the App is first launched (not tied to your device)
Cloud configuration for when the App is offline
the last date the App communicated with the server
App usage data (determining whether the tutorial, the home screen or the registration request is to be shown again)

of
Data
provision, consequences of refusal of processing

User profiling is not carried out in any way.
R
ecipients of your
Data
- Accessibility
For the purposes referred to in Art. 4, your data may be made accessible to:
the employees and collaborators of the
Controller
in their capacity as
Authorised parties
and/or
Persons in charge of data processing
(appointed pursuant to Art. 30 of the current Privacy Code) and/or

Data processing

Processors
on the basis of specific written directives from the
Controller
aimed at ensuring compliance with privacy legislation and the adoption of adequate security measures.
The list of
independent Data Processors and Controllers
is contained in the
Controller
's process and data protection management document kept at its registered office and can be consulted by sending an express request to the details indicated in the
Contact
section.
Third-party recipients of your data - provision and transfer
Processed
Data
will not be transferred to third parties unless this is required to fulfil specific legislative, regulatory and/or disciplinary obligations (Public Bodies; Financial Administration, Judicial Administration etc.)
Processed
Data
will not be transferred to third countries outside the EU unless this is required to fulfil the services (
Services
) expressly requested by you with a counterpart located in such countries. In this case, if necessary, we will provide you, in advance, with separate information illustrating the appropriate legal guarantees that must accompany such transfer.
Data storage method and period
All personal
Data
will be processed in compliance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, relevance and proportionality and only using IT or telematic methods that are strictly necessary to pursue the purposes described above.
Personal data managed at a computerised level are stored in the memory of servers located in Italy, with network connection (a limited and closed network which can only be consulted by entering mandatory personal passwords as well as other IT security measures). Such measures, along with additional protection measures taken by the
Controller,
are aimed at protecting data against the risk of unauthorised access or unauthorised processing, as well as against the risk of loss, alteration or destruction, even if only accidental.
Data Processing
will be carried out for the period of time necessary to the contractual performance or pre-contractual measures requested by the
Data subject
, unless specific legal provisions (tax, accounting and security provisions) or the legitimate interest of the
Controller
(Art. 6(1)(f)  GDPR) provide or allow for a different term. In the event of a dispute with the data subject and/or third parties, data will be processed for as long as strictly necessary to ensure the protection of rights.
The legitimate interest of the
Controller
in the storage of
Data
is generally quantified in 24 months from termination of the contractual relationship or from the provision of the services indicated in paragraph 2. This term was calculated by processing statistical results of aggregate and non-personal data regarding the usefulness, opportunity or need to reuse
Personal Data
even after termination of the contractual performance to facilitate the Data subject in requesting or obtaining ancillary or new contractual services.
After this term, the
Data
will be erased.
Place of storage
The Data collected by the
Controller
will be stored in a certified Cloud system located in Italy; this infrastructure means that App-related IT resources are managed by a specialised external provider.
This involved an a priori evaluation of the Provider to check whether the latter had adopted technical and organisational measures suitable to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, so that the processing to be entrusted thereto satisfied the legal requirements and ensured the protection of the data subject’s rights.
These measures include, inter alia, the ability to permanently ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services.
The data managed are located in Italy. In any case, it is understood that the
Controller
, if necessary, may transfer the data to servers outside Italy; in this case, the Controller hereby ensures that such data will be transferred solely to European Union countries and always in compliance with the applicable legal provisions.
