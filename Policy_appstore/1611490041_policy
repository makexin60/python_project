California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. Please contact us to obtain this information.
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information about them, as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit disclosure of personal information. You have the right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights. To the extent that we collect personal information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below.

You have the right to receive notice of the categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which we use personal information.

Entities to whom we disclose information for business purposes are service providers, which are companies that we engage to conduct activities on our behalf.
Entities to whom we “sell” information are third parties. Under the CCPA, a business “sells” personal information when it discloses personal information to a company for monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party either because we disclose personal information to the company for something other than an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because its contract does not restrict it from using personal information for purposes unrelated to the service it provides to us.
Your rights under the CCPA
• Opt-out of sale of personal information:
You have the right to opt out of our sale of your personal information to third parties. To exercise this right, please visit our
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
link or contact us. Please be aware that your right to opt out does not apply to our disclosure of personal information to service providers.
• Know and request access to and deletion of personal information:
You have the right to request access to personal information collected about you and information regarding the source of that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with to whom we sell or disclose it. You also have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete personal information that we have collected directly from you. Please contact us to exercise these rights.
Financial incentives
We may offer you the opportunity to participate in special promotions and programs from time to time, such as Instant Wins on Twitter and the program we offer may qualify as a financial incentive program (FIP) under California law. We use the Personal Information you provide to enter you into a lottery for a chance to win in-game currency and your participation is voluntary. The category of Personal Information we collect is social media information and gaming account information which we use to facilitate your participation in the program. If we run the program jointly with a business partner, we may disclose the information to that business partner.
You may opt in to Instant Wins using the means we present to you, such as an online registration page, at the time we make the offer. You may opt out of Instant Wins at any time by following the instructions in Section 8 below.
