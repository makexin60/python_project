Additionally, we may collect your information for bug-fixing, analytics to improve our products and services, identifying additional services and functionalities you might need, processing requests for assistance, finding and preventing security problems, fraudulent activity, and violations, optimizing marketing operations (e.g., information on the most-used functionalities), and sending important information (e.g., security notifications).
To Maintain Legal and Regulatory Compliance
OneKey processes your personal information to comply with anti-money laundering and security laws. Additionally, when you use our OneKey Card service, we may request further information to verify your identity or address in collaboration with service providers, as required by law.

Research and development purposes
Improving your experience of our services and sites
Facilitating corporate acquisitions, mergers, or transactions
5. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION
For individuals located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland at the time their personal data is collected, we rely on legal bases for processing your information under the relevant data protection legislation. These bases mean we will only process your data where we are legally required to, where processing is necessary to perform any contracts we entered with you (or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you), for our legitimate interests to operate our business, to protect OneKey or your property rights, or where we have obtained your consent to do so. We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission.

Legal
Personal information about you may be disclosed to law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies, public authorities, or pursuant to the exercise of legal proceedings if we are legally required to do so, or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or request, to enforce our terms and conditions, to prevent or resolve security or technical issues, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OneKey, our Users, a third party, or the public.

At OneKey, we recognize the importance of your personal information and are committed to keeping it safe and secure. Here are three important reasons why you can put your trust in OneKey.
We never sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
When you buy OneKey devices and accessories, the order information is only used as proof of purchase and is deleted voluntarily at the end of the warranty period. This means that your personal information will not be shared with anyone outside of our company and will only be used to complete your transaction.
The serial number on OneKey equipment packaging is only used to identify the production lot and facilitate problem resolution.
We do not link production lots to user information, so even if there is a problem with your product, your personal information will remain anonymous.
At OneKey, we value user privacy and security.
Because our code is 100% open source, anyone who wants to ensure that we are doing everything possible to protect your information can independently review and verify it. We are committed to doing everything possible to protect your privacy.
We are committed to providing you with the most advanced security technology available, while also keeping your personal information private and secure. We value your privacy and are committed to safeguarding it at all times.
Thank you for choosing OneKey. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.
