We take your privacy seriously
Updated 13 March 2018
What information do we collect?
When you join Kanji Garden, you provide an email to identify yourself. This is used to authenticate you, as well as provide notifications that you opt-in to. Some non-personally-identifying information is collected with each signin session, such as browser or operating system version, and date and time of the request. We may also store a push notification token if you opt in to push notifications for that device.
How is this information shared?
Your information is never supplied to any third party except where enforced by law. There are no advertisments or third party tracking software in any part of our service.
How is this information used?
Kanji Garden stores your data as you study, in order to provide data syncing and backup between your devices and sessions. Aggregate information stripped of all personally-identifying information is also examined, in order to improve the quality of service. For example, we may use this data to identify the most incorrectly reviewed items and provide better lesson explanations for them.
Is my information secure?
Your information is accessible only by signing in, which requires direct access your email account. We have taken steps to ensure our databases are kept as secure as we can, and security patches are automatically applied daily to our servers.
How are cookies used?
Kanji Garden does not use cookies. Upon login, your session is cached locally, but cannot identify you outside of the site or app. You may remove all locally stored information at any time by signing out.
Privacy policy changes?
We may change the privacy policy from time to time, but will make our best effort to notify you of any major changes. You are encouraged to check back frequently on this page for any changes. By using Kanji Garden after changes to this privacy policy, you accept any such changes.
