Most of the information we process is information that we have received directly from you.

provide us with during the check-out process, so that you can view your order details online at a later time, even if you did
not complete your purchase.
Data you provide when visiting our website
When you visit a website, you leave a digital footprint. On our website we collect information through website analytics
or other technical means such as cookies and pixels. As a result we receive certain information from you:

Other data you may provide
To assist with your queries, regardless of if you are an existing customer or not, we offer you different ways of getting in
touch with us. You may contact us for many reasons and most of those will include us processing some of your information
as a result. For example:
you can contact us through our web form, per e-mail or by phone. During those requests we will typically process your name,
contact information and whatever message you are sharing with us
we or a refurbisher may ask you to provide identification documents, if there is a dispute related to a delivery

your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation
2.2. Data we generate during the provision of our services
In the process of providing our services to you, we also sometimes generate additional information that
is linked to you. For example, we may
assign your purchases an order number
intercede on your behalf when there is a dispute with a refurbisher and create a record to this effect
tailor our communication to you based on your existing interactions with our services
collect usage information when you visit our website
2.3. Data we receive from other sources

supplement the information you provide us with. For example, we may receive additional information about you when
we conduct risk and fraud prevention processes (in collaboration with our partners)
we interact with partnering logistic providers about the shipment of a good you purchased
you download our app from a third party
3. Understand why we process your data
We process your information in pursuit of creating a great experience for you when you are using our services.
When broken down, parts of your information are processed for different reasons and this impacts how your

We process your data to fulfill our contractual obligations towards you
When you use our platform, you are asking us to connect you with our refurbishers to buy more sustainably and
get great prices at the same time or to offer other services to you that we may offer. To provide you these
services, it is necessary for us to process some of your information. This also includes the steps you take
leading up to entering into a contract with us. For example, we have to process some of your personal information when :
you make a purchase,
you create a user account

We process your data when you have given your explicit consent
We work hard to make your experience on our platform the best it can be. Some of our efforts, for which we may
use your information, are not strictly necessary to your use of our service, so we will ask for your permission
to make sure that you are okay with this. For example, we will, with your permission, process some of your
personal information when:
you sign up to our newsletter or other direct marketing efforts
you agree to optional cookies and analytics in our cookie banner (make sure to read our Cookie Policy!)

We process your data when we are required to do so by law
Just like everyone else, we are subject to rules and laws, depending on where we are located, which countries we

information. For example, we will process some of your personal information to comply with:
general record keeping and accounting obligations in connection with sales on our platform
reporting obligations in connection with our Trade-in program
processing obligations connected to the exercise of your rights (including your data subject requests)
We process your data when we have a legitimate interest to do so
If we process information that does not qualify for any of the categories described above, we do so on the basis of
our legitimate interest as a company. This helps us improve our service and create a safe and enjoyable experience
for our users. We will only rely on our legitimate interest when we are convinced that this can be reconciled with
your interests, rights or fundamental freedoms (including your right to privacy). For example, we will process some
of your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of:
analyzing how our plattform is used by you
improving how our customer service assists you
collecting your feedback through ratings or services
personalizing how you engage with our website
reaching out to you through direct marketing measures (where we do not rely on your consent)
