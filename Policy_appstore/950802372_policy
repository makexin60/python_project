3.2 If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we
      rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to
      process your personal information:
- Consent.
We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal
      information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more
      about withdrawing your consent.

- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to
        the production of records

      INFORMATION?" above), in the United States, and other countries.
5.2 If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these

      your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance
      with this privacy notice and applicable law.
5.3 We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European
      Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group

      notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
      requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
      will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
      information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
      isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
7.1 We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
      protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
      secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
      guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
      unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify
      your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
      information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
      environment.

      withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW
      CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. However, please note that this will not affect the
      lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing
      of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. If you have
      questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at support@instalogocreator.com.
9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
9.1 Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
      ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
      browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
      implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or
      any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
      online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
      version of this privacy notice.
10. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

      will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you

      Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that
      information from our servers. If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and

      that information.

Before you lodge a complaint with us
Complain to the organisation or agency first
If you’re concerned your
personal information
has been mishandled, you first need to
complain to the organisation or agency
you think has mishandled it. If they don’t respond to your complaint within 30 days or you’re not happy with their response, you can lodge a complaint with us.
Check if you can complain to an external dispute resolution scheme
Before making a complaint with us, you may be able to complain to an external dispute resolution (EDR) scheme that may be able to help with your complaint as well as consider non-privacy issues. We recognise EDR schemes that can help with a privacy-related complaint about:
an electricity, gas or water provider (in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria or Western Australia)
a
financial service provider
public transport (in Victoria)
a telecommunications provider
tolling (in New South Wales, Queensland or Victoria).
For example, you would contact the Australian Financial Complaints Authority if your complaint is about how a bank mishandled your personal information and the financial services they gave you. They may be able help you with your privacy-related complaint as well as handle broader, non-privacy related issues about the financial service they gave you that we can’t help with.

the EDR schemes we recognise
and the type of privacy-related complaints they handle.

Making a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner
Your rights
Our Office values working with New Zealanders to get their privacy queries and complaints sorted quickly and fairly. Before you complain to us, you need to complain directly to the business or organisation that has breached your privacy.
How complaining to us works
If you haven’t been able to work out your privacy issue with the business or organisation you complained to, then you can complain to us.
First, we’ll decide whether we need to investigate. We will base that decision on the information you provide, so it’s helpful to set out a short explanation for what your key concern is and include only relevant documents. If we decide to investigate, we may first talk to you and sometimes to the
agency
you’re complaining about.
Read our decision guide
.
We will try to accommodate any accessibility needs you have
when contacting us
in accordance with the
Human Rights Act 1993.
Reasons we won't investigate
There are many reasons we won’t investigate (some are listed below) but even if we decide we can’t, we’ll still give you a chance to comment.
Some common reasons we won’t investigate are:
You haven't contacted the organisation first
You should give the business or organisation a chance to resolve your problem first and should wait at least 30 working days for a response before contacting us.
Your complaint is about an old issue
If your complaint is about something that happened more than 12 months ago, we probably won’t investigate it unless there’s a good reason why you didn’t contact us earlier.
The issue hasn't caused you harm
We’ll only investigate a breach of your privacy if it’s caused you
harm.
The agency has taken appropriate steps to resolve the issue
If an agency has already acted, changing its systems, and apologising to the person concerned, we’d likely consider those actions that would resolve the complaint. An investigation isn’t likely to achieve a different outcome.
Section 74 of the Privacy Act
has a full list of reasons we might not investigate your complaint and includes things like the complaint being a breach of someone else’s privacy, or there being a better way to sort it out.
Complaining to us with courtesy and consideration
We take the health and safety and wellbeing of our staff seriously and have some rules of engagement that we’d like you to know about.
You can expect us to:
treat you courteously and with respect
answer your questions about our process
keep you informed about your complaint and when you can expect to hear back from us.
We expect you to:
treat us with courtesy
co-operate with our process and requests for information
correspond with our staff politely and in a way that maintains staff wellbeing
accept that we will not tolerate rude or abusive behaviour or correspondence that undermines staff wellbeing
understand that we have a zero-tolerance approach to threats made to OPC staff.
As an agency that deals with human rights, we value feedback. However, harmful communications to OPC staff – such as abusive or offensive comments and harassment – are never acceptable and may result in the Office declining to investigate your complaint.
Read our service charter that explains this in more detail
.
OPC takes the safety and wellbeing of our staff seriously
Violence or threats of violence are not tolerated, and we will respond accordingly. This may include issuing a warning, limiting access to our services, reporting a matter of concern to the Police, or issuing a trespass notice. OPC may use or disclose your personal information to the Police or to a complaints body, to report threats of violence or offensive communications. This will be done as it is necessary for the safety and wellbeing of our staff.
Read our policy for responding to threats to staff safety
.
Inappropriate or offensive communication with our staff may result in a warning or may mean that we are not able to deal with your complaint.
This includes:
abusive or offensive comments or threats to OPC staff
intimidation or harassment of OPC staff by phone or email
inappropriate questions to OPC staff or referencing non-relevant OPC staff personal information
threats to defame OPC staff or to publish personal information about OPC staff
posting personal information about OPC staff online, including any communication that breaches the communication principles in the
Harmful Digital Communications Act
.
What we can't do
Our role is to decide if there’s been a breach of the Privacy Act and help both the groups come to a decision. We can't force organisations to pay you money, issue fines, make anyone accept a settlement offer, or force anyone to accept our findings.
Getting your personal information corrected
If you make a request to an agency about accessing or correcting your personal information, they must respond to that within 20 working days. Any agency may, in limited circumstances, extend the 20-working day timeframe, but they must tell you why, and let you know when they’ll give you the information. You can use our response calculator on the left to work out the latest date an agency must respond to you by.
One person complaining on behalf of many
When lots of people are affected by one privacy breach,
the Privacy Act
allows for one person to make a complaint to us on behalf of many (as a class). When this happens, the Privacy Commissioner can begin an investigation themselves.
Giving someone authority to act on your behalf
If you want someone to act on your behalf (like an advocate, a family member, or lawyer) you will need to complete a form that tells us that in writing.
