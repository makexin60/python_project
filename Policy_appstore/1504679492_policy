We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Once your messages (including your chats, photos, videos, voice messages, files, and share location information) are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. Your messages are stored on your own device. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 90 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 90 days, we delete it. To improve performance and deliver media messages more efficiently, such as when many people are sharing a popular photo or video, we may retain that content on our servers for a longer period of time. We also offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.
Your Connections
You can use the contact upload feature and provide us, if permitted by applicable laws, with the phone numbers in your address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information for you in a way that ensures those contacts cannot be identified by us. You can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information. You give your groups a name. You can provide a group profile picture or description.
We refer to those contacts as “Connections”. Learn more about our contact upload feature below:
Contact upload is an optional feature that allows us to identify which of your contacts in your device’s address book are also Toki users so that we can add them to your Toki contacts, and quickly update your Toki contacts in case your contacts who are not yet using Toki sign up later. It’s important to note that Toki does not share your contacts with any other third party. Your version of Toki on your device will display the names for your Toki contacts from your device’s address book so that you can easily connect with them.

Toki enables certain information to be shared publicly with your Toki contacts and other users of Toki. At any time, you can hide your profile from the public search by unchecking “allow search by a display name” in your account settings.
