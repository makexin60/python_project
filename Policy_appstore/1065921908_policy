i. Device features
When using the app and to enhance the use, functionalities and your experience while you use our App we might need access to certain extra information and functions of your device, like your contact list. Before accessing such information, we will ask for your permission. Any data obtained by utilizing these device features will be stored only on your device, never on our server or elsewhere.
You can choose to add your contacts' information by connecting your contacts from your device or social networking accounts to our App. If you choose to share your contacts with us, we will, in accordance with your instructions, access and store your contacts' information in our App in order to make it easier to send money to your loved ones. Learn more about how we collect information about your contacts, how we use that information, and the controls available to you.
j) Contact list
When you allow the App to access your device’s address book, the App will upload their names and phones numbers to your contact list within the App. This way, once you are selecting a beneficiary, you will be able to select someone from your contact list without the need of having to include all their information digit by digit.
As mentioned above, we will only access your device’s contact list as long as you give us express consent. You may give us access during the registration process or at any point after your account has been created in the settings option.
If after allowing the App to access your contact list, you change your opinion, you will always be able to remove your contact list from the App. Remember that the imported list of your contact details will never leave your phone and we will never store a copy of that data in our servers.
1.1 Biometric Data and e-KYC
We are legally obligated to check your identity via a process known as e-KYC (electronic Know Your Customer) to exclusively identify you and prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud schemes as required by anti-money laundering legislation. We will ask you to provide a valid photo identity document, a video recording and/or a selfie during the onboarding process when you register for Ria online services on the Ria mobile application or web application. You will be asked to provide these directly in our service providers’ platforms.
This process and information help us identify suspicious activities. It will also allow us to provide you with a better Service.
The selfie, video recording (if requested) and the derived data such as the face scan template may be considered biometric data or biometric information by the local legislation in the jurisdiction in which we operate. Depending on the country you live in, we may ask you to consent to providing us with your biometric data. If you refuse to consent to the collection of your biometric information please reach our customer care team so they can support the identity verification process via an alternative method. You will find the
contact information here
.
We share the biometric information with our service providers under contractual obligations. Neither Ria nor our service providers sell, lease, or trade your biometric information. All providers with access to this data are contractually bound to maintain security standards to ensure your Biometric information is safe and that the service provider will not use the data for any other purpose.  This includes preventing unauthorized parties from accessing such data.
Subject to the applicable privacy legislation, your data privacy rights relating to your personal data also extend to biometric data, including the right to access the data. Please see section “What are my rights” in this Privacy Notice for a listing of your data privacy rights.
If You have any questions regarding our e-KYC process and the usage of your Biometrics do not hesitate to reach us at
dpo@euronetworldwide.com
.
If you are using our Services in any of our shops, the KYC process will be different and the agent or any of our staff will make sure the ID you provide matches your identity.
When using our signature pads at our shops or at any agent's location, we will only collect the image of your signature as reflected on the signature pad, and no biometric data will be collected from you.
1.3 Personal Data of a Beneficiary
If you are a beneficiary, we collect your Personal Data from our customers as you are essential for the performance of a contract between Ria and our customer. You are the subject that will benefit from the payment transaction originated by our customer.
The types of Personal Data we may obtain about you are as follows:
Identification Personal Data (In accordance with section 1)
Transactional Data (In accordance with section 1)
Financial Data (In accordance with section 1)
The legal basis for processing the Personal Data of a beneficiary is our legitimate interest in fulfilling our obligations related to the contractual relationship we have with our customer.
The Personal Data of a beneficiary is only processed to ensure the correct remittance service is identified and is not used for any other purposes. The same security measures are implemented to protect the Personal Data of both beneficiaries and customers.
If you have any questions about the processing of your Personal Data as a beneficiary, you may contact us at
dpo@euronetworldwide.com

1.4 Personal Data Collected from Other Parties
We may obtain your Personal Data from other sources, such as public record sources (federal, state or local government organizations) in order to comply with local regulation and to ensure our KYC mechanism is accurate and that we can provide you the safest service.
Personal Data collected from third parties is only processed for specific purposes, such as:

If you notice that your Personal Data is not accurate, you may request a correction or update your information by sending an email to

1.6 Machine Learning
One of the primary purposes of machine learning usage within Ria is to support the digital e-KYC verification process required by anti-money laundering legislation.
The biometric information uploaded by you is analyzed to provide a recommendation on whether the individual wishing to register for Ria Services is the same individual shown in the identification documentation. The technology scans the images, translates them into computer language, i.e.: templates, and compares them against each other and against a database of other images. The technology approves or rejects the images as being of the same person.
2. Fraud Preention
Ria has also developed its own machine learning models to support its overall regulatory compliance efforts such as identifying instances of transactional fraud. This analysis is to ensure we can provide you with the solicited Services and to comply with our legal requirements, in order to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.
The process includes analyzing transactional data and assigning values to specific information. These values are then aggregated and passed to the machine learning model to infer whether the transaction is likely to be fraud.
All the information obtained through our machine learning process will only be used for the purposes described herein and will never be used for any other purposes nor will it affect your rights and freedoms.
For more information on Euronet’s use of machine learning technology please contact Euronet DPO at
dpo@euronetworldwide.com

If you haven’t been able to work out your privacy issue with them,
then you can complain to us
