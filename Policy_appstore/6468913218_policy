www.selmo.io
website (hereinafter: Website).

§ 3. Information on purposes and legal basis of processing
If you are our customers (i.e. persons who have or have had an account at Selmo) your data will be processed for the purpose of entering into and performing the contract concluded with you for the use of Selmo (the legal basis for processing in this case is article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR), for the purpose of performing our legal obligations, in particular with regard to tax law (e.g. in order to collect the documentation required by tax law and to make settlements in respect of taxes and fees) (the legal basis for processing in this case is article 6(1)(c) GDPR), as well as in order to fulfil our legitimate interest which should be understood as: establishment, exercise or defence of mutual claims, conducting internal reporting and administration, and conducting marketing activities regarding our own services (the legal basis for processing in this case is article 6(1)(f) GDPR). This data will be processed until the end of this cooperation and for the period necessary for the statute of limitations for any mutual civil law claims and tax liabilities (this will normally be a period of five years from the end of the year in which the contract was terminated).
If you have consented via our website to the use of cookies for marketing, advertising and analytical purposes, your data will be processed in order to pursue our legitimate interest which should be understood as marketing our own services (the legal basis in this case is article 6(1)(f) GDPR). Your data will be processed until you withdraw these consents or object to further processing, but for no longer than two years from the date of your last visit to the Website. However, normally this data will not allow us to identify you, although it may be treated as personal data under the GDPR.
If you are persons employed by our (also potential) customers (including their employees, subcontractors, attorneys, representatives) and perform tasks related to our cooperation with them, your personal data will be processed for the purpose of entering into and performing contracts with these entities, for the establishment, exercise or defence of possible mutual claims, and conducting marketing activities regarding our own services. The legal basis will be the pursuit of our legitimate interest within the meaning of article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. This data will be processed until the end of this cooperation and for the period necessary for the statute of limitations for any mutual civil law claims and tax liabilities (this will normally be a period of five years from the end of the year in which the contract ceased).
If you contact us by email and there is no other case as mentioned above, your data will be processed in order to pursue our legitimate interest in responding to this enquiry (the legal basis in this case is article 6(1)(f) GDPR). This data will be stored at the latest until the end of the year following the year in which the correspondence was completed.
If you use Selmo or the Website, your data will be processed for our legitimate interest that should be understood as ensuring that Selmo and the Website can be administered and that unauthorised access is detected and protected against. The legal basis for this is article 6(1)(f) GDPR. This data will be automatically collected, i.a. the IP address of your computer, the subpages visited, the time of access, the type of browser, any transmission errors, the address of the previously visited page (if entered through a link). In most cases, this data does not identify you as an individual, although it may be regarded as personal data under the GDPR. They are stored for an indefinite period of time.

If you are a user of such a platform, the processing of your personal data is also subject to such rules and policies and you may exercise your rights under them.

§ 8. Analytical and marketing tools
We use the Facebook Custom Audiences tool, part of which is the so-called Pixel, a tracking code installed on our Website. The tool is provided by companies in the Meta group (i.e. primarily Meta Platforms Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland), which automatically collects data on users' use of the portal in order for us to target them with personalised Facebook and Instagram advertisements (i.e. based on analysis of their behaviour). The Pixel tool is used by the portal to display advertising to those users of Facebook and Instagram (as well as of other services participating in the Facebook Audience Network) who have expressed an interest in our Website (as part of so-called remarketing) or who have characteristics that may indicate a potential interest in the Website (e.g. specific interests). Using the tool, we can also create groups of similar audiences (people with statistically similar characteristics to our existing audiences or portal users), to which we display our adverts. The tool also allows us to measure the effectiveness of ads placed on Facebook. Facebook may also use the above-described data (e.g. about your visit to our Website) independently of us for its own purposes, and may also associate your usage data with previously collected data about you. Within the framework of the cookie settings of your browser, you may decide not to use the tool in your case. It is also possible to manage your privacy settings within your Facebook profile. You can read about the detailed scope of data processing at: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation and https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616. You can manage your Facebook ad settings at: https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen
We use Hotjar. This is a tool provided by a company (Hotjar Ltd, Level 2, St Julian's Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julian's STJ 1000, Malta) which allows us to analyse your behaviour on the Website by creating heatmaps, recording user movements on the site, conversion paths, surveys and user feedback. Hotjar compiles information about how users use the Website and this information is generated through tracking code and cookies and is then transferred to and stored on Hotjar's servers. The Hotjar code may collect the following types of data: the IP address in encoded form, the email address and the first name and family name of the user, the type of device with its parameters, the type of browser and the country from which the visit to the Website or Application took place. The cookies used by Hotjar are stored for a maximum of 1 year. To deactivate the use of the Hotjar tool towards you, visit:
https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out
.
We use the Splitbee tool provided by Tobias Lins e.U., (Alserbachstraße 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria). This is an analytical tool that allows us to understand the behaviour of our users by creating statistics. It automatically collects data on how visitors behave on our Website (e.g. how long they spend on individual pages, which links they click on, etc.), as well as data on language, location, operating system used, etc. The tool operator does not combine the data collected on our Website with other data it may have on you due to your use of other websites using Splitbee. For more information, please visit:
https://splitbee.io/privacy
§ 9. Processing the personal data entrusted to Selmo
If you are a person who purchases from our customers using Selmo and we do not have any direct legal relationship, this data is processed in connection with the entrustment of processing the personal data by our customers to us on the basis of the relevant contracts or other legal instruments.
If, in the case referred to in paragraph 1, you send us inquiries in matters relating to your personal data, we will forward your request to the entity that has entrusted us with the data and is the data controller within the meaning of the GDPR, informing you of this.

The new Microsoft Edge
helps you browse, search, shop online, and more. Like all modern browsers, Microsoft Edge lets you collect and store specific data on your device, like cookies, and lets you send information to us, like browsing history, to make the experience as rich, fast, and personal as possible.
Whenever we collect data, we want to make sure it’s the right choice for you. Some people worry about their web browsing history being collected. That’s why we tell you what data is stored on your device or collected by us. We give you choices to control what data gets collected. For more information about privacy in Microsoft Edge, we recommend reviewing our
Privacy Statement
.
What data is collected or stored, and why
Microsoft uses diagnostic data to improve our products and services. We use this data to better understand how our products are performing and where improvements need to be made.
Microsoft Edge collects a set of required diagnostic data to keep Microsoft Edge secure, up to date and performing as expected. Microsoft believes in and practices information collection minimization. We strive to gather only the info we need, and to store it only for as long as it’s needed to provide a service or for analysis. In addition, you can control whether optional diagnostic data associated with your device is shared with Microsoft to solve product issues and help improve Microsoft products and services.
As you use features and services in Microsoft Edge, diagnostic data about how you use those features is sent to Microsoft. Microsoft Edge saves your browsing history—information about websites you visit—on your device. Depending on your settings, this browsing history is sent to Microsoft, which helps us find and fix problems and improve our products and services for all users. You can manage the collection of optional diagnostic data in the browser by selecting

Help improve Microsoft products by sending optional diagnostic data about how you use the browser, websites you visit, and crash reports
. This includes data from testing new experiences. To finish making changes to this setting, restart Microsoft Edge.
Turning this setting on allows this optional diagnostic data to be shared with Microsoft from other applications using Microsoft Edge, such as a video streaming app that hosts the Microsoft Edge web platform to stream the video. The Microsoft Edge web platform will send info about how you use the web platform and sites you visit in the application to Microsoft.  This data collection is determined by your optional diagnostic data setting in Privacy, search, and services settings in Microsoft Edge.
On Windows 10, these settings are determined by your Windows diagnostic setting. To change your diagnostic data setting, select

As of
March 6th 2024,
Microsoft Edge diagnostic data is collected separately from Windows diagnostic data on Windows 10 (version 22H2 and newer) and Windows 11 (version 23H2 and newer) devices in the European Economic Area. For these Windows versions, and on all other platforms, you can change your settings in Microsoft Edge by selecting

Show me search and site suggestions using my typed characters
. As you start to type, the info you enter in the address bar is sent to your default search provider to give you immediate search and website suggestions.
When you use InPrivate browsing or guest mode, Microsoft Edge collects some info about how you use the browser depending on your Windows diagnostic data setting or Microsoft Edge privacy settings, but automatic suggestions are turned off and info about websites you visit is not collected. Microsoft Edge will delete your browsing history, cookies, and site data, as well as passwords, addresses, and form data when you close all InPrivate windows. You can start a new InPrivate session by selecting

Microsoft Edge also has features to help you and your content stay safe online. Windows Defender SmartScreen automatically blocks websites and content downloads that are reported to be malicious. Windows Defender SmartScreen checks the address of the webpage you're visiting against a list of webpage addresses stored on your device that Microsoft believes to be legitimate. Addresses that aren't on your device’s list and the addresses of files you're downloading will be sent to Microsoft and checked against a frequently updated list of webpages and downloads that have been reported to Microsoft as unsafe or suspicious.
To speed up tedious tasks like filling out forms and entering passwords, Microsoft Edge can save info to help. If you choose to use those features, Microsoft Edge stores the info on your device. If you’ve turned on sync for form fill like addresses or passwords, this info will be sent to the Microsoft cloud and stored with your Microsoft account to be synced across all your signed-in versions of Microsoft Edge.

To integrate your browsing experience with other activities you do on your device, Microsoft Edge shares your browsing history with Microsoft Windows through its Indexer. This information is stored locally on the device. It includes URLs, a category in which the URL might be relevant, such as “most visited”, “recently visited”, or “recently closed”, and also a relative frequency or recency within each category. Websites you visit while in InPrivate mode will not be shared. This information is then available to other applications on the device, such as the start menu or taskbar.

To protect some video and music content from being copied, some streaming websites store Digital Rights Management (DRM) data on your device, including a unique identifier (ID) and media licenses. When you go to one of these websites, it retrieves the DRM info to make sure you have permission to use the content.
Microsoft Edge also stores cookies, small files that are put on your device as you browse the web.
