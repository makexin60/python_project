            questions, and keep that information current.

            inquiries we consider necessary to validate your and your company’s identity and information. This may

            provided in these Terms. We will not be liable to you for any losses that you incur in connection with our
            closure or suspension of your account.
3. Sending and Receiving Payments
3.1 Payment Purpose:
You warrant and represent that your use of the Services is solely to
            make
            remittance payments or payments for goods and services as permitted under these Terms.
3.2 Payment Limits:
The amount of funds you can send or receive may be restricted based on a
            risk
            assessment and the amount of verification on your User Account. We may limit the dollar amount of transfers,
            on a per transaction or cumulative basis.
3.3 Payment Review:
We review and monitor payment transactions for risk, fraud, money
            laundering and
            terrorist financing activity. For certain potentially high-risk transactions, we will place a hold on the
            payment, conduct a review, may contact you for additional information, and either clear or cancel the
            payment. To prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may place a delay on a payment for a period of time,
            refuse to process a payment, or deactivate your User Account. If we have reason to suspect that you are
            using the Services to violate local, state or federal laws, we may share information about you with law
            enforcement agencies.
3.4 Refused and Refunded Transactions:
When you send money, the receiver is not required to
            accept it.
            You agree that you will not hold us liable for any damages resulting from a receiver’s decision not to
            accept a payment made through the Services. Any unclaimed, refunded or denied payment will be returned to
            your bank account. Unless provided for sooner under your agreement with Whish, we will return any unclaimed
            payment to you within 30 Days of the date you initiated payment. To be eligible for a refund, a transaction
            must not have been fulfilled by any statutory refund timelines.
3.5 Insufficient Funds and Reversals:
When you send or receive a payment, you are liable to
            us for the
            full amount of the payment plus any Pricing if the payment is later invalidated for any reason (e.g.
            insufficient funds from sender). This means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be
            responsible to us for the amount of the payment, plus the applicable Pricing if there is a reversal of the
            payment. You agree to allow us to recover any amounts due to us by debiting your bank account. If there are
            insufficient funds in your bank account to cover your liability, you agree to reimburse us immediately, upon
            demand, through other means. You agree to reimburse us for any fees imposed on us or costs we incur as a
            result of the transaction. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of
            these Terms. You are liable for any of our costs associated with collection in addition to any amounts owed,
            including attorneys’ fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest. Your liability
            under this Section extends to any of your guarantors, successors and assigns.
3.6 Refund and Reversal Currencies:
All refunds and reversals will be made in the same
            currency as the
            original transaction. If your transaction must be refunded or reversed and you do not have the correct
            currency available in your bank account, a currency conversion will be performed.
3.7 Payment Processing Delays:
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process and
            facilitate
            your payment in accordance with these Terms and applicable law. When you send a payment to a receiver, the
            payment is treated as authorization to process your payment and complete the transaction. Some receivers may
            delay claiming your payment, in which case the payment may be held as pending until the receiver claims your
            payment. We will cancel the transaction within 30 Days of the date you initiated payment in accordance with
            Section 3.4.
3.8 Errors Regarding Payments:
It is your responsibility to review all payment transactions
            initiated
            through the Services. Your payment transaction information is maintained in your User Account and included
            in the receipts we provide you. We will rectify any of our processing errors that we discover. If the error
            results in a receiver’s receipt of less than the correct amount to which a receiver is entitled, we will
            credit their account for the difference. If the error results in their receipt of more than the correct
            amount to which a receiver is entitled, we will debit the extra funds from their account.
3.9 Your Liability for Unauthorized Transactions:
An “Unauthorized Transaction” occurs when
            an EFT
            payment is made using your Login Credentials, and you neither authorized that payment nor benefited from the
            payment. Please note, however, if you give someone access to your Login Credentials and they process a
            transaction, this will not be considered an Unauthorized Transaction, even if that person uses your Login
            Credentials without your permission, unless you previously notified Veem that you shared your credentials
            with someone who isn’t authorized to use your account so that we could take appropriate action.
To help you protect yourself against unauthorized activity and monitor your account and transactions in real
            time, we provide you with a full transaction history for your account that can be accessed at any time from
            any device through your Whish account. This transaction history includes: the amount, date and type of each
            payment made through your account; the payment account(s) used; and information about the payor and payee.
            The transaction history will also provide you with contact information for the customer care team in case
            you have any questions or concerns about a transaction. We recommend that you regularly log in to your Whish
            account to review your transaction history.
You must TELL WHISH AT ONCE if you believe your Login Credentials have been lost or stolen, or your Whish
            account has been otherwise compromised, or if you believe that an Unauthorized Transaction has been made
            from your account. If you tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Login
            Credentials or of the compromise of your Whish account, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your
            Login Credentials or account without your permission. If you do NOT tell us within 2 business days after you
            learn of the loss or theft of your Login Credentials or of the compromise of your Whish account, and we can
            prove we could have stopped someone from using your Login Credentials or Whish account if you had told us
            within 2 business days, you could lose as much as $500.
If you believe there is an Unauthorized Transaction on your account, you must tell us AT ONCE, but at least
            within 60 days of the transfer posting to your Whish payment history. If you do NOT tell us within 60 days
            of the Unauthorized Transaction, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove
            that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. If a good reason (such
            as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us about the loss or theft of your Login
            Credentials or the compromise of your Veem account, or about an Unauthorized Transaction on your account, we
            will extend the time periods above.
If you believe that your Login Credentials have been lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, or you believe
            there may be an Unauthorized Transaction you must contact us IMMEDIATELY through our customer support..
3.10 Funds in Settlement Process:
Veem uses bank accounts to help fulfill payments. Funds in
            the
            payment settlement process may be stored in a master bank account owned by Veem, as custodian and for the
            benefit of Veem customers. Such funds may be commingled with other funds similarly collected by and held by
            Veem for purposes of making payments requested through the Service. Even though funds will be held in an
            account owned by Veem, the funds are held solely for the benefit of the Veem users, not Veem and the Veem
            user will be the principal with respect to those funds. Veem will not mix user funds with Veem corporate
            funds and Veem will not use customer funds for any corporate purposes, nor will Veem voluntarily make
            customer funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Funds will be held in U.S. dollars.
            You will not receive interest on the funds that Veem holds on your behalf.
3.11 Error Resolution Notice:
Under federal law, we are required to address errors in the
            following manner:
If you believe there is an Unauthorized Transaction or other error, or if you need more information about
            your account to determine if there is an Unauthorized Transaction or other error on your account, contact
            Whish through the customer support portal AS SOON AS YOU CAN. We must hear from you no later than 60 days
            after the transfer or error posted to the payment history on your Whish Account.
We will investigate and, where appropriate, resolve any suspected error that you report within 60 days of the
            error posting to your Whish account. We may also investigate and/or resolve suspected errors that are
            reported after 60 Business days of posting to your Whish account, in our sole discretion.
When you contact us, be prepared, if possible, to:
(1)
Tell us your name and account number (if any).
(2)
Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as
                you can why you
                believe it is an error or why you need more information.
(3)
Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10
            business days.
We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct
            any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 business days to investigate your
            complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 10 business days for the
            amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete
            our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it
            within 10 business days, we may not credit your account.
For errors involving new accounts or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 business days to
            investigate your complaint or question. For new accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to credit your
            account for the amount you think is in error.
We will tell you the results within three (3) business days after completing our investigation. If we decided
            that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents
            that we used in our investigation
For purposes of this Agreement, an error includes the following:
An Unauthorized Transaction.
You send a payment through the Service and an incorrect amount is debited from your account.
An EFT payment does not appear in your account transaction history.
An EFT payment does not appear correctly in your account transaction history.
Your request for information about your account related to an EFT transaction(s), including for information
            needed to determine whether an error has occurred.

You request account or transaction documentation related to an EFT payment documentation, other than a
            request for a duplicate copy, a request for tax or recordkeeping purposes or a request for a paper copy when
            you have consented to electronic delivery.
An error does not include the following:
Your request for account or transaction documentation related to an EFT payment documentation if that request
            is for a duplicate copy, for tax or recordkeeping purposes, or for a paper copy when you have consented to
            electronic delivery.
4. Changes to the Service
We will occasionally provide automatic upgrades to the Services and its functionality to improve your
            experience, although these upgrades may not be consistent across all platforms and devices. You agree to
            take no action to interfere with such automatic upgrades and changes to the Services. We have the right at
            any time to change, modify, add to, discontinue or retire any aspect or feature of the Services including,
            but not limited to, the hours of availability, equipment needed for access or use, the maximum or minimum
            settlement amounts or the availability of the Services on any particular device or platform. We have no
            obligation but will make a reasonable effort to provide you with notice of any such changes.
5. General Provisions

            Processors (collectively, “Veem Parties”) from and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage,

            person or entity that arises out of or relates to any transaction submitted by you through the Services.
5.2 Limitation of Liability:
In no event will Veem Parties be liable for any lost profits,
            lost
            revenue, lost business opportunity, loss of data, or any indirect, punitive, incidental, special,

            Services, including without limitation the use of, inability to use, or unavailability of the Services.
            Under no circumstances will any of the Veem Parties be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting
            from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or your User Account or the data
            contained therein, or your failure to use or implement security, controls, or processes that are appropriate
            for your business.
Veem Parties assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) personal injury or property damage, of any
            nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of the Services; (b) any misuse of Services or data;
            (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Services; (d) any software bugs, viruses,
            or other harmful code that may be transmitted to or through the Services; (e) any errors, inaccuracies, or
            omissions in the Services or data, or any loss or damage resulting therefrom (other than the transfer amount
            and the transfer fees charged directly by Veem, for which Veem will be responsible), regardless of the
            manner of transmission; or (f) defamatory, offensive, or (subject to our obligation to safeguard funds in
            our care) illegal conduct of any third party;. or (g) being prevented from, hindered or delayed by reason of

            in its performance under these Terms of Use (e.g. “Force Majeure” events).
The Veem Parties’ cumulative liability to you is limited to direct damages and in all events will not exceed
            in the aggregate amounts actually received by us (including any Pricing paid to us) for providing the
            Services to you during the three (3) month period immediately preceding the event that gives rise to the
            claim for liability (in addition to refunding the transfer amount and transfer fee). This limitation of
            liability section applies regardless of the legal theory that the claim is based on, including without
            limitation contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other basis. The limitations
            apply even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage.
5.3 No Warranty Disclaimer:
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION
            OF
            WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. VEEM, OUR PARENT AND AFFILIATES, AND THE OFFICERS,
            DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS OF VEEM, OUR PARENT OR OUR AFFILIATES,
            SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
            NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the
            Services, and operation of our site may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. We
            will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank
            accounts are processed in a timely manner but we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount
            of time needed to complete processing because the Services are dependent upon many factors outside of our
            control, such as delays in the banking system. Certain Services may not be available to you based on
            residency, geographic location or other eligibility criteria. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of
            implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you. This paragraph gives you specific
            legal rights and you may also have other legal rights that vary from state to state.
5.4 Entire Agreement:
These Terms and all policies and procedures that are incorporated by
            reference
            constitute the entire agreement between you and us for provision and use of the Services. Except where
            expressly stated otherwise in a writing executed between you and us, these Terms will prevail over any
            conflicting policy or agreement for the provision or use of the Services. These Terms sets forth your
            exclusive remedies with respect to the Services. If any provision or portion of these Terms is held to be
            invalid or unenforceable under law, then it will be reformed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of
            such provision to the greatest extent possible, and all remaining provisions will continue in full force and
            effect.
5.5 Applicable Law:
You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by
            federal law
            and except as otherwise stated in these Terms, the laws of the State of California, without regard to
            principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may
            arise between you and us.
5.6 Assignment:
You may not transfer or assign any rights or obligations you have under
            these Terms
            without our prior written consent. We reserve the right to transfer or assign these Terms or any right or
            obligation under these Terms at any time. These Terms shall inure to the benefit of all permitted successors
            and assigns.
5.7 Force Majeure:
Neither we nor you will be liable for any delays in processing or other
            nonperformance caused by telecommunications, utility, failures, or equipment failures; labor strife, riots,
            war, or terrorist attacks; nonperformance of our vendors or suppliers, fires or acts of nature; or any other
            event over which we have no reasonable control. However, nothing in this section will affect or excuse your
            liabilities or your obligation to pay fees, reversals, or returns under this Agreement.
5.8 Taxes:
You are responsible for determining any and all Taxes assessed, incurred, or
            required to be
            collected, paid, or withheld for any reason for your use of the Services (“Taxes”). You also are solely
            responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax
            authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect,
            report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. We specifically disclaim any
            liability for Taxes.
5.9 Severability:
In the event that any provision contained herein shall for any reason be
            held
            invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, to such extent such
            provision shall be deemed null and void and severed from these Terms, the remainder hereof shall remain in
            full force and effect and enforceable.
5.10 Independent Contractor:
We are an independent contractor for all purposes. Except as
            otherwise
            provided herein, neither we nor you have any right or authority to assume any obligations, or to make any
            representations or warranties, whether express or implied, on each other’s behalf, or to bind each other in
            any matter.
5.11 Survival:
The following shall survive the termination of these Term: (i) all
            liabilities accrued
            under these Terms prior to the effective date of termination; (ii) all provisions that give rise to a
            party’s ongoing obligation; (iii) all provisions of Sections 1.2, 2.5, 2.8. 3.4, 3.6 and 5.1 through 5.13 of
            these Terms of Use; and (iv) any other terms which by their nature should survive.
5.12 Compliance with Laws:
You represent and warrant that you will comply (and will cause
            your
            employees, agents, and representatives to comply) with all laws applicable to your business and the
            Services. Use of the Services is subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding the prevention of
            terrorist financing and anti-money laundering. You agree and acknowledge that your use of the Services will
            comply with such laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the sanctions programs administered by
            the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury.
5.13. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration:
a. Generally:
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Veem in the most
            expedient and
            cost-effective manner, you and Veem agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be
            resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
            neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court and can be
            subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can
            award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of
            these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory
            and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
            AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND VEEM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
            PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
b. Exceptions:
Despite the provisions of Section 5.13(a), nothing in these Terms will be
            deemed to
            waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to (i) bring an individual action in small
            claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if
            that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of
            law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
c. Arbitrator:
Any arbitration between you and Veem will be settled under the U.S. Federal
            Arbitration
            Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for
            Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as
            modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available
            online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
d. Notice Process:
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice
            of the
            dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if
            such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). Veem’s
            address for Notice is: Veem Inc., 1160 Battery St. East, Suite 100, San Francisco CA 94111; Attention: Legal
            Department. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth
            the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim
            directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received,
            you or Veem may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
            offer made by you or Veem must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final
            decision and award if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Veem will
            pay you the highest of the following: (A) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; or B) the last
            written settlement amount offered by Veem in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.
e. No Class Actions:
YOU AND VEEM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
            YOUR OR
            ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
            PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Veem agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
            one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
f. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision:
If Veem makes any future change to this
            arbitration
            provision, other than a change to Veem’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written
            notice within 30 days of the change to Veem’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Veem will
            be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you
            rejected will survive.
g. Enforceability:
If Section 5.14a is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this
            Section
            5.14 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 5.15 will be null and void and, in that
            case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in these Terms will govern any
            action arising out of or related to these Terms.
