Happy Reviews
Choosing 9 Creation Interior Design, under the leadership of Benny(our ID), was one of the best decisions we made for our renovation project.

As owners, we appreciated their collaborative approach, allowing us to be involved in every detail alongside their expertise

Renovation for first-time owners are undoubtedly stressful as it is a completely new experience and we have heard countless renovation nightmares from our friends and loved ones. However, we were extremely lucky to have met Li Chien as our ID and she was able to put our minds to ease throughout the entire renovation process

We are re-renovating our 25yrs old flats. Brandon Toon from 9Creation follow through the process and constantly updating us the renovation progress. He did a very thorough discussion on the wardrobe and kitchen cabinet when all the hacking work is done which gave us a better picture with drawing and detailed explanation. He managed to help us to speed up the process and handover to us within 2 months time with everything perfectly done!

Positive experience with 9 Creation Pte Ltd, who is the contractor for our recent
HDB
flat renovation.

Brandon, our project manger is responsive and extremely patient dealing with older folks (my parents). Thoughtful and always willing to adjust the work schedule to suit our family schedule and specific needs.
