Introduction
The following is intended to explain how Centercode uses this website, and any personal data we collect, to market and sell our products, and to explain the tools, services, and technologies we leverage to do so. Above all, our goal is to always be responsible in how we collect, store, and use your information, while complying with all relevant regulations.
To simplify this for our audience, we’ve split our policy into two parts. The first section is intended to provide a walk-through of the primary ways we handle your data. These are the things that we feel are most interesting to most of our audience. The second section provides you with the comprehensive details.
Regardless, we comply with and are passionate about this entire policy and would encourage you to take your time in reviewing it. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us at
privacy@centercode.com
.
Intended Audiences
The primary audience of this website is businesses interested in learning more about Centercode and its offerings. The secondary audiences are individuals seeking employment at Centercode, vendors, and others seeking to have a business relationship with us.
If you’re not with a business or looking for a job, but rather are an individual interested in testing new products, you should instead visit our
Betabound
portal (which has its own
Privacy Policy
). Betabound is always looking for enthusiastic testers.
Alternatively, if you’re a company actively using the Centercode Platform or our services, or are a user of such a company, please also see our
Customer Data Handling Privacy Policy
.
Personal Data Handling Overview
The following explains how your personal data is handled as you navigate and interact with Centercode and our website. When we talk about “personal data,” we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (or as otherwise defined under the privacy laws that apply).
Visitor Tracking
When you visit our website or interact with marketing and sales content and emails, your activity as you navigate is tracked via cookies or similar tracking technologies. Third party cookies also are served by our ad partners to allow for them to serve you targeted ads. Detailed information about the types of cookies you will encounter when visiting our website or interacting with our content is described below.
Gated Content
We offer significant industry and educational resources on our site. These include things like
white papers, ebooks, and recorded webinars
, and are typically “gated,” meaning we require information from you in order to download them. Our goal in investing significant resources in developing these valuable materials is to create an opportunity to learn about you and begin building a relationship. To achieve this goal, we use HubSpot to collect your full name and job title, email address, phone number, company name and size, and the intent of your download (e.g., researching vs. interested in purchasing). HubSpot then enriches this data with company information, reducing what we need to ask of you directly.
If we feel you’re an ideal prospect, a member of our internal account team will study your company and reach out to attempt to continue to build a relationship with you, in the hope that there will be an opportunity to work together. Our team is not pushy and is trained to be as consultative as possible. If you ask that they stop contacting you, they’ll politely and immediately respect your wishes.
By downloading our gated content, you’ll likely receive marketing email from us, such as future content and webinar announcements. We consider your attention limited and time valuable, and therefore deliberately limit our outreach. In addition, marketing email will include a very simple opt-out mechanism, which will remove you from future outreach.
Other Engagements
Beyond downloading content, here are some examples of a few other ways to engage with us that do collect personal or use information.
In-Site Chat
– You’ll notice a small circle in the bottom right of our site. This allows you to communicate with us in real-time via
HubSpot
. While you don’t need to provide any personal data to use our real-time chat (and we don’t send information to it), your email will be requested if we’re not actively available, so that we can get back to you.
Webinar Registration
– If you happen to participate in any of our webinars, the
Zoom
platform will collect basic contact information in order to access our live webinar event. Recorded webinars do not require interacting with Zoom.
Event Registration
– If you register to attend one of our live events (e.g. Conference, Roadshows), your contact information will be collected and stored on the events management platform.
Meeting Scheduling
– If you schedule a meeting with us, we use HubSpot and Zoom.
Other Online-Based Sales Interactions
– If you take part in any of our research surveys, your contact information and survey responses are collected and stored in our survey platform (e.g.,
SurveyMonkey
) and CRM (e.g., HubSpot). We use a workflow automation tool (e.g.,
Zapier
) to transfer sales lead data between our systems.
Email, Calendar, Drive, and Back-Office Systems
– Our back-office productivity platform is the business version of
Google Workspace
, including Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. If we interact with you directly, these email and calendar details will be stored by Google. We use other back-office systems to communicate among our team members (e.g.,
Slack
) and these systems can also hold contact information.
Job Applications
– If you apply for a job on our site, you’ll be asked to provide information relevant to the position via an applicant tracking system (e.g.,
Rippling
). We use platforms like these for all applicant communication and scheduling.
Billing Information
– If you order services from Centercode, you’ll be asked to provide contact and billing information (such as name, company name, email, credit card or bank account details, billing address, and shipping address). Billing information is used to pay for your Centercode Platform account. Billing information is stored by our secure third-party credit card and payment processor (
Stripe
) and/or our CRM provider (
HubSpot
).
Where relevant (related to sales and customer relationship management), these systems typically feed information to or from HubSpot (for marketing automation and CRM), our primary marketing and sales platform.
Our goal is to always centralize information as much as possible, but in every case,
we manage your personal data, know where it is, and how to delete it.
Finally, it’s important to understand that we only use your information for our own purposes.
We never sell the personal data you provide us, and when we share personal data you provide to us with our business service partners who are performing services for us, they do not have that right.
Detailed Policy
This policy describes how Centercode collects, uses, and discloses information, and the choices you have about the information we collect. When we refer to
Centercode
, we mean
Centercode, Inc.
, a California corporation.
Centercode owns and operates the
Centercode.com
website and runs its business of providing a cloud-based user testing platform, the
Centercode Platform
, and related
managed testing services
to businesses developing products.
Centercode also owns and operates the
Betabound.com
website and the web-based test participation portal known as Betabound (my.betabound.com), which we use to announce a wide variety of third-party user testing opportunities, and to register and collect information about individuals interested in participating in product tests. Our Betabound offerings are outside of the scope of this Centercode Privacy Policy (see
Scope
).
You should read this entire privacy policy. If you do not agree to its terms, you should not use our sites or services or submit personal data or other content to us. By using our sites or services and/or providing data to us you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this privacy policy.
Scope
This privacy policy describes our privacy practices related to personal data that we collect through or related to Centercode.com and our Centercode social media pages (collectively, the
Centercode Sites
), and information that we collect related to Centercode employment, vendor relationships, and business services.
This policy does not describe our practices for the information that we collect through or related to Betabound.com, the Betabound web-based test participation portal (my.betabound.com), Betabound social media pages, emails, and other communications related to Betabound (collectively, the
Betabound Sites
). If you’re a visitor to the Betabound Sites, an account holder on the Betabound portal, or otherwise encounter our platform inside of Betabound, please visit the
Betabound Privacy Policy
to learn about our privacy practices that apply to you.
Finally, some of the information we collect or process is collected by or on behalf of our customers in connection with the services we offer to our customers. This information and the use of the Centercode Platform is beyond the scope of this policy. For more information about data that we hold and process for our customers, please read about our
Customer Data Handling Privacy Policy
.
The Data We Collect and Receive
To operate and enable your use of the Centercode Sites, operate our business and services, contact you about Centercode, initiate and maintain your Centercode services, and for other legitimate business interests described in this policy, we receive and collect certain information from you and about you, which includes
Personal Data
.
When we use the term
Personal Data
, we mean information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (e.g., name, email address, phone number, location data, mailing address) (or as otherwise defined in the laws that apply).
By submitting or providing Personal Data or other information to us, you are representing that you have authority to do so and that we have full authorization to use this information in accordance with this privacy policy, even if the information relates to other individuals or entities.
Centercode Business Visitor and Contact Information
When you request more information or otherwise contact us through the Centercode Sites or otherwise (e.g. when you request a free trial or demo, register for a webinar, download content, complete a contact form, attend one of our events, interact through our social media pages, email, or call us), we may collect Personal Data such as your name, title, company name, job function, address, telephone number, email address, and other Personal Data and information that you voluntarily provide to us. If this occurs online, we may also collect the time, date, and location of the form you submitted.
Centercode Customer Contact and Billing Information
When customers establish services, we may collect, process, and use customer contact and billing information, including Personal Data, such as name, email, company name, billing and shipping address, credit card information, and bank account information, and other Personal Data and information that the customer voluntarily provides to us, such as when a customer contact completes a form or calls or submits an email to our sales, customer support, or services teams, or orders services from us. We process this data through our trusted third-party service providers, including billing and credit card processing providers (e.g., Stripe) and our CRM provider (HubSpot).
Centercode Job Applicant Information
When you inquire about employment with Centercode, we collect Personal Data from you such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, a resume including employment information and education information, a cover letter, your profile information, a statement of interest regarding your desired position, and similar Personal Data. We also collect the time, date, and location of the information you submitted.
When you apply for a job on our site, the information you provide goes to our applicant tracking system (e.g.,
Rippling
). We use our applicant tracking system(s) for all applicant communication and scheduling. As with the other third-party services we use, our provider holds your data on our behalf to provide services to us.
Other Information
We may collect information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, and from other third parties (such as
HubSpot
) in order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and content to you and to identify prospective customers. The information we collect this way is from publicly accessible sources, such as business details and business contact information (e.g., your name, business email, address, and phone number, and job title), and social media handles. We may also collect, track, and analyze non-identifying, statistical, or aggregated information from visitors and users of the Centercode Sites. Also, we passively collect data, as disclosed below in
Cookies, IP Addresses, and Other Passive Information Collection
.
How We Use and Share Personal Data

Centercode Visitor, Business, and Other Contact Information

We may also send you community newsletters and updates. If at any time you no longer wish to receive these communications, you can follow the instructions under
Updating Email Preferences

Aggregated or De-Identified Information

How We Share Data with Our Third-Party Service Providers and Partners

These third parties may have access to your data (including Personal Data) for the purpose of providing services to us and in compliance with our documented instructions.

Data Modification, Deletion, and Other Rights of European Residents
Individuals located in certain countries, including those residing in the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (“

If we are unable to do so, and you have not received a response from us, please contact us directly regarding your request. We will respond to your request promptly, and in no more than 30 days from your request, subject to applicable law. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, such as retaining copies of agreements you have entered into with us and/or for audit and investigation purposes, or in the event of a court order or requirement of law.
Deleted or updated Personal Data stored in our backup systems will be automatically deleted or updated within a reasonable period of time during our backup procedures, except as otherwise required by applicable law.
California and Similar State Privacy Rights
This section describes the rights of individuals who are California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CCPA”), and residents of other states or regions in the United States with similar applicable privacy laws with respect to their Personal Data. Please note that even where applicable, these rights are not absolute, and there may be cases when we decline the request of a covered individual as permitted by law.
Right of Access and Data Portability Rights: This is the right to request that we disclose what categories of Personal Data we have collected, used and disclosed about you such as:
the categories of sources for this Personal Data,
our legitimate business or commercial purpose for collecting or sharing this Personal Data,
the categories of third parties with which we share this Personal Data,
the specific pieces of the consumer’s Personal Data we collected about the consumer (a data portability request), and
if we sold or disclosed the consumer’s Personal Data for a legitimate business purpose, (i) a list disclosing the sale(s) that identifies the Personal Data that each category of recipient purchased, and (ii) disclosures made for a legitimate business purpose, identifying the Personal Data categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Right of Deletion: This is the right to request that we delete Personal Data collected or maintained by us, subject to certain exceptions.
Right to Non-Discrimination: This is the right to not receive any discriminatory treatment when you exercise one of your privacy rights under the CCPA or similar state laws.

Introduction
Given the nature of Betabound, we collect and manage a significant amount of personal data about our community members. As such, data privacy is always top of mind with regards to how we design both our platform and our service offerings. Our continuous goal is to handle all data as respectfully and responsibly as possible, while being completely transparent as to what exactly that means. When we talk about “personal data,” we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (or as otherwise defined under the privacy laws that apply).
We also understand that privacy is a complex subject, and focusing strictly on the legal details doesn’t necessarily highlight the items that are most important to many in our audience. Given that context, we’ve deliberately split our policy into two parts. The first section is intended to provide a plain-English overview of the topics that we feel are most interesting to most of our users. The next section provides you with the comprehensive details.
Regardless, we comply with and are passionate about this entire policy and would encourage you to take your time in reviewing this entire policy. Also, please don’t ever hesitate to reach out to us at
privacy@betabound.com
if you have any feedback or questions. If you don’t agree with any aspect of this policy, you should not use our services or sites.
Key Terms
Betabound
is an online portal that allows individuals to apply for and test new products and services. Betabound is owned and managed by Centercode, which works with a wide variety of companies to help them execute these tests. By joining Betabound, you’re expressing an interest in participating in these types of opportunities. In addition to managing Betabound, Centercode designs and develops the software platform which Betabound is built on, the
Centercode Platform
, which is also used by many other companies.
Your
Betabound Profile
is comprised of data that you directly provide to Betabound. This includes Personal Profile data, such as account (e.g., name, email) and demographic information (e.g., gender, age), and test platform data, which describes things you own or have access to (e.g., your phone, house, or computer) that may interact with the products you’re testing. This information is used to offer ideal testing opportunities based on your interests, and to contextualize the feedback you provide in any tests we manage that you choose to participate in. For example, if our customer is looking to learn which features are in most demand by people in a certain age range, information about your age or date of birth allows us to find ideal testers for them for this purpose. We don’t sell this information, and we only grant access to this information to those companies whose tests you’ve explicitly applied to within Betabound or where you have otherwise directed us to disclose this information to our customer.
Test Feedback
includes everything you provide when applying for and participating in a specific test within Betabound. This typically takes the form of things like bug reports, feature suggestions, file uploads, and survey responses. This is the information these companies need to improve their products. By providing this information, it’s important that you understand that our customer will own this data from that point on. As such, you should only create a Betabound account and apply for tests if you’re comfortable with providing both your Betabound Profile information and your specific Test Feedback to the companies that make the products you’re interested in testing.
Key Concepts
Betabound Profile information provided to Betabound is used to identify appropriate candidates for product tests. From time to time, we may also use it for aggregate research purposes. We don’t sell this information, and we don’t share this information for purposes other than these tests. Beyond your basic member profile, you can choose how much information you provide, understanding that providing more information increases the opportunities available to you, as we can better target you for those opportunities.
If you receive an announcement for a Betabound testing opportunity that you find interesting, and you choose to pursue that opportunity (which requires logging in to Betabound and completing an application where you indicate your willingness to share your personal data), your personal data may then be shared with the company developing that product (i.e. our customer). This is to ensure that you’re an ideal candidate for that test.
If you’re selected for a Betabound test, and actively choose to join it (which typically involves completing both participation and non-disclosure agreements), your Betabound Profile will continue to be available to that company, as well as any feedback or files that you provide throughout the test. Again, please understand that this company owns this information and feedback, as you have actively become a tester for their product.
While participating in a Betabound test, other testers will have access to some personal data about you, as we see fit, based on the needs of that test. This will typically include your full real name and much of your feedback. Note that our tests are typically run in a very collaborative nature, and therefore anonymity shouldn’t be expected. In other words, if you’re not comfortable with other testers knowing who you are, you shouldn’t participate in Betabound or our tests.
In addition to tests we manage on Betabound, we also announce testing opportunities for many other companies. These tests don’t occur on Betabound, and therefore
betabound.com
will not appear in the URL. Some of these companies are our customers using our platform (so the experience may be similar), while others are not. In either case, you should always read the privacy policy of each individual company before creating an account and/or providing any information to them.
If at any point you’d like to remove your account from Betabound, you’re absolutely free to do so, with the exception of when you’re an active tester of a physical product. In these scenarios, we typically need to retrieve the product prior to you leaving the community and erasing your personal data. Upon leaving, your personal data will be wiped completely, but you will still have access to any agreements you’ve already completed.

Scope
This privacy policy describes our privacy practices concerning the information that we collect through or related to Betabound.com, the Betabound web-based portal (my.betabound.com), Betabound social media pages, emails, and other communications with you related to Betabound (collectively, the
Betabound Sites
).
This policy does not describe our privacy practices related to Centercode.com, and our Centercode social media pages (collectively, the
Centercode Sites
), and information we gather related to Centercode employment, vendor relationships, and business services. If you’re a visitor to the Centercode Sites or a vendor, business contact, or job applicant, please visit the
Centercode Privacy Policy
to learn about the privacy practices that apply to you.
Finally, we offer our platform to subscribing customers that use their own instance of the Centercode Platform to develop and manage their own test communities and test programs. Their use of our platform and the use by their authorized users is outside the scope of this privacy policy. If you encounter our platform outside of Betabound, you should review the privacy policy of the company using our platform before creating an account. To learn more about the data that we hold and process for our customers on their behalf, please review our
Customer Data Handling Privacy Policy
.
The Data We Collect and Receive
To operate and enable your use of the Betabound Sites, provide testing services to our customers, operate our business, contact you about Betabound, and for other legitimate business interests described in this policy, we receive and collect certain information from you and about you, including Betabound Profile information, Test Feedback, and other information, which includes
Personal Data
.
Except as described below for California consumers, when we use the term
Personal Data
, we mean information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (e.g., name, email address, phone number, location data, mailing address)
(or as otherwise defined in the laws that apply)
.
By submitting or providing Personal Data or other information to us, you are representing that you have authority to do so and that we have full authorization to use this information in accordance with this privacy policy, even if the information relates to other individuals or entities. You agree to provide and maintain complete and accurate information, and understand that you are solely responsible for the data that you provide to us.
Betabound Community Member Information
In order to create a Betabound Community Member account, we require you to provide both basic account information (such as your first and last name, email address, username and password, time zone, country, and date of birth), as well as Betabound Basic Profile information (such as preferred operating system and mobile platform, information about products you are interested in testing, and, optionally, gender). You have the option of completing an Extended Profile, where you provide additional information (including Personal Data, such as complete residential address, phone number, languages spoken, social media handles, home ownership and family information, details about your education, employment information, information about experience with technology and with testing, and similar information).
At different times, we may also ask you to complete voluntary surveys seeking more information, including Personal Data, about your interest in and qualifications for tests that may be conducted by us on behalf of our customers. While you do not need to provide Extended Profile and additional information, providing additional information can increase the number of test opportunities available to you because we can match your information with the test participant requirements for specific tests.
In addition, sometimes additional information is required for you to be eligible to participate in certain tests. For example, you are required to complete an Extended Profile, including phone number and address, if you wish to participate in any test that involves sending a physical product to you.
We own and control the information that you provide as a part of your Betabound registration, profile, and completion of other Betabound community-level member questionnaires or surveys and share this information as described below in How We Use and Share Personal Data. We call this information your Betabound Profile.
However, your Test Feedback (any information that we collect or you provide during or in connection with applying for, and/or participating in a specific test) is collected by us on behalf of the company that has hired us to manage its test, and we process this information on behalf of that customer in accordance with our separate agreement with our customer.
Where we process your information on behalf of our customer, or where you share your personal data or agree that we may share your personal data with our customer, the data collection and privacy practices of our customer (such as those disclosed in its privacy policy and any other agreement(s) you are asked to enter into with our customer) control as between you and our customer. For more information about the information that we hold and process for our customers on their behalf, please read about our
Customer Data Handling Privacy Policy
.
If you have any questions about the privacy practices of any Centercode customer, please contact our customer about your inquiry.
Becoming a Betabound Community Member is entirely voluntary. If you do not wish to provide the required information, you should not become a Betabound Community Member. If you do not wish to provide any optional additional requested information, you should not do so.
Referrals and Ambassador Program Information
Through our Betabound Ambassador program and our participant Referral program, we ask our members to voluntarily provide email addresses of friends and others who they’d like to refer to us as potential testers and Betabound members. Do not provide us with email addresses unless you have the authority to do so.
Test Announcement Information
If you provide information to us so that we can announce your third-party user test, we may collect, process, and use the Personal Data and other information that you provide to us, such as your contact information, company information, and product information. You represent that you have authority to provide us with the information that you supply and authorize us to post the information you provide to us on the Betabound Sites. You are solely responsible for the contents of the data that you provide to us.
Other Information Collected
As you interact with us regarding your Betabound account or your interest in our offerings, such as through Betabound.com, Betabound social media pages, emails, and other communications outside of your Betabound account, we may gather Personal Data from you, such as your name, phone number, and email address, and any other information you voluntarily provide to us. Also, we passively collect data as disclosed below in Cookies, IP Addresses, and Other Passive Information collection.
How We Use and Share Personal Data
This section describes how we use and share information within the scope of this policy.
Betabound Community Member Information
When you provide your email to us during the Betabound registration process, you are agreeing to allow us to use the information that you provide, including Personal Data, to determine if you may match the profile for participation in tests conducted by or on behalf of our customers. When we believe you might be interested in our customers’ tests, we will contact you about these opportunities using the contact information you have provided to us in your Betabound Profile.
We may also send you newsletters, announcements, or communications, including by email and text message, that we believe may be of interest to you. If at any time you no longer wish to receive announcements about these test opportunities or other communications, or wish to modify your account preferences, you can follow the instructions under
Updating Email Preferences
and/or
Removing Your Betabound Account
below to either modify your preferences or terminate your Betabound Community Member account.
Unless and until you express interest in participating in, accept an invitation to participate in, or actually participate in a test being conducted by Centercode on behalf of a Centercode customer and in doing so indicate your willingness to share your Personal Data, we will not share your Personal Data in any way that identifies you to any Centercode customer.
However, once you indicate your willingness to share your personal data in connection with a test being conducted by Centercode on behalf of its customer, you are agreeing to allow us to share the information you have provided to us through your Betabound registration, including your profile information and any other Betabound qualification survey, community survey, questionnaire, form, email or other communication about your profile, with the Centercode customer for which we are conducting a test.
We provide this data to enable our customers to identify ideal test candidates and, if you are selected as a test participant, for our customers to include this data as a part of their test data.
Once shared with our customer, the customer determines its own policies and practices for the use, sharing, and disclosure of this information, and Centercode does not control how it chooses to use, share, or disclose this information. Before you apply to participate in any test, you should read the company’s privacy policy or other privacy disclosure carefully so that you understand how your information, including your Personal Data, will be used and shared by this third party
.
In addition to this profile information being shared with our customers as described above, sometimes during a test, a subset may be shared with other test participants where the test includes collaborative activities, such as group chats and discussions. During these activities, selected profile information, which can include your full name, username, and any text or file-based feedback you provide in that group activity, may be visible to other participating testers. If you are not comfortable with this, do not participate in the group activity or share text or files in the group activity.
Referrals and Ambassador Program Information
We use email addresses we received through our Referral or Ambassador Program to contact these potential new test participants to see if they are interested in joining Betabound. If you receive an email from us and wish to be removed from our interest list, please contact us at optout@betabound.com and identify that you received a referral email and wish for us to delete your email address.
Test Announcement Information
When you provide information to us to announce your third-party user test, we use this information to publicly announce the test on Betabound.com.
Please do not provide any Personal Data, confidential data, or other information that you do not want to reveal to the public at large.
Betabound Visitor, Business, and Other Contact Information
We use contact information that you have provided as a visitor to the Betabound Sites or through your business or other contacts to contact you to discuss your interest in Betabound and Centercode services, and to send you information such as announcements of opportunities and events regarding Betabound and product and service tests. Where you provide us with your contact information, we may also send you community newsletters and updates. If at any time you no longer wish to receive these communications, you can follow the instructions under
Updating Email Preferences

regarding the general level of participation of Betabound Community Members in tests that we conduct, for our customers to assist in determining whether they are a good candidate for other tests we might perform for customers;

in connection with company transactions such as asset sales, reorganizations, mergers, joint ventures, assignments, financings, dispositions of stock, and other changes of control, where Personal Data and other information is transferred to third parties for legitimate purposes in connection with the transactions;
as we believe to be necessary or appropriate under applicable law, including laws outside of your country of residence, to comply with legal process, to respond to the requests of courts or governmental authorities, to enforce our terms and conditions, to protect our operations, rights, privacy, safety, customers, or property (or that of others), and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit damages we may sustain; and
for other purposes you have specifically agreed to.
Aggregated or De-Identified Information
Where data is aggregated or de-identified so that it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, we may use and disclose it for any business purpose, except as otherwise prohibited under applicable law. Typically, this would be used for research purposes, or to promote our community, but we may have other business uses.

How to Exercise Your California and Similar State Law Privacy Rights
If you would like to access this policy in an alternative format or wish to exercise your privacy rights
under California or similar US state laws
, please contact us at privacy@betabound.com or (800) 705-6540 or reach us by using the methods provided in Questions or Concerns below.
Please be aware that when you make a request, we’ll take steps to verify that you are authorized to make the request.
You must provide sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to your request. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. Making a request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Data provided in the request to verify your identity and authority to make the request.
Links to Third-Party Sites
The Betabound Sites and emails that come from us contain links to other websites on the Internet. For example, on Betabound, we collect and organize a wide variety of test opportunities from all over the world, so we often announce opportunities for third parties, including those that are our customers and those that are not our customers.
We announce these opportunities through Betabound and also in other communications to you, such as in emails. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of all such third parties and any agreement(s) that you are asked to enter into in connection with any test or participant community membership.
Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies and collection, use, and disclosure practices (including the data security practices) of these third parties, including third parties that are our customers.
Data of Children
The Betabound Sites are not intended for use by minors under the age of 16. We do not knowingly or specifically collect information from these minors through the Betabound Sites or otherwise. If you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from minors or have any questions or concerns regarding the use of our services to collect information from minors, please contact us at
privacy@betabound.com
so that we may investigate and delete the information from our servers as necessary.
International Transfer of Data
The Personal Data and other information we collect from you is used, stored, and/or processed by us in the United States, where we are located. In addition, in the circumstances described in this privacy policy where your Personal Data and other information is transferred to a third party (including our customer), this data may also be used, stored, and/or processed outside of the United States in any country in which the third party has facilities or engages service providers. These countries may not offer the same legal protections offered in your country and may be considered by your country to offer insufficient legal protections.
European Residents have a right to withdraw their consent to cross-border transfers of their data, and if you wish to do so with respect to your Personal Data that we control, you may contact us at
privacy@betabound.com
. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of actions based on your consent prior to your withdrawal.
If your request relates to information that we hold on our customer’s behalf (e.g., Test Feedback), you must contact our customer, the data controller, for assistance.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy. If we make changes to this policy, you will find the revised privacy policy posted on the Betabound Sites, along with the effective date of the revised privacy policy. Your use of and access to the Betabound Sites and the Centercode Platform after any changes become effective will be considered your acceptance of those changes and will constitute your agreement to be bound by the new or modified privacy policy.

Effective Date: March 4, 2024
Introduction
This policy explains our privacy practices for the personal data that we process and hold as a result of our customers’ use of our cloud-based software platform, the
Centercode Platform
, to manage their testing programs for their products and services. When we refer to Centercode, “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to Centercode, Inc., a California corporation. When we talk about “personal data,” we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (or as otherwise defined in the laws that apply).
Because our customers’ user testing programs involve their collection of personal data, we hold and process this personal data on behalf of these customers. Above all, our goal is to help our customers run exceptional user testing programs and to fully comply with applicable privacy laws.
To simplify this policy for our audience, we’ve split it into two parts. The first section is intended to highlight key terms and provide a highlight of our privacy practices for the personal data of our customers’ end users. The second section provides you with the comprehensive details.
We comply with, and are passionate about, this entire policy, and would encourage you to take your time in reviewing it. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.
If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, you should not use the Centercode Platform or submit personal data or other content to the Centercode Platform. By using the Centercode Platform and/or providing data to it, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this policy.
Intended Audiences
The audience of this document is the end users of our customers’ Centercode Platform sites. If you are interacting with our Centercode.com business website, are interacting with Centercode as a prospective customer, or are interacting with us as a prospective job applicant, you should instead visit our
Centercode Privacy Policy
.
If you’re interacting with our Betabound.com website, are a registered member of Centercode’s
Betabound.com
community of interested test participants, or are interested in becoming a member, and wish to understand our privacy practices for your personal data on that site, you should instead visit our
Betabound Privacy Policy
.
Key Terms
A
Centercode Customer
is a Centercode customer that uses our
services
.
A Centercode Platform
Implementation
is a Centercode Customer’s unique instance of the Centercode Platform accessible via a unique web address. A wide variety of companies use the Centercode Platform to execute tests of new products and services and to build communities of individuals interested in participating in these tests.
Customer Data
is the information our customers collect using their Centercode Platform Implementations. We call this information Customer Data because our Centercode Customer owns and controls this data. Customer Data includes personal data, such as account information (e.g., name, email) and demographic information (e.g., gender, age) that you provide when you create and update your account and profile. It also includes other data, such as information about the kinds of devices you use, agreements you enter into with our customer through the Implementation, and the feedback you provide when you participate in a particular test or community activity, such as bug reports, feature suggestions, file uploads, and survey responses.
An
Authorized User
is an end user of the Centercode Platform who has been authorized or permitted by a Centercode Customer to access its Centercode Platform Implementation.
Key Concepts
The Centercode Customer decides what personal and other information it asks for and collects from or about you using its Implementation, from account and profile creation, to community questionnaires and user tests.
The Centercode Customer controls how it configures its Implementation within the parameters available in the Centercode Platform.
The Centercode Customer decides what third-party systems it integrates with and into its Implementation and/or what additional cookies or tracking technologies it incorporates into its Implementation and communications sent from its Implementation. These third-party systems and technologies typically involve the sharing of data with other systems or providers.
The Centercode Customer decides how it uses and shares the Customer Data it collects, including your personal data in its Implementation, and decides its retention policies and practices for this Customer Data. You should review the privacy notice or policy of the Centercode Customer.
We hold and process Customer Data provided by an Authorized User (including personal data) on behalf of our Centercode Customer and in accordance with our agreement with, and instructions from, the Centercode Customer.
In addition to processing Customer Data, the Centercode Platform passively collects other information, including IP address. We collect this information using cookies and through system logging, and this provides information about your visitation to Centercode Platform Implementations. We use this information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our services and business, including support, security, as required by law or to comply with legal process, for compliance investigations, and for audits, and use it in anonymous or aggregated form to develop and enhance our products and services, identify trends, and for other internal business purposes.
If you, as an Authorized User of a Centercode Customer, would like to remove your account from a Centercode Customer’s Implementation or have another request related to your personal data that is Customer Data, you should contact the Centercode Customer that operates the Implementation for any requests beyond support using the functionalities available within the Implementation to remove or update your account information. If you are unable to contact the Centercode Customer controlling the Implementation, you may contact us at
privacy@centercode.com
for assistance.
We never sell the personal data you provide us, and when we share personal data you provide to us with our business service partners who are performing services for us, they do not have that right.
Detailed Policy
This Centercode Customer Data Handling Practices policy is our privacy policy that describes how we collect, hold, use, disclose, and otherwise process the personal data of Authorized Users of our Centercode Customers in connection with our
services
. This policy does not describe the privacy practices of our Centercode Customers.
Scope
Centercode maintains separate privacy policies that describe its privacy practices with respect to personal data collected outside of Centercode Customers’ Implementations.
This policy does not describe our privacy practices related to Centercode.com, and our Centercode social media pages (collectively, the
Centercode Sites
), and information we gather related to Centercode employment, customer relationships, vendor relationships, and business services. If you’re a visitor to the Centercode Sites or a vendor, business contact, or job applicant, please visit the
Centercode Privacy Policy
to learn about the privacy practices that apply to you.
This policy also does not describe our privacy practices for the information that we collect through or related to Betabound.com, the Betabound web-based test participation portal (my.betabound.com), Betabound social media pages, emails, and other communications with you related to Betabound (collectively, the
Betabound Sites
). If you’re a visitor to the Betabound Sites, an account holder on the Betabound portal, or otherwise encounter our platform inside of Betabound, please visit the
Betabound Privacy Policy
to learn about our privacy practices that apply to you.
Centercode Customers have separate agreements with us that govern their services (“
Customer Contracts
”). The Customer Contract permits the Centercode Customer to create and configure its Centercode Platform Implementation so that its Authorized Users can join and access its Implementation. The Customer Contract contains our commitment to deliver the services to our Centercode Customer, which then can allow Authorized Users to access the Services. This policy is not intended to limit or modify any obligation between Centercode and any Centercode Customer under the Customer Contract.
The Customer Data We Process
While the Customer Contract governs exactly what information is Customer Data, in general, Customer Data is information collected by the Centercode Customer from its Authorized Users using its Centercode Platform Implementation. The Centercode Customer’s Authorized Users regularly submit information to the Centercode Customer’s Implementation. The Authorized User would create an account and profile on the Centercode Customer’s Implementation as a member of the Centercode Customer’s test participant community or as a participant on its test(s). This Authorized User might also submit information like bug reports, feature suggestions, file uploads, survey responses, agreements, and similar information when applying for or participating in a test conducted on the Centercode Platform or as a member of the Centercode Customer’s test participant community. The Centercode Customer owns and controls its Customer Data, including personal data that is part of the Customer Data.
What This Means for End Users
Because this Customer Data is owned and controlled by the Centercode Customer, the data collection and privacy practices of the Centercode Customer control as between the Centercode Customer and you. You should read the privacy policy or notice of the Centercode Customer to understand how your personal data will be collected, used and shared by the Centercode Customer. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies and personal data collection, use, and disclosure practices (including the data security practices) of third parties, including Centercode Customers.
The Centercode Customer ultimately determines who its Authorized Users are and what information it collects from its Authorized Users using Centercode’s services, even where the Centercode Customer hires Centercode staff to perform
Managed Testing Services
on its behalf. The Centercode Customer configures (or directs the configuration of) its Implementation of the Centercode Platform, including which third-party applications or technologies it might incorporate into its use of the Centercode Platform (via API, third party cookies, or otherwise) and the third-party applications to which it transfers Customer Data or from which it collects and imports Customer Data into the Centercode Platform.
The Centercode Platform provides different ways for the Centercode Customer to allow for collaboration and community spaces within its Centercode Platform Implementation. These features may display your full name, username, or other information that you provide to other Authorized Users.
The Centercode Customer is responsible for its configuration and use of its Implementation, and as the owner and controller of its Customer Data, is responsible for any required user consent or privacy disclosures.
How Centercode Uses and Shares Customer Data
We collect, hold, use, and share Customer Data as needed to provide the services to our Centercode Customer in accordance with the instructions of the Centercode Customer, including the terms in the Customer Contract and through its use of the functionalities of Centercode’s services, and as required by applicable law, legal process, or regulation. We also use it to respond to requests, comments, and questions by Authorized Users, to send emails and other communications to Authorized Users relating to service, technical, and administrative matters, such as security notices and updates about changes to our policies, and to investigate and help prevent security issues.
We do not sell your personal data.
Location of Centercode Customer Data; Third-Party Sub-Processors
The Customer Data is located or processed by Centercode as described in our third-party sub-processors list available
here
. We do not control how our Centercode Customer processes the Customer Data, including the country or countries to which any Centercode Customer transfers the Customer Data. The United States and such other countries may not offer the same legal protections offered in your country of residence and may be considered by your country to offer insufficient legal protections.
Security of Centercode Customer Data
We maintain a written security policy for the security, integrity, and protection of the Customer Data against unauthorized disclosure or loss. We have physical, technical, and organizational processes and measures in place designed to safeguard this data. When accessing the Centercode Platform via a supported web browser, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to protect information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure the data is safe and secure in transit. Data stored on the Centercode Platform is encrypted at rest using AES-256.
We host the Centercode Platform on cloud-based servers located in a secure data center environment using a firewall and other advanced technology designed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. The Centercode Platform requires verified email addresses, unique usernames, and strong passwords for account authentication.
Other Information – Cookies and Log Data on the Centercode Platform
In addition to Customer Data, we collect the following cookies and log data (“
Other Information
”) automatically when you access and use the services. When you access your account on the Centercode Platform, the platform uses mandatory session cookies to grant you access to, and secure, your account. These cookies allow the Centercode Platform to uniquely identify you following the entry of your username and password so that you can access your account. Session cookies are required in order to use the Centercode Platform.
In addition, when you log into an account, our servers automatically log typical HTTP information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, a unique device identifier (a UUID), your device name, operating system type and version, network type, country of origin, account use information (e.g. the pages viewed, the links clicked, the dates and times of requests and referral URL, and other actions taken), error messages received, problems encountered, and similar data.
If you are an end user with access to the Centercode Support role, you have access to additional features including our in-platform chat feature and in-platform guidance and support. In connection with these support features, we have cookies that track you within the platform. These cookies provide analytics information for our internal use and do not track these supported users outside of the platform.
Finally, we use Google Analytics cookies with anonymization to analyze how our end users interact with the Centercode Platform (Starter Edition, Beta Edition, and Delta Editions only). The information generated about your usage is transmitted to Google as anonymized and is used to compile statistical reports on activity on the Centercode Platform to help us improve the Centercode Platform and your experience. The information we receive from Google Analytics is likewise anonymized data and we cannot use it to individually identify any particular visitor or user. We encourage you to read the
Google Privacy Policy
. You can opt out of these cookies
here
.
We use Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our services and business. More specifically, we may use it to provide services and customer support, including for user authentication, user support, service security and performance, fraud monitoring and prevention, and security audits. We also use Other Information as required by applicable law, legal process, or regulation. Where requested by the Centercode Customer, we may share log data with Centercode Customers for audit, compliance, investigations, and customer support purposes. We also use Other Information, such as de-identified and aggregated log data gathered about the general use of our services, for internal business purposes, such as developing and enhancing our products and services, identifying usage trends, and for other legitimate business purposes.
A Centercode Customer can configure its Centercode Platform Implementation and emails that come from its Implementation to add additional cookies or institute other methods of passive information collection or tracking technologies, such as web beacons, clear gifs, and similar technologies. The Centercode Customer is responsible for its use of these technologies and is responsible for any required privacy disclosures.
The Centercode Platform currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” browser signals.
Retention of Centercode Customer Data and Other Information
We will retain Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of our Centercode Customer, including in the Customer Contract, and as required by applicable law. Deleted or updated Customer Data stored in our backup systems will be automatically deleted or updated within a reasonable period during Centercode’s backup procedures, except as otherwise required by applicable law.
We may retain Other Information for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy. This can include keeping Other Information after a Centercode Customer has deactivated its account and/or after you have removed your account for the period needed for us to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
Centercode Platform Use Requirements
Authorized Users are required to comply with the
Centercode Platform Terms of Use for End Users
. We require Centercode Customers to comply with all applicable laws governing the collection, use, and sharing of personal data, including law governing the collection of personal data from minors. Please contact us immediately at
privacy@centercode.com
if you learn that any Centercode Platform Implementation holds the information of minors in violation of applicable law.
Links to Third-Party Sites
The Centercode Customer’s Implementation and emails that come from the Implementation may contain links to our Centercode Customer’s other websites and websites of other third parties on the Internet. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of such third parties.
Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies and personal data collection, use, and disclosure practices (including the data security practices) of these third parties, including Centercode Customers.
Link to Betabound.com
Certain editions of the Centercode Platform (the Starter, Beta, and Delta editions) may contain a link to Centercode’s
Betabound.com
community of interested test participants. Please note that if you visit Betabound.com, the
Betabound Privacy Policy
will apply.
Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to change this policy. If we make changes to it, you will find the revised policy posted
here
, along with the effective date of the revised policy. Your use of and access to the Centercode Platform after any changes become effective will be considered your acceptance of those changes and will constitute your agreement to be bound by the new or modified policy.
European Personal Data and International Data Transfers
We offer Centercode Customers a
Data Processing Addendum
that includes provisions to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “
GDPR
”), including as adopted by the United Kingdom, and standard contractual data protection clauses for the cross-border transfer of personal data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to the United States. The Centercode Customer determines its Authorized Users and therefore it is the Centercode Customer’s obligation to ensure that it has entered into the Data Processing Addendum (or an appropriate data processing addendum including valid standard contractual data protection clauses) with Centercode. Centercode Customers whose data collection practices are subject to the GDPR can find more information on our
GDPR and Centercode
page.
“Controller” and “Processor”
In certain jurisdictions, data protection law (including the GDPR) differentiates between the “data controller” and the “data processor” of personal data. Each Centercode Customer, as the owner of its Customer Data, is the “data controller” with respect to its Customer Data. The Centercode Customer determines its own data privacy policies and practices for its Implementation of the Centercode Platform and for the Customer Data. We are the “data processor” with respect to the Centercode Customer Data and the “data controller” with respect to Other Information.
Personal Data Requests
Individuals residing in certain localities, including the European Union, the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (“
European Residents
”) and consumers in certain US states may have certain statutory rights regarding their personal data. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, individuals with these rights may have rights including the right to request access to, or information about, their personal data, or seek to update, delete, or correct their personal data. You can use the features available within the Centercode Platform to perform many of these tasks. Where you are unable to do so, you must contact the Centercode Customer for any assistance that you require with your information that is Customer Data.
You may contact us at
privacy@centercode.com
regarding any request relating to Other Information that is personal data and may contact us if you require assistance getting in touch with our Centercode Customer. When you make a request to us, for your protection we may need to verify your identity prior to implementing any request. We will respond to your request promptly, and in no more than 30 days from your request, subject to applicable law.
Any European Resident who is dissatisfied with the handling of a request regarding his or her personal data within the scope of the GDPR has a right to lodge a complaint with his or her local data protection authority responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR.
Questions or Concerns
Questions about this policy or our information practices should be directed to us by email at

Introduction
This policy explains our privacy practices for the personal data that we process and hold as a result of our customers’ use of our cloud-based software platform, the
Centercode Platform
, to manage their testing programs for their products and services. When we refer to Centercode, “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to Centercode, Inc., a California corporation. When we talk about “personal data,” we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (or as otherwise defined in the laws that apply).
Because our customers’ user testing programs involve their collection of personal data, we hold and process this personal data on behalf of these customers. Above all, our goal is to help our customers run exceptional user testing programs and to fully comply with applicable privacy laws.
To simplify this policy for our audience, we’ve split it into two parts. The first section is intended to highlight key terms and provide a highlight of our privacy practices for the personal data of our customers’ end users. The second section provides you with the comprehensive details.
We comply with, and are passionate about, this entire policy, and would encourage you to take your time in reviewing it. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.
If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, you should not use the Centercode Platform or submit personal data or other content to the Centercode Platform. By using the Centercode Platform and/or providing data to it, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this policy.
Intended Audiences
The audience of this document is the end users of our customers’ Centercode Platform sites. If you are interacting with our Centercode.com business website, are interacting with Centercode as a prospective customer, or are interacting with us as a prospective job applicant, you should instead visit our
Centercode Privacy Policy
.
If you’re interacting with our Betabound.com website, are a registered member of Centercode’s
Betabound.com
community of interested test participants, or are interested in becoming a member, and wish to understand our privacy practices for your personal data on that site, you should instead visit our
Betabound Privacy Policy
.
Key Terms
A
Centercode Customer
is a Centercode customer that uses our
services
.
A Centercode Platform
Implementation
is a Centercode Customer’s unique instance of the Centercode Platform accessible via a unique web address. A wide variety of companies use the Centercode Platform to execute tests of new products and services and to build communities of individuals interested in participating in these tests.
Customer Data
is the information our customers collect using their Centercode Platform Implementations. We call this information Customer Data because our Centercode Customer owns and controls this data. Customer Data includes personal data, such as account information (e.g., name, email) and demographic information (e.g., gender, age) that you provide when you create and update your account and profile. It also includes other data, such as information about the kinds of devices you use, agreements you enter into with our customer through the Implementation, and the feedback you provide when you participate in a particular test or community activity, such as bug reports, feature suggestions, file uploads, and survey responses.
An
Authorized User
is an end user of the Centercode Platform who has been authorized or permitted by a Centercode Customer to access its Centercode Platform Implementation.
Key Concepts
The Centercode Customer decides what personal and other information it asks for and collects from or about you using its Implementation, from account and profile creation, to community questionnaires and user tests.
The Centercode Customer controls how it configures its Implementation within the parameters available in the Centercode Platform.
The Centercode Customer decides what third-party systems it integrates with and into its Implementation and/or what additional cookies or tracking technologies it incorporates into its Implementation and communications sent from its Implementation. These third-party systems and technologies typically involve the sharing of data with other systems or providers.
The Centercode Customer decides how it uses and shares the Customer Data it collects, including your personal data in its Implementation, and decides its retention policies and practices for this Customer Data. You should review the privacy notice or policy of the Centercode Customer.
We hold and process Customer Data provided by an Authorized User (including personal data) on behalf of our Centercode Customer and in accordance with our agreement with, and instructions from, the Centercode Customer.
In addition to processing Customer Data, the Centercode Platform passively collects other information, including IP address. We collect this information using cookies and through system logging, and this provides information about your visitation to Centercode Platform Implementations. We use this information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our services and business, including support, security, as required by law or to comply with legal process, for compliance investigations, and for audits, and use it in anonymous or aggregated form to develop and enhance our products and services, identify trends, and for other internal business purposes.
If you, as an Authorized User of a Centercode Customer, would like to remove your account from a Centercode Customer’s Implementation or have another request related to your personal data that is Customer Data, you should contact the Centercode Customer that operates the Implementation for any requests beyond support using the functionalities available within the Implementation to remove or update your account information. If you are unable to contact the Centercode Customer controlling the Implementation, you may contact us at
privacy@centercode.com
for assistance.
We never sell the personal data you provide us, and when we share personal data you provide to us with our business service partners who are performing services for us, they do not have that right.
Detailed Policy
This Centercode Customer Data Handling Practices policy is our privacy policy that describes how we collect, hold, use, disclose, and otherwise process the personal data of Authorized Users of our Centercode Customers in connection with our
services
. This policy does not describe the privacy practices of our Centercode Customers.
Scope
Centercode maintains separate privacy policies that describe its privacy practices with respect to personal data collected outside of Centercode Customers’ Implementations.
This policy does not describe our privacy practices related to Centercode.com, and our Centercode social media pages (collectively, the
Centercode Sites
), and information we gather related to Centercode employment, customer relationships, vendor relationships, and business services. If you’re a visitor to the Centercode Sites or a vendor, business contact, or job applicant, please visit the
Centercode Privacy Policy
to learn about the privacy practices that apply to you.
This policy also does not describe our privacy practices for the information that we collect through or related to Betabound.com, the Betabound web-based test participation portal (my.betabound.com), Betabound social media pages, emails, and other communications with you related to Betabound (collectively, the
Betabound Sites
). If you’re a visitor to the Betabound Sites, an account holder on the Betabound portal, or otherwise encounter our platform inside of Betabound, please visit the
Betabound Privacy Policy
to learn about our privacy practices that apply to you.
Centercode Customers have separate agreements with us that govern their services (“
Customer Contracts
”). The Customer Contract permits the Centercode Customer to create and configure its Centercode Platform Implementation so that its Authorized Users can join and access its Implementation. The Customer Contract contains our commitment to deliver the services to our Centercode Customer, which then can allow Authorized Users to access the Services. This policy is not intended to limit or modify any obligation between Centercode and any Centercode Customer under the Customer Contract.
The Customer Data We Process
While the Customer Contract governs exactly what information is Customer Data, in general, Customer Data is information collected by the Centercode Customer from its Authorized Users using its Centercode Platform Implementation. The Centercode Customer’s Authorized Users regularly submit information to the Centercode Customer’s Implementation. The Authorized User would create an account and profile on the Centercode Customer’s Implementation as a member of the Centercode Customer’s test participant community or as a participant on its test(s). This Authorized User might also submit information like bug reports, feature suggestions, file uploads, survey responses, agreements, and similar information when applying for or participating in a test conducted on the Centercode Platform or as a member of the Centercode Customer’s test participant community. The Centercode Customer owns and controls its Customer Data, including personal data that is part of the Customer Data.
What This Means for End Users
Because this Customer Data is owned and controlled by the Centercode Customer, the data collection and privacy practices of the Centercode Customer control as between the Centercode Customer and you. You should read the privacy policy or notice of the Centercode Customer to understand how your personal data will be collected, used and shared by the Centercode Customer. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies and personal data collection, use, and disclosure practices (including the data security practices) of third parties, including Centercode Customers.
The Centercode Customer ultimately determines who its Authorized Users are and what information it collects from its Authorized Users using Centercode’s services, even where the Centercode Customer hires Centercode staff to perform
Managed Testing Services
on its behalf. The Centercode Customer configures (or directs the configuration of) its Implementation of the Centercode Platform, including which third-party applications or technologies it might incorporate into its use of the Centercode Platform (via API, third party cookies, or otherwise) and the third-party applications to which it transfers Customer Data or from which it collects and imports Customer Data into the Centercode Platform.
The Centercode Platform provides different ways for the Centercode Customer to allow for collaboration and community spaces within its Centercode Platform Implementation. These features may display your full name, username, or other information that you provide to other Authorized Users.
The Centercode Customer is responsible for its configuration and use of its Implementation, and as the owner and controller of its Customer Data, is responsible for any required user consent or privacy disclosures.
How Centercode Uses and Shares Customer Data
We collect, hold, use, and share Customer Data as needed to provide the services to our Centercode Customer in accordance with the instructions of the Centercode Customer, including the terms in the Customer Contract and through its use of the functionalities of Centercode’s services, and as required by applicable law, legal process, or regulation. We also use it to respond to requests, comments, and questions by Authorized Users, to send emails and other communications to Authorized Users relating to service, technical, and administrative matters, such as security notices and updates about changes to our policies, and to investigate and help prevent security issues.
We do not sell your personal data.
Location of Centercode Customer Data; Third-Party Sub-Processors
The Customer Data is located or processed by Centercode as described in our third-party sub-processors list available
here
. We do not control how our Centercode Customer processes the Customer Data, including the country or countries to which any Centercode Customer transfers the Customer Data. The United States and such other countries may not offer the same legal protections offered in your country of residence and may be considered by your country to offer insufficient legal protections.
Security of Centercode Customer Data
We maintain a written security policy for the security, integrity, and protection of the Customer Data against unauthorized disclosure or loss. We have physical, technical, and organizational processes and measures in place designed to safeguard this data. When accessing the Centercode Platform via a supported web browser, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to protect information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure the data is safe and secure in transit. Data stored on the Centercode Platform is encrypted at rest using AES-256.
We host the Centercode Platform on cloud-based servers located in a secure data center environment using a firewall and other advanced technology designed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. The Centercode Platform requires verified email addresses, unique usernames, and strong passwords for account authentication.
Other Information – Cookies and Log Data on the Centercode Platform
In addition to Customer Data, we collect the following cookies and log data (“
Other Information
”) automatically when you access and use the services. When you access your account on the Centercode Platform, the platform uses mandatory session cookies to grant you access to, and secure, your account. These cookies allow the Centercode Platform to uniquely identify you following the entry of your username and password so that you can access your account. Session cookies are required in order to use the Centercode Platform.
In addition, when you log into an account, our servers automatically log typical HTTP information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, a unique device identifier (a UUID), your device name, operating system type and version, network type, country of origin, account use information (e.g. the pages viewed, the links clicked, the dates and times of requests and referral URL, and other actions taken), error messages received, problems encountered, and similar data.
If you are an end user with access to the Centercode Support role, you have access to additional features including our in-platform chat feature and in-platform guidance and support. In connection with these support features, we have cookies that track you within the platform. These cookies provide analytics information for our internal use and do not track these supported users outside of the platform.
Finally, we use Google Analytics cookies with anonymization to analyze how our end users interact with the Centercode Platform (Starter Edition, Beta Edition, and Delta Editions only). The information generated about your usage is transmitted to Google as anonymized and is used to compile statistical reports on activity on the Centercode Platform to help us improve the Centercode Platform and your experience. The information we receive from Google Analytics is likewise anonymized data and we cannot use it to individually identify any particular visitor or user. We encourage you to read the
Google Privacy Policy
. You can opt out of these cookies
here
.
We use Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our services and business. More specifically, we may use it to provide services and customer support, including for user authentication, user support, service security and performance, fraud monitoring and prevention, and security audits. We also use Other Information as required by applicable law, legal process, or regulation. Where requested by the Centercode Customer, we may share log data with Centercode Customers for audit, compliance, investigations, and customer support purposes. We also use Other Information, such as de-identified and aggregated log data gathered about the general use of our services, for internal business purposes, such as developing and enhancing our products and services, identifying usage trends, and for other legitimate business purposes.
A Centercode Customer can configure its Centercode Platform Implementation and emails that come from its Implementation to add additional cookies or institute other methods of passive information collection or tracking technologies, such as web beacons, clear gifs, and similar technologies. The Centercode Customer is responsible for its use of these technologies and is responsible for any required privacy disclosures.
The Centercode Platform currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” browser signals.
Retention of Centercode Customer Data and Other Information
We will retain Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of our Centercode Customer, including in the Customer Contract, and as required by applicable law. Deleted or updated Customer Data stored in our backup systems will be automatically deleted or updated within a reasonable period during Centercode’s backup procedures, except as otherwise required by applicable law.
We may retain Other Information for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy. This can include keeping Other Information after a Centercode Customer has deactivated its account and/or after you have removed your account for the period needed for us to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
Centercode Platform Use Requirements
Authorized Users are required to comply with the
Centercode Platform Terms of Use for End Users
. We require Centercode Customers to comply with all applicable laws governing the collection, use, and sharing of personal data, including law governing the collection of personal data from minors. Please contact us immediately at
privacy@centercode.com
if you learn that any Centercode Platform Implementation holds the information of minors in violation of applicable law.
Links to Third-Party Sites
The Centercode Customer’s Implementation and emails that come from the Implementation may contain links to our Centercode Customer’s other websites and websites of other third parties on the Internet. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of such third parties.
Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies and personal data collection, use, and disclosure practices (including the data security practices) of these third parties, including Centercode Customers.
Link to Betabound.com
Certain editions of the Centercode Platform (the Starter, Beta, and Delta editions) may contain a link to Centercode’s
Betabound.com
community of interested test participants. Please note that if you visit Betabound.com, the
Betabound Privacy Policy
will apply.
Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to change this policy. If we make changes to it, you will find the revised policy posted
here
, along with the effective date of the revised policy. Your use of and access to the Centercode Platform after any changes become effective will be considered your acceptance of those changes and will constitute your agreement to be bound by the new or modified policy.
European Personal Data and International Data Transfers
We offer Centercode Customers a
Data Processing Addendum
that includes provisions to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “
GDPR
”), including as adopted by the United Kingdom, and standard contractual data protection clauses for the cross-border transfer of personal data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to the United States. The Centercode Customer determines its Authorized Users and therefore it is the Centercode Customer’s obligation to ensure that it has entered into the Data Processing Addendum (or an appropriate data processing addendum including valid standard contractual data protection clauses) with Centercode. Centercode Customers whose data collection practices are subject to the GDPR can find more information on our
GDPR and Centercode
page.
“Controller” and “Processor”
In certain jurisdictions, data protection law (including the GDPR) differentiates between the “data controller” and the “data processor” of personal data. Each Centercode Customer, as the owner of its Customer Data, is the “data controller” with respect to its Customer Data. The Centercode Customer determines its own data privacy policies and practices for its Implementation of the Centercode Platform and for the Customer Data. We are the “data processor” with respect to the Centercode Customer Data and the “data controller” with respect to Other Information.
Personal Data Requests
Individuals residing in certain localities, including the European Union, the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (“
European Residents
”) and consumers in certain US states may have certain statutory rights regarding their personal data. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, individuals with these rights may have rights including the right to request access to, or information about, their personal data, or seek to update, delete, or correct their personal data. You can use the features available within the Centercode Platform to perform many of these tasks. Where you are unable to do so, you must contact the Centercode Customer for any assistance that you require with your information that is Customer Data.
You may contact us at
privacy@centercode.com
regarding any request relating to Other Information that is personal data and may contact us if you require assistance getting in touch with our Centercode Customer. When you make a request to us, for your protection we may need to verify your identity prior to implementing any request. We will respond to your request promptly, and in no more than 30 days from your request, subject to applicable law.
Any European Resident who is dissatisfied with the handling of a request regarding his or her personal data within the scope of the GDPR has a right to lodge a complaint with his or her local data protection authority responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide

To meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
Examples of processing activities:
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process.
Legal obligations sometimes require us to retain certain information for purposes like financial record-keeping, such as information about a payment you’ve made to Google for tax or accounting purposes.
Various laws and regulations require us to put in place measures to confirm that our users are old enough to use our services. To help determine your age, we process the date of birth you provide. We also process information about your activity in our services, both when you’re signed in to a Google Account or signed out, and use machine learning technology to determine if you are likely over 18. In certain cases, if we cannot confirm that you are old enough to use our services by other means, we can request other information to verify your age, like your government ID, credit card, a photo of you, or your phone number.
The information processed will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
Things you create or provide to us
:
Content you create, upload, or receive (like photos, videos, emails, docs and spreadsheets).

My Activity
.
Location information
, such as may be determined by GPS, IP address, and other data from sensors on or around your device, depending in part on your device and account settings.
Information from publicly accessible sources
, such as information that’s publicly available online (like if your name appears in a local newspaper article) or from other public sources.
Information from our trusted partners
, such as from directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, or security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.
The legal grounds for processing this information will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
When necessary for our
legitimate interests
and those of third parties, including to:
Enforce legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service.
For example, analyzing content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our services.
For example, collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services

We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about

the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer support.
2.3 To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services. We use professional data, log files, and usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services to develop and improve our products and services.

HubSpot Terms Tip: Please see the "
Opt out of HubSpot's machine learning data use"
knowledge base article to learn more about how your Customer Data is being used to train HubSpot models.
2.4 To Secure and Protect our Product and HubSpot Users. We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user accounts, new product sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. This includes enforcing our
Acceptable Use Policy
.
We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns, investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes we associate automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you such as name, email address, address, and phone number.
2.5 To Market and Promote the Subscription Service. We use Personal Data to advertise, market, and promote our products, services, and other offerings. For example, we use information like your email or physical address to send information or HubSpot content to you we think may be of interest to you, including by post, email, or other means.  We may also send you marketing communications relating to our business.
You may opt out of receiving this promotional content by following the instructions contained in each communication that we send to you. If you unsubscribe from our marketing lists, we will continue to contact you regarding administrative matters, and to respond to your requests.
We may reach out to you via telephone to ask about other HubSpot products or services you may be interested in.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.
If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).

In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies and standards.

In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.
3.5 Public Forums. Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums (e.g., HubSpot Community, Connect.com, etc.). Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums (including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information) it may be read, collected and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you may disclose in this way. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if you so request, as described in the"Your Privacy Rights and Choices" section of this Privacy Notice. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information; we will let you know if we are unable to and why, if permitted.
3.6 Compelled Disclosure.

Customers may use this information for their sales and marketing activities. We rely on our legitimate interests, as well as those of our customers, to collect and share data for the purposes listed.

. HOW WE TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA INTERNATIONALLY

With respect to personal data received from or transferred to Canada, HubSpot is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Please contact us if you need more information about the legal mechanisms we rely on to transfer personal data outside the EEA, Switzerland, Canada, and UK.
4.3 Data Privacy Framework Notice. HubSpot complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively “the Data Privacy Framework”).

In the context of an onward transfer, HubSpot is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. HubSpot will remain liable under the DPF Principles if our agent processes your Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless HubSpot is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Please note that under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data

Identifiers
Commercial information
Financial information
Internet or other electronic activity information
Geolocation information
Professional or employment information
By “our business purposes,” we mean that we only disclose personal data as we describe in the section "
How We Disclose Personal Data
" above.  Also, as described in the “How We Use Cookies & Other Tracking technologies” section below, we process personal data to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ websites and mobile apps. Some of these activities may be considered “sharing” or “targeted advertising” under certain laws. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.
You also have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Privacy Notice or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
You may have additional rights under our
Binding Corporate Rules
in the EU. For example, where you believe your personal data has been transferred by an EU-based Twilio company to our US headquarters and processed by the US company in breach of the Binding Corporate Rules, you may have a right to:
Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.
If Twilio processes your personal data as a data processor on behalf of a customer, we will either direct you to contact our customer to exercise your rights.

Similarly, after you close your account, we will retain data — including personal data — associated with your account that we are required to maintain for legal purposes or for necessary business operations (see “
How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.
Identity Verification

Thereafter, we will process your request and inform you of any decisions we have made about your request.  Additionally, you may exercise your privacy rights through an authorized agent. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com

Twilio Product Privacy
Twilio offers a range of industry-leading communications and customer data platform services to our customers. Depending on the Service, Twilio may be a data controller and data processor of personal data used to provide the Services.
Twilio processes personal data (Communications Usage Data and Customer Content) for most of our Services as a data processor acting on the instruction of our customer and in accordance with the terms of our agreement with a customer, our
Data Protection Addendum
, and service specific terms. Our Services provide customers with ways to control, access and secure their data.
We also offer customers the ability to store, delete, access, or exercise other choices about their personal data. The ability to make these choices depends on the Service being used and how it is being used by a customer. Customers are referred to our
API docs
for each of our Services, along with SendGrid’s

Authy
The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.

Summary of our Privacy Policy
It covers every Zoho website that links here, and all of the products and services contained on those websites. The
detailed policy
follows the same structure as this summary and constitutes the actual legal document.
Our privacy commitment: Zoho has never sold your information to someone else for advertising, or made money by showing you other people's ads, and we never will. This has been our approach for almost 25 years, and we remain committed to it. This policy tells you what information we collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it, and what you can do about it.
Last updated on:
5th June 2023.
Part I – Information Zoho collects and controls
We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information, but we don't store credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our secured payment gateways).
When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.
Sometimes we receive information indirectly. If you ask about our products through one of our referral programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your contact information to us. We'll use that information to complete the request that you made. If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and profile information. We'll still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site.
What we do with your information
We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.
We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us. When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.
You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable non-essential and intrusive third-party cookies from all Zoho websites and products.
We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you.
The European Economic Area (EEA) provides certain rights to data subjects (including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object and to complain). Zoho undertakes to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live.
We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.
Part II – Information that Zoho processes on your behalf
If you handle other people's data using Zoho apps, such as information about your customers or employees, you are entrusting that data to us for processing. If you use a Zoho mobile app and give the app access to your contacts and photo library, you are entrusting data to us. The data you entrust to us for processing is called service data.
You own your service data. We protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions. You may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.
We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use Zoho Services. After you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that.
If you are in the European Economic Area and you believe that someone has entrusted your information to us for processing (for instance, your employer or a company whose services you use), you can request certain actions from us regarding your data. To exercise those data rights, please contact the person or company that entrusted the data to us and we will work with them on your request.
Part III – General
There are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you. We will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety. We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers; when a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it.
Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties.
You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums. You can also check our
Security Policy
and
Privacy Policy
We will contact you to let you know if we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.
Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy statement is made by the Zoho Group consisting of all the entities listed
here
(collectively, "Zoho", "we", "us" or "our").
Zoho’s Privacy Commitment
Zoho has worried about customer and user privacy for almost 25 years, long before it became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding to take such a position. We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.
The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to all Zoho websites that link to it. It also applies to the products and services provided by Zoho through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by Zoho on Zoho’s online marketplace and in other third-party online marketplaces. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Part I – Information Zoho collects and controls
This part deals with how Zoho collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of Zoho's products and services, and others who contact Zoho through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.
Part II – Information that Zoho processes on your behalf
This part deals with how Zoho handles data that you entrust to Zoho when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.
Part III – General
This part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as Zoho's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.
Part I – Information Zoho collects and controls
What information Zoho collects
We collect information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate purpose. Zoho will have information about you only if (a) you have provided the information yourself, (b) Zoho has automatically collected the information, or (c) Zoho has obtained the information from a third party. Below we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those three categories and the information collected in each one.
Information that you provide us
i.
Account signup
: When you sign up for an account to access one or more of our services, we ask for information like your name, contact number, email address, company name and country to complete the account signup process. You'll also be required to choose a unique username and a password for accessing the created account. You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we don’t require that information to sign up for an account. After signing up, you will have the option of choosing a security question and an answer to the security question — if you provide these, they will be used only while resetting your password.
ii.
Event registrations and other form submissions:
We record information that you submit when you (i) register for any event, including webinars or seminars, (ii) subscribe to our newsletter or any other mailing list, (iii) submit a form in order to download any product, whitepaper, or other materials, (iv) participate in contests or respond to surveys, or (v) submit a form to request customer support, get a quote or to contact Zoho for any other purpose.

We do not store the actual credit card number. For quick processing of future payments, if you have given us your approval, we may store your credit card information or other payment information in an encrypted format in the secured servers of our Payment Gateway Service Providers.
iv.
Testimonials
: When you authorize us to post testimonials about our products and services on websites, we may include your name and other personal information in the testimonial.

Legal bases for collecting and using information
Legal processing bases applicable to Zoho
: If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for information collection and use depends on the personal information concerned and the context in which we collect it. Most of our information collection and processing activities are typically based on (i) contractual necessity, (ii) one or more legitimate interests of Zoho or a third party that are not overridden by your data protection interests, or (iii) your consent. Sometimes, we may be legally required to collect your information, or may need your personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
Withdrawal of consent
: Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
Legitimate interests notice
: Where we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis and those legitimate interests are not specified above, we will clearly explain to you what those legitimate interests are at the time that we collect your information.
Your choice in information use
Opt out of non-essential electronic communications
: You may opt out of receiving newsletters and other non-essential messages by using the ‘unsubscribe’ function included in all such messages. However, you will continue to receive essential notices and emails such as account notification emails (password change, renewal reminders, etc.), security incident alerts, security and privacy update notifications, and essential transactional and payment related emails.
