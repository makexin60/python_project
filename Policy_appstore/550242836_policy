Disclosure of Personal Data to third parties
The APA member and affiliate directories are available only to members and affiliates in a members-only section of the site. All members’ and affiliates’ names are listed in the directory, but members have the option to suppress all other information. Personal Data collected as a function of the APA Digital Assets will not be released to third parties except to further the purpose for which you provided the Personal Data and in the following instances:
To fulfill a service to you including answering questions, completing an order or to follow through on a sweepstakes entry.
To send you invitations for events or newsletters, or to enable you to link a social media profile.
To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your Personal Data for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes. These parties may use your Personal Data to contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or they may use such Personal Data for their own research, administration or business purposes. If you do not want us to share your Personal Data in this manner, let us know.
To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our APA Digital Assets and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on APA's behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the Personal Data for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible.
To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on APA Digital Assets, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing address and other Personal Data related to such purchase, and we may use such collected Personal Data in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such Personal Data to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card).

To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
To track and analyze de-identified and aggregate usage and volume statistical data from our users and provide such Personal Data to third parties.
To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the Personal Data collected from APA Digital Assets. In the course of such verification, we may receive Personal Data about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card data and address matches the Personal Data that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.
Sale of Personal Data
To personalize our ads and marketing experiences, we work with advertising and analytics partners and social media sites. These partnerships may be considered a “sale” under Colorado law, even when no money exchanges hands.
The Personal Data we might “sell” includes your identifiers, online activity information, and customer records. When you login to your account on a web page or interact with APA Digital Assets where cookies are present, that may be considered a “sale” of your Personal Data. If you want to opt out of this use, please
contact us
.
We do not sell the personal data of children under the age of 16.
Third party websites and advertisers
APA Digital Assets may provide you with links to other websites, although we do not necessarily advise that you are linking to another website. In the event you choose to access such websites, APA is not responsible for any actions or policies of those sites. Further, please note that the third party's Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy or security practices may differ from APA. APA neither assumes responsibility for, nor does it control, endorse or guarantee any aspect of your use of the linked site. We recommend that you check the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy and other pertinent security practices of such a party before providing Personal Data to it. For information on advertising and third-party cookies, as well as links to opt-out, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Forums, chat rooms and other public posting areas
Please note that any Personal Data you include in a message you post to any chat room, online community, forum or other public posting area is available to others. If you don't want people to know your email address, for example, don't include it in any message you post publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY PERSONAL DATA IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS, ONLINE COMMUNITIES, AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.

How we respond to do not track signals
The “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) privacy preference is an option that may be made in some web browsers allowing you to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services.

Right to withdraw consent:
If we rely on your consent to process your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your prior consent.

How we protect your Personal Data
We maintain reasonable risk-based physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect against unauthorized and accidental disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction of Personal Data in our possession, and to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our systems, data, and services. We restrict access to Personal Data to those individuals and third parties that need to know the information to accomplish the business purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We are committed to taking appropriate measures to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we comply with applicable law for protecting Personal Data.
We provide reasonable security controls to protect electronic Personal Data that we receive from you against foreseeable hazards, but please note that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to us is done at your own risk. If we learn of a security system breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

We may post a notice via our APA Digital Assets if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
