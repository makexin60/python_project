If you reside in the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") regarding your Personal Information.
2. What does this privacy statement cover?
This Privacy Statement covers Bunpo's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Bunpo collects when you access or use the Service.
3. What personal information does Bunpo collect?
Bunpo collects information you voluntarily submit to the Service, such as, the information we collect when you register for an account: your name, email address, etc.
omatically receive and store certain, anonymous types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Such information may include the user's IP address, domain server, and type of Internet browser. This information helps us, among other things, analyze trends and administer the Service. This information is anonymous and contains no personally identifiable data.
Do Not Track Policy. Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.
4. What about children?
The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us. If you reside in the EU, United Kingdom, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you must be 16 years old or older to use the Services. Otherwise, all users must be 13 years of age or older. Anyone not meeting these age requirements is considered a "Minor" and is prohibited from signing up for or using the Service. If you are a Minor, do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a Minor, we will delete that information promptly. If you believe a Minor has provided us with personal information, please contact us at help@bunpo.app. We reserve the right to require users to verify their age and, if timely verification is not provided, to terminate the account and delete all personally identifiable information.
5. How does Bunpo use the information it collects?

To the limited extent we collect Personal Information, we do not rent or sell it to anyone. We share Personal Information only as described below.
Service Providers and Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform tasks on our behalf, such as third-party payment processing and hosting parts of the Service. These providers/agents may access your information to provide our services or customer support. Unless otherwise specified, Bunpo's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information beyond what is necessary to assist us.
Business Transfers: In some cases, we may decide to buy or sell assets, and in such transactions, customer information is typically included as one of the business assets transferred. Additionally, if Bunpo or a substantial portion of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Bunpo ceases operations or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be among the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that these transfers may occur, and any acquirer of Bunpo may continue to use your personal information as outlined in this policy.

8. Third party websites/services
The Site may allow you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Site. These other websites are not under Bunpo's control, and such links do not constitute an endorsement by Bunpo of those websites or the services they offer. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Service are not covered by this Privacy Statement, and Bunpo is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.
9. GDPR
In this GDPR section, we use the terms "Personal Data" and "processing" as defined in the GDPR. "Personal Data" typically refers to information that can identify an individual, and "processing" encompasses actions related to data, such as collection, use, storage, and disclosure. Bunpo will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Sites. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers' end users or employees in connection with providing services to customers, in which case we act as the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party first to address your rights concerning such data.
If any conflicts arise between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that offers greater protection to Personal Data will prevail to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether it applies to you, please contact us at help@bunpo.app.
