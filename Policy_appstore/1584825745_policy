Launch: Web Inspector for iOS
21 September 2021
Web Inspector
is now available in the App Store ü•≥!
Web Inspector is a Safari extension on iOS and iPadOS that works like
its desktop counterpart
but is less powerful. It allows web developers to edit web pages on the fly, debug JavaScript, and more.
Web Inspector Pricing
Web Inspector is free, with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking. You can
get it in the App Store
today. I hope you find it useful üôè.
Web Inspector Privacy Policy
Web Inspector does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
Web Inspector Support
Traditional support is not offered, but I welcome feedback on
Mastodon
