Snap One Law Enforcement Guidelines
‍
These guidelines are intended for use by government and law enforcement agencies when seeking information about Snap One customers from Snap One LLC, or its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Snap One”).
‍
Other requests for information, including customer questions about information disclosure and data rights should be directed to Snap One’s Data Protection Office at dpo@snapone.com.
‍
Required Legal Process
Snap One will not release user information to law enforcement except in response to a valid and binding legal request properly served on Snap One. Snap One reserves the right to object to legal requests it determines to be overbroad or inappropriate.  Snap One cannot respond to vague, invalid, or informal requests. If Snap One cannot uniquely identify the Snap One account based on your request, it will not be able to preserve information or produce records.
‍
Additionally, Snap One also reviews all legal process and requests to ensure they are not objectionable for other reasons, such as requests that seek confidential, proprietary information, or privileged information.
‍
Snap One distinguishes between content and non-content information. We do not produce content information in response to subpoenas. We may produce non-content and content information in response to valid and binding search warrants.  Requests and questions should be sent to legal@snapone.com.
‍
“Non-content” means end user information such as name, address, email address, billing information, date of account creation, and certain purchase history and service usage information.
‍
“Content” means the content of data files stored in an end user’s account such as videos and audio recordings. By default, end user video and audio information is not stored on Snap One servers. End users may sign up for additional services that temporarily store content on Snap One servers. For information on the retention policies for those services, see the terms and conditions for those services.
‍
Requests from Non-U.S. Law Enforcement
Non-U.S. law enforcement seeking to obtain data from Snap One must work through the available legal and diplomatic channels in its jurisdiction, including through bi-lateral or multi-lateral legal assistance treaties (“MLATs”) or letters rogatory processes. Such international requests may be made to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of International Affairs.
‍
Methods of Service
Snap One accepts service of information requests electronically or when personally delivered to the address below. Legal requests may be served by emailing requests to legal@snapone.com.
‍
Business address:
Snap One, LLC
Attn: Legal
11734 S. Election Road
Salt Lake City, UT 84020
‍
Other Information
Preservation
. Upon receipt of a lawful and binding request Snap One will preserve requested information for up to 90 days unless Snap One receives a preservation extension, in which case the information will be preserved for an additional 90 days (for a total of up to 180 days). See 18 USC 2703(f). If Snap One does not receive a request for extension or formal legal process by the end of the 90-day preservation period, the preserved information may be deleted. Please note that the preservation process may be rejected if the data to be preserved is not clearly specified and/or the details required to locate the data are not provided.
‍
Notification
. Unless Snap One is prohibited from doing so or has clear indication of illegal conduct in connection with the use of Snap One products or services, Snap One will notify end users before disclosing user information.
‍
Reimbursement
. Snap One may seek reimbursement for costs associated with responding to law enforcement requests for information, particularly if the costs incurred are the result of responding to burdensome or unique requests.
‍
Testimony
. Snap One does not provide expert testimony. Additionally, Snap One’s records are self-authenticating and should not require the testimony of a records custodian. If required and requested, Snap One may be able to provide a special form of certification for the records produced or a time/date stamp for videos.  Please contact legal@snapone.com for more information.

Inactive Customer Account Policy
‍
Snap One offers various services where customers may register for and manage a customer account, including Control4, Luma, and OvrC Connect (“Customer Account”).
‍
An “Inactive Customer Account” is an account that has not been used within a one-year period. Snap One reserves the right to suspend an Inactive Customer Account. When an account is suspended, the customer will be required to contact Snap One Customer Support to re-activate the account. All programming and account data will be retained for Inactive Customer Accounts and can be accessed upon reactivation.
If an Inactive Customer Account remains inactive for an additional period of one year, totaling at least two consecutive years of inactivity, Snap One reserves the right to permanently delete the account and its activity, as well as any related data stored with Snap One. Snap One also reserves the right to permanently delete accounts that have been inactive for a period of greater than two years.
‍
January 1, 2024 is the earliest a Customer Account will be deleted under this policy.
‍
‍
How Snap One Defines Activity
‍
A Customer Account that directs activity and connects with Snap One cloud systems is considered
active
. This includes any activity using your Customer Account that requires an internet connection, including the following actions:
‍
Controller check-ins
Use of the Control4, OvrC Connect, or Luma mobile apps
Web-enabled third party drivers that authenticate your local system to the cloud (e.g., Alexa or Google integration with Control4)
Remote access and system configuration by a certified Control4 dealer
Customer Account activity is demonstrated by account and not by device. You can demonstrate activity on any device where you’re signed into your Customer Account (e.g., iPhone or Android).
‍
Notification
‍
30 days before your Customer Account is suspended or deleted, you will receive notice from Snap One informing you of the impending change. Notice will be sent to the email account associated with your Customer Account. Logging in or connecting to the internet at any point during the 30-day period after notification will automatically reactivate your account.
‍
If your Customer Account is not reactivated within the 30-day period after receiving notice, Snap One reserves the right to suspend your Customer Account for a one-year period. If it remains suspended for an additional year, Snap One reserves the right to delete your Customer Account.
‍
Accounts Not Connected to the Internet
‍
Even where a Customer Account is inactive or deleted and not connected to the internet, your products and system may still be used locally. This could include local control of shades, lighting, local audio, TV control, and scheduling. However, if you wish to connect your products to the internet, you will need to create a new Customer Account or reactivate your Inactive Customer Account.
‍
Contact
‍
For any inquiries or concerns regarding this policy or the status of a Customer Account, please contact Snap One’s Customer Support team at customers@SnapOne.com.
