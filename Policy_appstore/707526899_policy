you (the "Recordings").
One or more of the Applications may also include the functionality for you to post

Other Disclosures
We may occasionally release a Recording when release is appropriate to comply with
law or to protect the rights, property or safety of other licensees of the Applications, the
public, customers, or us, and our employees, agents, partners, affiliates, and associates. If
we were to merge with another entity or otherwise reorganize, the Recordings may be
transferred to the reorganized entity. You agree that we may make such disclosures and
agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for such disclosure.

If you wish to upload, transmit, share, and/or disclose Recordings to others via SMS or
MMS message, please note that standard text messaging rates or other carrier charges
may apply to such use.
Third Parties
If you choose to record, save, upload, synchronize, transmit, share and/or disclose
Recordings to others through third party content providers, including posting links to
the Recordings to one or more third party social networking sites ("Third Party Sites"),
you do so at your sole risk. We do not control the Third Party Sites and are not
responsible for their content. Functionality in the Applications to allow such recording,
saving, uploading, synchronizing, transmission, sharing and/or disclosing of Recordings
to others through Third Party Sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on
the Third Party Sites or any association with their operators. Other sites and service
providers follow different rules regarding the use and disclosure of personally
identifiable information and data that you submit to them. Please review the privacy
policies, terms of use, and/or terms of service from Third Party Sites you may wish to
use.

disclosure of personally identifiable information and data that you submit to them.
