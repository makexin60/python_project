(“ABBYY,” “we” or “us”) has provided this Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) on websites (the “Websites” or the “Sites”) that were created to provide a platform for sales, registration, and support for ABBYY's optical character recognition, process intelligence, data capture, linguistics, and translation products and services.
ABBYY is committed to maintaining your privacy. Privacy Notice outlines our privacy practices, including the types of information that you may provide to us, how we use such information and the choices you have regarding our use of that information. We may collect the information through our Websites or our mobile apps (“Apps”); when you purchase, register or use our products through computers or mobile devices; through our online support services; or through email messages that we send to you (collectively, including all online methods, the “Services”), or offline, such as when you attend one of our trade shows or contact our customer service line. Our Privacy Notice applies to (i) casual visitors to our Sites (including whose who request information on our Websites via web-forms), who do not participate in the Services (“Sites Visitors”), (ii) individuals who purchase or register products through Websites or otherwise participate in our Services (“Registered Users”), (iii) users of our products and (iv) individuals whose information we obtain offline (collectively, including Sites Visitors, Registered Users, users of products, and other individuals, “you”).
1. Notice.
1.1. The Types of Information You May Provide
Information you may provide or that we may collect from you while visiting our Sites or while participating in our Services falls into three broad categories: (i) Personally Identifiable Information, (ii) Activities Information, and (iii) Anonymous Information.
2. General; Exceptions.
Providing your Personally Identifiable Information to us through the Services confirms your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Notice.

You can opt-out of receiving bulletins, updates, the ABBYY newsletter, or other marketing-related materials by clicking on the unsubscribe on the bottom of each marketing e-mail.
2.2. Exception for Administrative Messages.
Please understand that if you choose not to receive marketing-related messages from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, such as notices concerning operation of Websites or other Services, products you have purchased, downloaded or registered for, and legal and other related notices concerning your relationship with ABBYY and Sites. You cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.
3. Collection, Use and Sharing of Information.
3.1. Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information.
We and certain service providers operating on our behalf collect Personally Identifiable Information from you. Personally Identifiable Information may be collected as part of the normal operation of our products and Services, for example, when contained in data that you or we capture, convert or translate using our products or in connection with your use of other features of our Services. For the 12-month period prior to the date of this Privacy Notice, the following explains the Personally Identifiable Information that is collected, where we got it from, why it is needed, and with whom we shared it:
3.2 Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, ABBYY and the Sites do not recognize DNT.
3.3. Additional Uses of Personally Identifiable Information.
In addition to the categories of recipients identified above, we may use and share the categories of Personally Identifiable Information identified above as follows:
3.3.1. Administrative Communications.
We may send administrative information to you, for example, information regarding the Services and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
3.3.2. Other Business Purposes.
We use Personally Identifiable Information for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying our Services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities.
3.3.3. To Protect Our Rights.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our Affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our Affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
3.3.4. Transfer of Assets.
ABBYY may transfer to a third party information it collects, including any Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with a sale or other corporate transaction of all or substantially all of the assets of the business entity responsible for the information under this Notice.
3.3.5. Aggregate or Anonymous Non-Personal Information.
We may also share or sell non-identifiable aggregate or anonymous information with our Affiliates, agents, service providers, business partners, or other third parties for their marketing or analytics uses or for other lawful purposes. This type of non-identifiable and aggregate information cannot be used to identify you personally.
4. Security.
We have put in place security systems designed to reasonably protect against unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us, and we take reasonable steps to secure and safeguard this Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with
Section 11
(Contact Us).
5. Quality / data integrity.
We rely on you to provide us complete and accurate personal information and to contact us if correction of such information is required.

ABBYY is committed to maintaining your privacy.  This Privacy Notice (“
Privacy Notice
”) outlines our privacy practices, including the types of information that you may provide to us, how we use such information and the choices you have regarding our use of that information.  We may collect the information through our Website; when you purchase, register or use our products through computers or mobile devices; through our online support services; or through email messages that we send to you (collectively, including all online methods, the “
