Privacy Policy for ID Prove 300 OTP
Latest update: March 8, 2017
1- Who we are
Gemalto Pte (Ltd) a company organized under the laws of Singapore.
2- What we do
We have developed this mobile application based on a One-Time Password (OTP) technology allowing a secure and convenient authentication to internet services via an OTP server.
3- Location of the OTP server?
Depending on the terms of the contract between us and your organization that acquires the OTP service, the OTP server can be located at the premises of your organization or in our data center located in Ottawa (Ontario - Canada).
4- Information collected by the Application
To activate the OTP service via the mobile application you will have to enter a PIN number, registration code, or OTP server URL. This information is entered by you to authenticate and to register to the OTP server of your organization. You also have the option to perform the activation via QR code.
5- Information that could be
automatically collected by the Application
Information automatically collected
Reasons for the automatic collection
Read phone status and identity
It allows to identify the phone and to derive some parameters used for security functions
Take picture and videos
It lets the app control the camera function on your phone. In theory this could be used maliciously to snap unsuspecting photos, but it would be unlikely and difficult to get a worthwhile picture or video. However, it is not impossible to make malicious use of cameras.
Modify, read or delete the content of the SD card
The SD card is used to store some logs used for debugging or maintenance purpose
Find accounts on the device
This is required by GCM service while getting a unique device ID.
View network connections
This is required for accessing ConnectivityManager (mainly for monitoring network connections in general)
View WiFi connections
Allows the app to view information about wi-fi networking, such as whether wi-fi is enabled.
Control flashlight
This allows apps to turn on or off the LED "flash" light used by the camera
Prevent phone from sleeping
This is required to keep processor from sleeping, in our case we are using WakefulBroadcastReceiver for handling push notifications, which keeps the processor from sleeping until the push notification message is processed.
6- Third parties access to information obtained by the Application
Third parties do not have access to the information obtained by the Application.
7- Sharing of data with third parties
We share information with your organization that has acquired the OTP service. We may also disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements (for example, in response to requests by federal, state or local authorities, including tax authorities, subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes) or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is legally required, enforce our policies, establish or exercise our legal rights or protect anyone's rights, property or safety.
8- Sharing of data for marketing purposes.
We do not share the data for marketing or advertising purpose.
9- Security and Retention
If your information is stored on our servers located in Ottawa (Ontario - Canada): we treat data as an asset that must be protected and use tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain private.
We retain information in accordance with the duration of the agreement with your organization. In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce the agreement and take other actions permitted by law.

Thales mobile Driver License (mDL) Privacy Policy Terms
Last update: June 2021
This document acts as Privacy Policy Terms for any Thales mobile Driver License (mDL) applications for the end user groups including citizens (using a Thales mDL app) and verifying entities (using a Thales mDL Verifier app). General Thales Privacy Policy information can be found at:
https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/privacy-notice
.
As Thales contracts directly with US State and/or Canadian Province jurisdictions for these services, a Thales mDL app may be branded under the Thales brand or under the individual State/Province identity along with a “by Thales” descriptor in the app name.
Device & App history
Does the mDL App allow someone to view one or more pieces of information about activity on the registered mobile device, such as which apps are running, browsing and bookmarks?
Answer: No. The mDL App does not provide access to, or information about, any activity on the individual’s mobile device.
Location
Does the mDL App use the device's location – either approximate (network based) or precise (GPS and network based)?
If yes, does the mDL App notify and obtain user consent before collecting, transmitting or using location data?
Answer: No. The mDL App does not use or track the device location.
Identity
Does the mDL App find a user’s account on the device? Is the mDL App able to add or remove accounts?
Answer: No. The mDL App does not use any accounts on the mobile device.
The mDL account created for the  users and/or verifying entities are managed at the DMV level when a person, or business, enrolls for the mDL and registers their mobile device into the DMV’s mDL ecosystem. This happens completely on the secure mDL backend systems and not on the individual mobile device.
Photos/media/files
Does the mDL App use one or more of: files on the mobile device such as images, videos or audio; the device's external storage?
Answer: The mDL App does not access the external storage or the user content except for the content managed by the mDL. The mDL App does access the mobile device’s camera during initial enrollment (if using remote enrollment processes), and to scan bar codes for verification.
Wi-Fi connection information
Does the mDL App allow for viewing information about Wi-Fi networking, such as whether Wi-Fi is enabled and names of connected devices?
Answer: No, this functionality is through the actual mobile device and not the mDL App.
Device ID & Call information
Does the mDL App provide information about the mobile phone number and device IDs, whether a call is active and the remote number connected by a call?
Answer: No. The mDL App is purely used as a digital form of identification, to verify an individual’s age, identity and/or driving privileges.
Analytics and data
Does the mDL App collect, record, and transmit any personal data?
Answer: No. The mDL App will only record and transmit anonymized, not personally identifiable, information for analytic, network performance, and quality of service purposes. No personally identifiable information is recorded or transmitted, including no key press information, no geolocation tagging, no contact information, no location information, etc.
App description
A Thales mDL App is provided in partnership with a State or Province Department of Motor Vehicles, currently as a companion form of ID to your physical driver’s license or ID card. If available in your State or Province, it can be used to verify age, identity, or driving privileges throughout the state and across the nation wherever mobile driver licenses are accepted.
Once available in your locale, you can request an mDL through your DMV. Upon successful enrollment and app download, you can begin using your mDL App. State or Province issued mDLs are legal forms of identification and can be used as a companion to your primary physical Driver’s License or ID card.
For more information on the mobile Driver’s License, please visit
https://justaskthales.com/us/the-mobile-drivers-license/

Rating
Do you assign an appropriate rating to the mDL App?
Answer: Each State or Province-specific mDL App will have its own rating; however, in general Thales mDL apps are assigned an “Everyone” rating for Android, and a “4+” rating for iOS.
