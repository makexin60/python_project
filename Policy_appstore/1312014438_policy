Privacy Policy
JSBox is an IDE for learning JavaScript on iOS, it aims to provide a safe sandbox for JavaScript executing, for educational purpose only.
This privacy policy applies to the iOS main app itself, its embedded frameworks and app extensions, and official examples we provided, but obviously not to scripts that you, the user, write yourself. Especially when using networking APIs, please be aware that other terms (of the API service provider) may apply.
JSBox is
not
designed to be a "platform" that allows you run arbitrary code, but rather as a learning environment for
your own
programs. In order to prevent malicious scripts, you are strongly encouraged to always check the code before running.
Data Collected by JSBox
In short, the JSBox app itself does not collect any data from you. Yes, we don't do any data tracking technology for "Growth Hacking" purpose, we don't even count how many users we have. We just want to provide a safe programming environment, and do not care how "success" we are, or how the app is being used by users.
But you should be careful about using some APIs that may request your data, such as location, calendar, and reminders. Especially when you are running a script that someone gave you, double-check it before running.
Other than that, please be confident about our service, all secrets stay on your device, we don't have control over it.
Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
JSBox does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code or libraries that may collect cookies to improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
