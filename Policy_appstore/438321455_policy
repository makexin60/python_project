Quality Optimizing
This is where the feedback loops kick in.
Once we have data, it’s time to start learning from it. Not all leads are equal, so we must begin the journey of maximizing high value, warm, qualified leads.
Insight Analysis
This is where the fun nerdy data stuff lives.
A test cycle on most ad platforms happens within 4-7 days. So once a week we have learnings. These compound over time to become a company asset for you.

Real Results
Target Cost Per Lead here is under $60. We are generating +1,000 leads at an average cost per lead of $40.52
This is a B2B Lead Generation Campaign, which tends to have higher costs than Direct to Customer
These Leads are VERY profitable for the company and they have a whole Sales Team to manage them
NOTE:
Results are not typical, and costs can very based on industry, business model and product/service offering

What they say?
“I couldn’t be happier that I met the Paul when I did. I am a strong believer in things happening for a reason, and the timing couldn’t have been better as we were just about coming to terms with the fact that we needed to restructure our business models.
Not only has Paul been involved in all of this, but he has been the architect behind many of the business models now at the heart of my companies. I value his advice and input almost as much as the results him and his team get us.
And I am not just saying this either, in fact, the guys started with us with one product in just one of my companies. I now have them overseeing all my products across all my companies, and I even have Paul on investment calls with me now when people are pitching me for investment. Mainly because Paul sees things that most people miss. I attribute this to his potent expertise across both Tech and Marketing, a combination which few have at his level.
I Couldn’t recommend these guys enough and they will be part of everything I do going forward.”

About Us
Who we are
“If your company lives and dies based on your lead pipeline, we’re Super Mario with a Power Up ready to take you to the next level!”
It’s Simple. We’ve built a FORMULA to scale businesses.
We’re not kidding here either. We actually have a formula. It’s taken many years to fine tune. But this formula has been battle-tested across many industries, with many different business models and sales cycles. It applies to ANY business.
We’ve actually challenged ourselves to find a business that it doesn’t work for. A model it can’t crack. We’ve yet to find one.
In saying that though, working with us to implement our Business Scaling Formula, is NOT for everyone. We know what works, and we know how to make it work. But in order for us to do that, YOU have to work with us, and the numbers need to make sense to justify our service. So let’s have a chat and see if it makes sense?
