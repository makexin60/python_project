Newsela Children & Student Privacy Policy
17. PRIVACY DISCLOSURES FOR CHILDREN AND STUDENTS
When our Services are used by providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, teachers, and authorized school users and administrators (collectively, “Schools”) for educational purposes, we collect and process Personal Information about students (“Student Data”) for and on behalf of the School as a School Official. Our collection and use of Student Data is governed by our contracts with the School (including, to the extent applicable, the
Newsela Terms of Use
), as well as by applicable student privacy laws such as FERPA, COPPA and state student data privacy laws. This Privacy Disclosures for Children and Students explains the principles we apply to our collection and use of Student Data. In the event of any conflict between the School contract and the practices set forth in these Privacy Disclosures for Children and Students, the School contract shall govern. Please contact your School if you have any questions about the School’s privacy practices.
a. Who does this apply to
These Privacy Disclosures for Children and Students describe how we collect, use, protect and process Personal Information from or about students, including children under 13, through the provision of the Services to a School.
b. Children Under 13
We do not permit children under 13 to create an account and do not knowingly collect personal information from a child under 13 unless the child is provided access to the Services by the child’s School or an authorized legal guardian for use in an educational setting (e.g., the child under 13 is a student of a School). When a School uses the Services in the classroom or educational context, we rely on the School to provide appropriate consent Newsela to collect Personal Information from a student under 13 for the use and benefit of the School and for no other commercial purpose, as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). If you are a parent, please continue reading this Privacy Policy for Children and Students to understand how your child’s information will be collected and used by Newsela on behalf of your child’s school. For purposes of this section, the term “Student Data” includes Personal Information of a child under 13 who uses the Services in connection with a School.
c. Student Data Principles
We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use Student Data for any purpose other than to provide the Services to the Schools and in accordance with any contractual agreements with the Schools.
As between us and the School, Student Data is owned and controlled by the School.
Our collection, use, and disclosure of Student Data is governed by our agreement with the applicable School, and by the provisions of FERPA, COPPA, and applicable state laws which relate to the collection of Student Data.
We collect, maintain, use and share Student Data only for an authorized educational purpose and as described in any contractual agreements with the School, or as directed by the School or the applicable educator, parent or guardian.
We do not use or disclose Student Data for targeted advertising purposes.
We do not build a personal profile from Student Data other than in furtherance of an educational purpose.
We maintain a data security program reasonably designed to protect Student Data.
We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users.
We will never sell Student Data unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Policy or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Data by deleting the Student Data before the transfer occurs.

f. How We Share and Disclose Student Data
We disclose Student Data solely as needed to provide the Services on behalf of specific Schools in accordance with our contractual agreements with those Schools. Please note that Student Data and teacher account usage data may be disclosed to or accessible by users who are authorized to use the Services on behalf of the School. Student Data may also be accessible to anyone who accesses your account with your login credentials. To avoid unauthorized access to Student Data, please do not distribute your login credentials and keep all login information secure.

g. How We Use De-Identified Student Data
We may collect and use De-Identified Data to operate, analyze, improve, market or develop educational sites, services or applications, to recommend content or services relating to school or educational purposes, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of our products or services. De-Identified Data means data from which all personally identifiable information, including direct and indirect identifiers, has been permanently removed or obscured so that the remaining information does not reasonably identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. If we share or publicly disclose De-Identified Data, that data will be aggregated or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific School or individual student.
h. How We Retain Student Data
We do not knowingly retain Student Data beyond the time period necessary to support the School’s educational purpose. We do not delete or de-identify any Student Data from an active student user account associated with a School except at the direction of the School.
Please note: Schools are responsible for maintaining current student rosters and identifying Student Data which the School no longer needs for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request. School users may contact us at privacy@newsela.com to request deletion of Student Data. Even if we do not receive a deletion request from a School, we may delete or de-identify Student Data after a period of inactivity in accordance with our standard data retention practices.
We may not be able to immediately or completely delete all data in all instances, such as information retained in technical support records, customer service records, backups, and other similar business records. We do not delete information which has been de-identified or disassociated with personal identifiers such that the remaining information cannot reasonably be used to identify a particular individual.
i. Access to Student Data
We provide a mechanism for Schools to allow parents and legal guardians to review Student Data upon request. If you are a student, or the parent or legal guardian of a student, please contact your School to submit a request to access, review or modify Student Data. We will work with the School upon the School’s request to help facilitate responses to these inquiries.
j. How we secure Student Data
We take our responsibility to protect your Personal Information seriously. We have implemented security measures designed to prevent your Personal Information from being lost, used, accessed, altered, or disclosed in an unauthorized or unlawful way. Additionally, Newsela implements required and optional data privacy and cybersecurity training for all employees upon onboarding and annually.
Please note, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot and do not guarantee that Personal Information is completely secure and safe from such risks. By using the Services, you understand and assume the risks associated with your activities on the Internet. We update our security practices upon advancements made in technology and enhancements to industry standards, for the most updated information on our security practices please contact us at
privacy@newsela.com
.
k. Changes and questions about Student Data
We may update the Policy from time to time. When we make material changes to this Policy, we will revise the “Last Revised” date above. All changes to this Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. If you have questions about specific practices relating to Student Data provided to Newsela by the applicable Schools, please direct your questions to your School or contact us at
privacy@newsela.com

Notice for California Residents
Last Revised:
July 01, 2024
‍
1. WHO DOES THIS POLICY APPLY TO
This Notice for California Residents (“CA Notice”) applies to you if you are a resident of the state of California. For purposes of this Notice, the term “Newsela,” “we”  and “our” relates to Newsela, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The term “Personal Information” has the meaning provided by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA"). Terms that are not defined in this CA Notice have the meaning set out in our
Privacy Policy
.
Please note this CA Notice does not apply to Student Data
that we process on behalf of our School customers. If you have any questions about Student Data, please review our
Privacy Policy
. You may also contact your School directly.
2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT & HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION
We collect Personal Information directly from you, from your browser, and/or device when you visit our
Service
, or from third parties that you permit to share information with us (e.g., if you create an account using a single sign-on service). In the last 12 months, the Personal Information we have collected may include: identifiers (such as your name, email address and birthdate), California Customer Records (Cal. Civ. Code §1798.89(e) such as your login credentials and phone number), internet/network information (such as device identifiers, logs and analytic data), and inferences based on your interests, preferences and usage of the Service. In the last 12 months, the “sensitive personal information” (as defined by the CPRA) we have collected may include: your account log-in, password, and if your School requires it, demographic data. Newsela does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purpose other than for performing services you have requested, for detecting security incidents, fraud and other illegal actions, or for short term transient use. Please refer to our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about the types of Personal Information we collect.
Additionally, in the last 12 months, as needed for business purposes, we have disclosed some Personal Information we collect to our service providers, advisors, and analytics providers. Please refer to our
Privacy Policy
for additional information on the ways we may share your Personal Information.
3. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
Residents of California may be entitled to certain rights with respect to Personal Information that we have collected about them under the CCPA/CPRA:
Right to Know and Access.
The right to request to know more about the specific pieces or categories of Personal Information we have collected, the categories of data sources, and the categories of third parties with whom we have shared the Personal Information for a business or commercial purpose in the last 12 months, and to access a copy of your Personal Information.
Right to Request Deletion.
The right to request the deletion of Personal Information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.
Right to Correction.
The right to request we correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, taking into account the nature of the data and the purposes for which we process that data.
Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information.
The right to direct us not to “sell” (as such term is defined by the CCPA) Personal Information we have collected about you to third parties or to “share” your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.
The right to direct us to only use your sensitive Personal Information for limited purposes, such as providing you with the services you requested.
You also have the right to be free of discrimination for exercising these rights. Note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our Services or engage with you in the same manner.
To request to exercise these rights, please submit a request by:
Filling out our
Privacy Rights Request Webform
or
Email us at
privacy@newsela.com
We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account, if you have one. In certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems, or as permitted by law.
You may authorize another person (your “agent”) to submit a California consumer rights request on your behalf. Authorized agents must submit the request via email to privacy@newsela.com and include a signed letter from the Newsela user confirming the agent has permission to submit the request on the user’s behalf. In certain circumstances, we may need to request additional information to verify the identity of the user about whom the request is being made and/or to verify that the user has provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request, and it may take additional time to fulfill agent-submitted requests. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we will direct future communications to the Newsela user on whose behalf the request was made. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.
4. RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active, authorized by your School, or for as long as is reasonably necessary to provide our Services. You can request your Personal Information to be deleted at any time by filling out our
Privacy Rights Request Webform
or emailing us at
privacy@newsela.com
.
5. ADDITIONAL NOTICES
Shine the Light. California "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section §1798.83) provides certain rights to California residents that have an established business relationship with us with regard to the disclosure of certain types of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without consent.
Minors. We do not sell the personal information of consumers we know to be less than 16 years of age.
6. CHANGES TO NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
We may update this CA Notice from time to time to reflect changes for operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please revisit this CA Notice regularly to stay informed about your rights. When we make material changes to the CA Notice, we will revise the Last Revised date at the top of this CA Notice. All changes to this CA Notice are effective when they are posted on this page.

Google Product Privacy Guide
How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar data collection technologies. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.

You may opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at
https://google.com/ads/preferences
. You may learn more about Google’s practices with Google Analytics by visiting Google’s privacy policy at
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners
. You can also view Google’s currently available opt-out options at

Browser Opt-Out:
You can access your personal browser tools to opt-out of behavioral and advertising activities. Please note that you will need to opt-out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these opt-out features.
You can prevent the use of certain tracking tools on a device-by-device basis by using the controls in your web browser.

Newsela Children & Student Privacy Policy
17. PRIVACY DISCLOSURES FOR CHILDREN AND STUDENTS
When our Services are used by providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, teachers, and authorized school users and administrators (collectively, “Schools”) for educational purposes, we collect and process Personal Information about students (“Student Data”) for and on behalf of the School as a School Official. Our collection and use of Student Data is governed by our contracts with the School (including, to the extent applicable, the
Newsela Terms of Use
), as well as by applicable student privacy laws such as FERPA, COPPA and state student data privacy laws. This Privacy Disclosures for Children and Students explains the principles we apply to our collection and use of Student Data. In the event of any conflict between the School contract and the practices set forth in these Privacy Disclosures for Children and Students, the School contract shall govern. Please contact your School if you have any questions about the School’s privacy practices.
a. Who does this apply to
These Privacy Disclosures for Children and Students describe how we collect, use, protect and process Personal Information from or about students, including children under 13, through the provision of the Services to a School.
b. Children Under 13
We do not permit children under 13 to create an account and do not knowingly collect personal information from a child under 13 unless the child is provided access to the Services by the child’s School or an authorized legal guardian for use in an educational setting (e.g., the child under 13 is a student of a School). When a School uses the Services in the classroom or educational context, we rely on the School to provide appropriate consent Newsela to collect Personal Information from a student under 13 for the use and benefit of the School and for no other commercial purpose, as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). If you are a parent, please continue reading this Privacy Policy for Children and Students to understand how your child’s information will be collected and used by Newsela on behalf of your child’s school. For purposes of this section, the term “Student Data” includes Personal Information of a child under 13 who uses the Services in connection with a School.
c. Student Data Principles
We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use Student Data for any purpose other than to provide the Services to the Schools and in accordance with any contractual agreements with the Schools.
As between us and the School, Student Data is owned and controlled by the School.
Our collection, use, and disclosure of Student Data is governed by our agreement with the applicable School, and by the provisions of FERPA, COPPA, and applicable state laws which relate to the collection of Student Data.
We collect, maintain, use and share Student Data only for an authorized educational purpose and as described in any contractual agreements with the School, or as directed by the School or the applicable educator, parent or guardian.
We do not use or disclose Student Data for targeted advertising purposes.
We do not build a personal profile from Student Data other than in furtherance of an educational purpose.
We maintain a data security program reasonably designed to protect Student Data.
We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users.
We will never sell Student Data unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Policy or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Data by deleting the Student Data before the transfer occurs.
d. Student Data We Collect
Student Data we collect Includes:
Contact Information
School, grade, and classroom affiliation
Birthdate
Demographic Information (only if required by your School and voluntarily provided)
Account Information
A photograph of yourself (only if voluntarily provided when you create your account)
Access and usage data about students’ use of the features and functionality of the Services

Information provided in response to surveys and promotions we make available to students (if any)
Student Data may include “educational records” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g).
e. How We Use Student Data
Our use of Student Data in accordance with our agreements with the School and subject to the School’s instructions and control. Generally, we use Student Data to operate, maintain and provide our Services to Schools and to support, improve and develop our educational product and service. This may include:
To permit teachers and other School users to monitor students’ engagement and performance, plan lessons and otherwise support instruction;
To provide teachers and School users with reports and education or product recommendations;
To customize the user experience;
For adaptive learning or customized student learning, including generating personalized learning recommendations and suggesting educational content or activities;
For analytics purposes, to understand how our Services are accessed and used and how they perform, so that we may improve design and functionality. We also collect analytics on aggregate information that does not identify any individual user; and
To diagnose problems, troubleshoot issues and provide maintenance and support.
For clarity, we do not use Student Data to: (i) advertise or market to students on our Services or to direct targeted online advertising to students on our Services, (ii) develop a profile of a student other than for the purpose of providing educational services or as authorized by School, or (iii) for any other commercial purpose unless authorized by School or permitted by applicable law.
f. How We Share and Disclose Student Data
We disclose Student Data solely as needed to provide the Services on behalf of specific Schools in accordance with our contractual agreements with those Schools. Please note that Student Data and teacher account usage data may be disclosed to or accessible by users who are authorized to use the Services on behalf of the School. Student Data may also be accessible to anyone who accesses your account with your login credentials. To avoid unauthorized access to Student Data, please do not distribute your login credentials and keep all login information secure.
In addition, depending on the manner in which the Services is used by the School and the terms of the agreement between the School and Newsela, we may provide access to certain Student Data to the student and/or to the parent or guardian of the student about whom the records relate, for the purpose of monitoring student usage and activity and evaluating the effectiveness of the School’s use of the Services. We also disclose Student Data to our trusted service providers who have a legitimate need to access such information on our behalf, subject to appropriate contractual terms to protect such data. Furthermore, we may disclose Student Data in connection with a business transaction or to support our legal rights and obligations, as described under the section entitled “Recipients of Personal Information” above.
g. How We Use De-Identified Student Data
We may collect and use De-Identified Data to operate, analyze, improve, market or develop educational sites, services or applications, to recommend content or services relating to school or educational purposes, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of our products or services. De-Identified Data means data from which all personally identifiable information, including direct and indirect identifiers, has been permanently removed or obscured so that the remaining information does not reasonably identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. If we share or publicly disclose De-Identified Data, that data will be aggregated or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific School or individual student.
h. How We Retain Student Data
We do not knowingly retain Student Data beyond the time period necessary to support the School’s educational purpose. We do not delete or de-identify any Student Data from an active student user account associated with a School except at the direction of the School.
Please note: Schools are responsible for maintaining current student rosters and identifying Student Data which the School no longer needs for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request. School users may contact us at privacy@newsela.com to request deletion of Student Data. Even if we do not receive a deletion request from a School, we may delete or de-identify Student Data after a period of inactivity in accordance with our standard data retention practices.
We may not be able to immediately or completely delete all data in all instances, such as information retained in technical support records, customer service records, backups, and other similar business records. We do not delete information which has been de-identified or disassociated with personal identifiers such that the remaining information cannot reasonably be used to identify a particular individual.
i. Access to Student Data
We provide a mechanism for Schools to allow parents and legal guardians to review Student Data upon request. If you are a student, or the parent or legal guardian of a student, please contact your School to submit a request to access, review or modify Student Data. We will work with the School upon the School’s request to help facilitate responses to these inquiries.
j. How we secure Student Data
We take our responsibility to protect your Personal Information seriously. We have implemented security measures designed to prevent your Personal Information from being lost, used, accessed, altered, or disclosed in an unauthorized or unlawful way. Additionally, Newsela implements required and optional data privacy and cybersecurity training for all employees upon onboarding and annually.
Please note, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot and do not guarantee that Personal Information is completely secure and safe from such risks. By using the Services, you understand and assume the risks associated with your activities on the Internet. We update our security practices upon advancements made in technology and enhancements to industry standards, for the most updated information on our security practices please contact us at

The right to request to know more about the specific pieces or categories of Personal Information we have collected, the categories of data sources, and the categories of third parties with whom we have shared the Personal Information for a business or commercial purpose in the last 12 months, and to access a copy of your Personal Information.
Right to Request Deletion.
The right to request the deletion of Personal Information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.
Right to Correction.
The right to request we correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, taking into account the nature of the data and the purposes for which we process that data.
Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information.
The right to direct us not to “sell” (as such term is defined by the CCPA) Personal Information we have collected about you to third parties or to “share” your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.
The right to direct us to only use your sensitive Personal Information for limited purposes, such as providing you with the services you requested.
You also have the right to be free of discrimination for exercising these rights. Note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our Services or engage with you in the same manner.
To request to exercise these rights, please submit a request by:
Filling out our
Privacy Rights Request Webform
or
Email us at
privacy@newsela.com
We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account, if you have one. In certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems, or as permitted by law.
You may authorize another person (your “agent”) to submit a California consumer rights request on your behalf. Authorized agents must submit the request via email to privacy@newsela.com and include a signed letter from the Newsela user confirming the agent has permission to submit the request on the user’s behalf. In certain circumstances, we may need to request additional information to verify the identity of the user about whom the request is being made and/or to verify that the user has provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request, and it may take additional time to fulfill agent-submitted requests. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we will direct future communications to the Newsela user on whose behalf the request was made. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.
4. RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active, authorized by your School, or for as long as is reasonably necessary to provide our Services. You can request your Personal Information to be deleted at any time by filling out our
Privacy Rights Request Webform
or emailing us at
privacy@newsela.com
.
