1. Introduction
Our mission at ev.energy is to deliver simpler, cheaper and greener electric vehicle charging for everyone. We do this by controlling your car or your charger to shift your charging to match lower cost and lower carbon energy within the constraints of the grid.
We need to collect some personal data from you, but we promise at all times to only capture the minimum amount of information required to offer our services and to help you. We will treat your personal data as if it were our own, keeping it safely and securely, never keeping it longer than is necessary and only sharing it with your knowledge, permission or if we are required to do so by law.
This policy outlines the details of how we use your information and also some small print which you need to know, and we are required to provide by law.
Just so you know, EV DOT ENERGY LTD is registered in England under company number 11468310, and its subsidiaries including EV.ENERGY CORP, are collectively known as ev.energy (or also just ‘us’, ‘we’, ‘our’). We are registered with the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) under registration number ZA464860.
This privacy policy applies to this website and the services offered by ev.energy be that via the ev.energy platform or the ev.energy app, which you can download in the  App Store and Google Play.
We also offer our services via other companies under their branding. This policy also explains how our partners may use your information. For ease of reference, we shall refer to any service we offer directly or via a partner as the “Service”.
2. Service and reason for processing your data
We provide software to electric vehicle owners (collectively known as “Users”) through an app, platform and website (the “Service” we provide). This Service offered by ev.energy intended for use as is.
The personal information that we collect enables ev.energy to:
Deliver and improve the Service;
Support you to use the Service;
Work with your energy company or DSO to deliver the Service; and
Provide enhanced services and rewards to you (in partnership with third-parties).
Before using the Service, ev.energy will ask for your consent before we process your data. We only collect the personal data required to enable us to deliver and support our Service to you.
A full list of the personal data we collect is in Section 3. There may be certain aspects of the ev.energy service, which we deliver in partnership with third-parties. We will only share personal data with third parties with your consent. We will always explain to you why we are sharing your personal data, our relationship with the third-party and how your data will be used. Please see Section 6 for a full list of the data we share.
3. Personal data we collect
To deliver our service, we may collect personal data, including but not limited to:
Identity and Contact Data
about you and how to contact you.
Profile and Consent Data
which comprises preferences (for marketing and other notifications), feedback and survey responses you have provided and partly anonymised analytical information about how you use our app.
Hardware Data
about your electric vehicle and charger so we know when to smart charge and can control charging.
Energy Data
such as your energy supplier, tariff and meter reference number so we can apply the right tariff and grid information to your supply, and so (with your consent) we can identify smart charging to third-parties.
Third-Party Account Data
which allows us to link your ev.energy account to your vehicle, charger or energy supplier accounts.
Technical Data
about the device you use to connect to our platform, your time zone and locale to enable us to tailor the user experience for your device and to ensure we support the devices you want to use to access the app and platform.
Transaction and Financial Data
about your energy usage and for any services you purchase through the platform
Tracking Data
which includes information we or others collect about you from cookies and similar tracking technologies such as web beacons, pixels and mobile identifiers.
For more detail on the specific data within any of these categories, please see
Appendix A
.
The information that we request will be used and retained by us and only shared with third parties where it is necessary to provide the service to you, and then only as described in this privacy policy. We do not use your data for any automated decision-making or profiling.
We may use, collect, and share aggregated data with third-parties. Aggregated Data may be derived from your data, but, as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity, it is not considered personal data in law. For example, we may aggregate your and other users’ Electric Vehicle Data to help utilities plan their charging networks.
4. Log data
Whenever you use our service, we collect some usage and log data. For example, in the case of an error in the app, we log information about the error to help us fix the error and stop it happening again in the future.
This Log Data may include the information listed under ‘Technical Data’ in
Section 3
and
Appendix A
, as well as the time and date of your use of the Service and configuration specific to your user account or profile.
5. Cookies
Cookies are one of the most widely used technologies on the internet and many essential website functions are dependent on their use. Cookies and other online tracking technologies are small pieces of data or code which contain user IDs that are automatically saved onto your computer or device when you visit a Website. These are used to identify your devices when you use and interact with our Website to personalise your experience. For example, they are often used to remember you are logged in, or to remember your preferences.
We use cookies and similar devices to facilitate your browsing on our website, understand how you interact with us and, in certain cases, to be able to show you advertisements in accordance with your browsing habits. You should now read our
Cookie Policy
. to understand this in more detail.
6. Providing your personal data to others
There are several reasons why we may share your data with other parties to enable us to deliver our Service to you.
6.1 Sharing your data to deliver and improve our Service
To provide our Service to you, ev.energy uses selected third parties to provide you with the service, and shall share some information with them, under strict confidentiality obligations, to provide you with the services.
Our service providers include:
Amazon Web Services, to enable us to run our cloud-based platform (
Privacy Policy
).
Freshdesk, to help provide customer support to you (
Privacy Policy
).
We may additionally ask for your permission to share your personal data with your electric vehicle manufacturer and/or your charger manufacturer, to enable us to deliver our Service to you, and obtain Electric Vehicle Data, Account Data and Transaction from your car or charger manufacturer.
For more information on our service providers, links to their policies and their location, please see
Appendix B
.
6.2 Sharing your data to support you as a customer
If you require support from ev.energy, ev.energy may share your personal data with suppliers and subcontractors to help resolve this issue. The data will include the nature of the query and any data supporting that, which may include Identity and Contact Data, Technical Data, Hardware Data as defined in
Section 3
.
We will only share the information where it is necessary to allow us to be able to provide those products and services to you.
6.3 Sharing your data to provide enhanced services and rewards
We may offer you enhanced services and rewards (e.g. smart charging rewards), which may be delivered in partnership with third-party providers.
For example, our smart charging rewards program is partially funded by energy networks and energy service companies to provide services to support the electricity grid whilst you charge your electric vehicle.
To confirm eligibility for these services, we may share Energy Data and Contact Data about you (specifically your postcode, the first line of your address, your meter identification number and your energy usage) with these third-party energy companies:
Electricity network companies, who deliver the electricity network in your local area;
Electricity market operators who help balance the grid on behalf of energy generators, network companies and consumers; and
Energy service providers who provide aggregation or access services to energy markets.
For more information on which companies we partner with and where they are based, please see
Appendix B
.
We may also share your email address and contact details to enable us to deliver an enhanced service and/or reward to you (e.g. send you a reward card from a well-known coffee chain).
If you change your mind, you can opt-out of any of our services or enhanced services at any time.  If you are unsure how to do this, please reach out to our customer support team.
Our US visitors and users should be aware that ev.energy is compliant with and understands its responsibilities under the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act).
6.4 Sharing your personal data with your energy company or DSO
We may work with your energy company or DSO to deliver our Service to you and may share your personal data with them, subject to the contractual relationship you have entered with them.
6.5 Sharing your data for legal reasons
Usually, we will only share personal information with your consent; however, we will share personal data where we have a legal obligation to do so; for example when directed by a court, or if requested with an appropriate warrant by law enforcement or tax agencies.
We may also share information without your permission where a person’s life is in danger and to instigate or defend a legal claim, for example, with a solicitor, our professional advisors, or a court.
6.6 Sharing your data for other reasons
We may share anonymised data with energy companies, DSOs and other Third Parties. The information transmitted is anonymised, which means no personal information about you is provided and location data is obfuscated to a larger area (such as a neighbourhood, or a position to within 100m to suitably ensure anonymity). Consequently, a third-party will not be able to identify you from any data shared directly from ev.energy.
On our site and in our app, with your consent, we may advise you of third-party goods or services which may interest you. If you give your permission, we may share your enquiry data with one or more selected third-party suppliers of goods and services identified, so that they can deal directly with you.
We may employ third-party companies and individuals to help us deliver and improve our Service to you.
We will take all reasonable precautions to ensure that any third party who processes your personal information on our behalf does so lawfully, commits to keeping your personal data both safe and secure, and will not share it with any other parties without our explicit permission. All third-parties will undergo a due-diligence assessment and a written agreement with specific terms around data security and privacy is in place.
7. Third-party websites and links to other sites
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We do not operate these external sites and we therefore strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
8. Retaining and deleting personal data
We will retain your data no longer than is required, as per data protection laws. We will keep data relating to your continued usage of our service and programmes for as long as you remain a customer and then for a period of time following cessation of use of the ev.energy service unless you exercise your ‘right to erasure’ and we have no overriding grounds to retain your personal data. Occasionally, there will be ad-hoc consideration to delete data we no longer require.
There may be circumstances in which we cannot delete some personal data where we have a legal requirement to retain it, such as participation in a Flexible Grid Services project. If you have any questions or want to know more about the data we are unable to delete, feel free to contact us using the details provided below.
Users can initiate account deletion, i.e. exercising their right to erasure, in our app by heading to ‘Settings’ -> ‘Account’ then pressing ‘Close my account’.
The longest ev.energy will retain your personally identifiable information is seven (7) years from the date you last used our Service to ensure compliance with legal obligations. Anonymized statistical data regarding the use of the app, services and charging activity will be kept indefinitely but will have no personal data associated with this information.
9. Security of personal data
We will take appropriate technical and organisational precautions to secure your personal data and to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal data.
The primary data store for all data in our platform is within the EU. To enable us to attract the best and most diverse talent, and deliver support around the clock, our employees are based worldwide. They can access the data which is stored in the EU but only under strict access controls. For a detailed list of our service providers, their privacy policies and where they are based, please see
Appendix B
.
We encrypt all data within our systems at rest. For services provided by third parties (such as those listed in
Appendix B
), we ensure that, at a minimum, confidential and financial data (such as passwords and cardholder data) are encrypted at rest, and access to all data are encrypted in transit.
Only secure access (such as HTTPS or WSS) is possible to the ev.energy platform. We send all information to the app securely, protected by encryption, to your device. Additionally, where data are accessed directly on our platform by third-parties, access to your data is secure, encrypted and logged.
We will take every precaution to protect your personal data once in our care; however, the transmission of unencrypted (or inadequately encrypted) data over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent by you or us over the internet. We value your trust in providing your personal data to us, and we will use all reasonable and commercially acceptable means to protect it. Still, unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable.
To help protect your account and personal information, you should ensure that your password is not susceptible to being guessed, whether by a person or a computer program. You are responsible for keeping the password you use for accessing our website confidential, and we will not ask you for your password (except when you log in to our platform). The ICO has some
great advice for protecting your information online
.
We won’t ask you to share sensitive information either, such as bank details, for the purpose of verifying your identity. If anyone purporting to be from ev.energy does ask for sensitive information, then please contact us using the details provided below.
10. Lawful bases of processing your information
ev.energy processes information on electric vehicle charging behaviour. We use this information to provide services to third-party energy, charging and automotive companies that enable those third-parties to monitor and control electric vehicle charging.
When you download our app, sign up to either our Service, or a Service that we deliver on behalf of one of our partners, ev.energy will ask for your explicit consent to capture, process and share your information. We will also ask for your permission to share your login details with third-party energy companies and energy information providers to verify which energy rate plan or tariff you are using.
You may hear about ev.energy from your electric vehicle charger installer or dealership, and they may provide your contact details to us after asking for your consent. We will rely on this consent provided to your installer or car dealer to tell you about our Services.
It may be necessary to share charging data, invoice details and other energy data with third parties, and we will process this data under our contractual obligations to either yourself or your energy company. We may share your data under our legal obligations or where a person’s life is in danger, as outlined in
Section 6.5
.
11. Your rights
You have the following rights concerning your personal data:
The right to be informed
– an obligation on us to tell you what we do with your personal data (which we do in our software and via this privacy policy) and we shall inform you if there is a serious breach of your personal data which would result in a high risk to your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You have the right to be made aware of any automated decision-making, made without any human involvement, or profiling of your personal information by ev.energy. Currently, we don’t use any automated decision-making.
The right of rectification
– an obligation in certain circumstances to correct your personal data if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
The right to erasure
– an obligation in certain circumstances to delete or remove your personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing (some jurisdictions also call this right ‘the right to be forgotten’). In some cases we are legally required to retain some personal data about you, for more information on exemptions on the right to erasure, see this information from [ICO:
https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/#ib6
]
The right to restrict processing
– an obligation in certain circumstances to stop actively processing your personal data.
The right to data portability
– an obligation in certain circumstances to allow you to transfer your personal data from us to a third party.
The right to object
– an obligation in certain circumstances to allow you to object to us processing your personal data where we do not have an overriding reason. You also have an absolute right to object to use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
The right of access
– a right to be told what personal data we hold about you and obtain a copy of that information.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

Datenschutzerklärung
Diese Datenschutzerklärung gilt für Kunden mit Wohnsitz in Deutschland. Wenn Sie nicht in Deutschland wohnen, lesen Sie bitte die
Datenschutzbestimmungen für den Rest der Welt.

This Privacy Policy applies to customers resident in Germany. If you do not reside in Germany, please see the
Privacy Policy for the Rest of the World
1. Einleitung
Unser Ziel bei ev.energy ist es, das Aufladen von Elektrofahrzeugen für jedermann einfacher, billiger und umweltfreundlicher zu gestalten. Wir tun dies, indem wir Ihr Fahrzeug oder Ihr Ladegerät so steuern, dass Ihr Ladevorgang auf kostengünstigere und kohlenstoffärmere Energie innerhalb der Grenzen des Stromnetzes abgestimmt ist.  Wir müssen einige personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen erheben, aber wir versprechen Ihnen, dass wir immer nur das Minimum an Informationen erfassen werden, das erforderlich ist, um unsere Dienste anzubieten und Ihnen zu helfen. Wir werden Ihre persönlichen Daten so behandeln, als wären es unsere eigenen. Das bedeutet, dass wir sie sicher aufbewahren, nie länger als nötig speichern und nur mit Ihrem Wissen, Ihrer Erlaubnis oder wenn wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind, weitergeben werden.  Diese Datenschutzerklärung beschreibt im Detail, wie wir Ihre Daten verwenden, und enthält auch das Kleingedruckte, das Sie wissen müssen und zu dem wir gesetzlich verpflichtet sind. Zu Ihrer Information: EV DOT ENERGY LTD ist in England unter der Firmennummer 11468310 registriert, und ihre Tochtergesellschaften, einschließlich EV.ENERGY CORP, sind gemeinsam als ev.energy bekannt (oder auch nur 'wir', 'wir', 'unser'). Wir sind beim UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) unter der Registrierungsnummer ZA464860 registriert.  Diese Datenschutzerklärung gilt für diese Webseite und die von ev.energy angebotenen Dienste, sei es über die ev.energy Plattform oder die ev.energy App, die Sie im iTunes App Store und bei Google Play herunterladen können.  Wir bieten unsere Dienste auch über andere Unternehmen unter deren Markennamen an. In dieser Datenschutzerklärung wird auch erläutert, wie unsere Partner Ihre Daten verwenden können. Der Einfachheit halber bezeichnen wir jeden Dienst, den wir direkt oder über einen Partner anbieten, als "Dienst".
2. Dienstleistung und Grund für die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten
Wir stellen Besitzern von Elektrofahrzeugen (kollektiv als "Nutzer" bezeichnet) über eine App, eine Plattform und eine Webseite Software zur Verfügung (der "Dienst", den wir anbieten). Dieser von ev.energy angebotene Dienst ist für die Nutzung im Ist-Zustand bestimmt.  Die persönlichen Daten, die wir sammeln, ermöglichen ev.energy, : Das Dienst bereitzustellen und zu verbessern; Sie bei der Nutzung des Dienstes zu unterstützen; Mit Ihrem Energieversorgungsunternehmen oder DSO zusammenzuarbeiten, um den Dienst bereitzustellen; und Ihnen (in Zusammenarbeit mit Dritten) verbesserte Dienste und Belohnungen anzubieten. Vor der Nutzung des Dienstes und Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten wird ev.energy Sie um Ihre Zustimmung bitten. Wir erheben nur die personenbezogenen Daten, die erforderlich sind, damit wir Ihnen unseren Dienst anbieten und Sie unterstützen können.   Eine vollständige Liste der personenbezogenen Daten, die wir erheben, finden Sie in Abschnitt 3. Bestimmte Aspekte des ev.energy-Dienstes können wir in Zusammenarbeit mit Dritten erbringen. Wir werden personenbezogene Daten nur mit Ihrer Zustimmung an Dritte weitergeben. Wir werden Ihnen immer erklären, warum wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten weitergeben, in welcher Beziehung wir zu dem Dritten stehen und wie Ihre Daten verwendet werden. In Abschnitt 6 finden Sie eine vollständige Liste der Daten, die wir weitergeben.
‍
‍
3. Personenbezogene Daten, die wir sammeln
‍
Um unsere Dienste zu erbringen, können wir personenbezogene Daten erheben, einschließlich, aber nicht beschränkt auf:
Identitäts- und Kontaktdaten
über Sie und wie wir Sie kontaktieren können.
Profil- und Zustimmungsdaten
, die Präferenzen (für Marketing und andere Benachrichtigungen), Feedback und Umfrageantworten, die Sie uns gegeben haben, sowie teilweise anonymisierte analytische Informationen darüber, wie Sie unsere App nutzen, umfassen.
Hardware-Daten
über Ihr Elektrofahrzeug und Ihr Ladegerät, damit wir wissen, wann wir intelligent laden und das Laden steuern können.
Energiedaten
wie z. B. Ihr Energieversorger, Ihr Tarif und Ihre Zählernummer, damit wir den richtigen Tarif und die richtigen Netzinformationen auf Ihre Versorgung anwenden können und damit wir (mit Ihrer Zustimmung) das Smart Charging für Dritte identifizieren können.
Kontodaten Dritter
, die es uns ermöglichen, Ihr ev.energy Konto mit Ihrem Fahrzeug, Ihrem Ladegerät oder Ihren Energieversorgerkonten zu verknüpfen.
Technische Daten
über das Gerät, das Sie für die Verbindung mit unserer Plattform verwenden, Ihre Zeitzone und Ihren Standort, damit wir das Benutzererlebnis auf Ihr Gerät abstimmen und sicherstellen können, dass wir die Geräte unterstützen, die Sie für den Zugriff auf die App und die Plattform verwenden möchten.
Transaktions- und Finanzdaten
über Ihren Energieverbrauch und für alle Dienste, die Sie über die Plattform erwerben.
Tracking-Daten
, die Informationen umfassen, die wir oder andere über Sie mit Hilfe von Cookies und ähnlichen Tracking-Technologien wie Web-Beacons, Pixeln und mobilen Identifikatoren sammeln.  Weitere Einzelheiten zu den spezifischen Daten innerhalb einer dieser Kategorien finden Sie in
Anhang A
.  Die von uns angeforderten Informationen werden von uns verwendet und aufbewahrt und nur dann an Dritte weitergegeben, wenn dies für die Erbringung der Dienstleistung für Sie erforderlich ist, und auch dann nur wie in dieser Datenschutzerklärung beschrieben. Wir verwenden Ihre Daten nicht für eine automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung oder Profilerstellung.  Wir können zusammengefasste Daten verwenden, sammeln und mit Dritten teilen. Aggregierte Daten können aus Ihren Daten abgeleitet werden, aber da diese Daten weder direkt noch indirekt Ihre Identität preisgeben, gelten sie rechtlich nicht als personenbezogene Daten. Beispielsweise können wir Ihre Daten und die Daten anderer Nutzer von Elektrofahrzeugen zusammenfassen, um Versorgungsunternehmen bei der Planung ihrer Ladenetze zu unterstützen.
4. Protokolldaten
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie unseren Dienst nutzen, erfassen wir einige Nutzungs- und Protokolldaten. Wenn beispielsweise ein Fehler in der App auftritt, protokollieren wir Informationen über den Fehler, damit wir den Fehler beheben und verhindern können, dass er in Zukunft erneut auftritt.  Diese Protokolldaten können die unter "Technische Daten" in
Abschnitt 3
und
Anhang A
aufgeführten Informationen sowie Zeit und Datum Ihrer Nutzung des Dienstes und die für Ihr Benutzerkonto oder Profil spezifische Konfiguration enthalten.
‍
5. Cookies
Cookies sind häufig verwendete kleine Dateien, die eine eindeutige anonyme Kennung enthalten. Cookies werden von der Webseite, die Sie besuchen, heruntergeladen und im internen Speicher Ihres Geräts gespeichert. Weitere Informationen darüber, welche Cookies wir verwenden und warum, und wie Sie Ihre Cookie-Einstellungen kontrollieren können, finden Sie in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie: https://ev.energy/cookies
‍
6. Weitergabe Ihrer persönlichen Daten an andere
Es gibt mehrere Gründe, warum wir Ihre Daten an andere Parteien weitergeben können, um Ihnen unseren Dienst zur Verfügung stellen zu können.
‍
‍
6.1 Weitergabe Ihrer Daten zur Bereitstellung und Verbesserung unseres Dienstes
‍
Um Ihnen unseren Dienst zur Verfügung zu stellen, bedient sich ev.energy ausgewählter Dritter, um Ihnen den Dienst zur Verfügung zu stellen, und wird einige Informationen mit ihnen unter strenger Vertraulichkeitsverpflichtung teilen, um Ihnen die Dienste zur Verfügung zu stellen.  Zu unseren Dienstleistern gehören: Amazon Web Services, damit wir unsere Cloud-basierte Plattform betreiben können (
Datenschutzerklärung
). Freshdesk, um Sie bei der Kundenbetreuung zu unterstützen (
Datenschutzerklärung
). Darüber hinaus können wir Sie um Ihre Erlaubnis bitten, Ihre persönlichen Daten an den Hersteller Ihres Elektrofahrzeugs und/oder Ihres Ladegeräts weiterzugeben, damit wir Ihnen unseren Dienst zur Verfügung stellen können und die Daten Ihres Elektrofahrzeugs, Ihre Kontodaten und Ihre Transaktionen von Ihrem Fahrzeug- oder Ladegerätehersteller erhalten.  Weitere Informationen zu unseren Dienstleistern, Links zu deren Richtlinien und deren Standort finden Sie in
Anhang B
.
‍
‍
6.2 Weitergabe Ihrer Daten, um Sie als Kunden zu unterstützen
‍
Wenn Sie Unterstützung von ev.energy benötigen, kann ev.energy Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Lieferanten und Unterauftragnehmer weitergeben, um Ihnen bei der Lösung des Problems zu helfen. Die Daten umfassen die Art der Anfrage und alle Daten, die diese unterstützen, einschließlich Identitäts- und Kontaktdaten, technische Daten und Hardware-Daten, wie in
Abschnitt 3
definiert.  Wir werden die Informationen nur weitergeben, wenn dies notwendig ist, um Ihnen diese Produkte und Dienste anbieten zu können.
‍
‍
6.3 Weitergabe Ihrer Daten zur Bereitstellung verbesserter Dienste und Belohnungen
‍
Wir können Ihnen erweiterte Dienste und Belohnungen anbieten (z. B. Smart Charging-Belohnungen), die in Zusammenarbeit mit Drittanbietern bereitgestellt werden können.  Unser Programm für Smart Charging-Belohnungen wird zum Beispiel teilweise von Energienetzen und Energiedienstleistern finanziert, um Dienste zur Unterstützung des Stromnetzes zu erbringen, während Sie Ihr Elektrofahrzeug aufladen.  Um die Berechtigung für diese Dienste zu bestätigen, können wir Energiedaten und Kontaktdaten über Sie (insbesondere Ihre Postleitzahl, die erste Zeile Ihrer Adresse, Ihre Zähler-Identifikationsnummer und Ihren Energieverbrauch) an diese dritten Energieunternehmen weitergeben: Stromnetzbetreiber, die das Stromnetz in Ihrer Region betreiben; Strommarktbetreiber, die im Auftrag von Energieerzeugern, Netzbetreibern und Verbrauchern zum Ausgleich des Netzes beitragen, und Energiedienstleister, die Aggregations- oder Zugangsdienste zu den Energiemärkten anbieten. Weitere Informationen darüber, mit welchen Unternehmen wir zusammenarbeiten und wo sie ihren Sitz haben, finden Sie in
Anhang B
.  Wir können auch Ihre E-Mail-Adresse und Ihre Kontaktdaten weitergeben, um Ihnen einen verbesserten Dienst und/oder eine Prämie zukommen zu lassen (z. B. um Ihnen einen Gutschein einer bekannten Kaffeekette zu schicken).  Sie können sich jederzeit von diesen erweiterten Diensten abmelden.
‍
6.4 Weitergabe Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten an Ihr Energieversorgungsunternehmen oder Ihren VNB
Wir können mit Ihrem Energieversorgungsunternehmen oder Netzbetreiber zusammenarbeiten, um Ihnen unseren Dienst zu bieten, und Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an diese weitergeben, sofern dies vertraglich mit Ihnen vereinbart wurde.
‍
6.5 Weitergabe Ihrer Daten aus rechtlichen Gründen
In der Regel geben wir personenbezogene Daten nur mit Ihrer Zustimmung weiter; wir geben personenbezogene Daten jedoch weiter, wenn wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind, z. B. auf Anweisung eines Gerichts oder wenn wir von Strafverfolgungs- oder Steuerbehörden mit einer entsprechenden Vollmacht dazu aufgefordert werden.  Wir können auch ohne Ihre Zustimmung Informationen weitergeben, wenn das Leben einer Person in Gefahr ist und um einen Rechtsanspruch einzuleiten oder zu verteidigen, z. B. mit einem Anwalt, unseren professionellen Beratern oder einem Gericht.
‍
6.6 Weitergabe Ihrer Daten aus anderen Gründen
Wir können anonymisierte Daten an Energieunternehmen, Verteilernetzbetreiber und andere Dritte weitergeben. Die übermittelten Informationen sind anonymisiert, d. h. es werden keine persönlichen Informationen über Sie übermittelt, und die Standortdaten werden auf einen größeren Bereich (z. B. eine Nachbarschaft oder eine Position im Umkreis von 100 m, um die Anonymität zu gewährleisten) eingeschränkt. Folglich ist ein Dritter nicht in der Lage, Sie anhand der direkt von ev.energy übermittelten Daten zu identifizieren.  Auf unserer Webseite und in unserer App können wir Sie mit Ihrer Zustimmung auf Waren oder Dienste Dritter hinweisen, die Sie interessieren könnten. Wenn Sie Ihre Zustimmung erteilen, können wir Ihre Anfragedaten an einen oder mehrere ausgewählte Drittanbieter von identifizierten Waren und Dienste weitergeben, damit diese direkt mit Ihnen in Kontakt treten können.  Wir können Drittunternehmen und Einzelpersonen beauftragen, uns bei der Erbringung und Verbesserung unserer Dienste für Sie zu unterstützen.  Wir werden alle angemessenen Vorkehrungen treffen, um sicherzustellen, dass Dritte, die Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in unserem Auftrag verarbeiten, dies rechtmäßig tun, sich verpflichten, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten sicher aufzubewahren, und sie nicht ohne unsere ausdrückliche Zustimmung an Dritte weitergeben. Alle Drittparteien werden einer Due-Diligence-Prüfung unterzogen, und es wird eine schriftliche Vereinbarung mit spezifischen Bestimmungen zur Datensicherheit und zum Datenschutz geschlossen.
7. Websites von Dritten und Links zu anderen Websites
Dieser Dienst kann Links zu anderen Websites enthalten. Wenn Sie auf einen Link eines Dritten klicken, werden Sie zu dieser Webseite weitergeleitet. Wir betreiben diese externen Websites nicht und empfehlen Ihnen daher dringend, die Datenschutzerklärung dieser Websites zu lesen. Wir haben keine Kontrolle über und übernehmen keine Verantwortung für den Inhalt, die Datenschutzrichtlinien oder die Praktiken von Websites oder Diensten Dritter.
‍
8. Aufbewahrung und Löschung von personenbezogenen Daten
Wir werden Ihre Daten nicht länger aufbewahren, als dies gemäß den Datenschutzgesetzen erforderlich ist. Wir bewahren Daten, die sich auf Ihre fortgesetzte Nutzung unseres Dienstes und unserer Programme beziehen, so lange auf, wie Sie Kunde bleiben, und dann für einen Zeitraum nach Beendigung der Nutzung des ev.energy-Dienstes, es sei denn, Sie machen von Ihrem "Recht auf Löschung" Gebrauch und wir haben keine zwingenden Gründe, Ihre persönlichen Daten aufzubewahren. Gelegentlich werden wir ad hoc erwägen, Daten zu löschen, die wir nicht mehr benötigen. Unter Umständen können wir bestimmte personenbezogene Daten nicht löschen, wenn wir gesetzlich verpflichtet sind, sie aufzubewahren, z. B. bei der Teilnahme an einem Flexible Grid Services-Projekt. Wenn Sie Fragen haben oder mehr über die Daten wissen möchten, die wir nicht löschen können, können Sie uns unter den unten angegebenen Kontaktdaten-erreichen.  Nutzer können die Kontolöschung, d.h. die Ausübung ihres Rechts auf Löschung, in unserer App veranlassen, indem sie zu "Einstellungen" -> "Konto" gehen und dann auf "Mein Konto schließen“ („Close my account“) klicken.  Die längste Zeit, die ev.energy Ihre personenbezogenen Daten aufbewahrt, beträgt sieben (7) Jahre ab dem Datum, an dem Sie unseren Dienst zuletzt genutzt haben, um sicherzustellen, dass anonymisierte statistische Daten über die Nutzung der App, der Dienste und der Ladevorgänge werden auf unbestimmte Zeit aufbewahrt, wobei jedoch keine personenbezogenen Daten mit diesen Informationen verbunden sind.
‍
9. Sicherheit der personenbezogenen Daten
Wir treffen angemessene technische und organisatorische Vorkehrungen, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen und den Verlust, den Missbrauch oder die Veränderung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verhindern.  Der primäre Datenspeicher für alle Daten auf unserer Plattform befindet sich innerhalb der EU. Damit wir die besten und vielfältigsten Talente gewinnen und rund um die Uhr Unterstützung bieten können, sind unsere Mitarbeiter weltweit tätig. Sie können auf die in der EU gespeicherten Daten zugreifen, allerdings nur unter strengen Zugangskontrollen. Eine detaillierte Liste unserer Dienstleister, ihrer Datenschutzrichtlinien und ihres Sitzes finden Sie in
Anhang B
.  Wir verschlüsseln alle Daten innerhalb unserer Systeme im Ruhezustand. Für Dienste, die von Dritten erbracht werden (wie die in
Anhang B
aufgeführten), stellen wir sicher, dass zumindest vertrauliche und finanzielle Daten (wie Passwörter und Karteninhaberdaten) im Ruhezustand verschlüsselt werden und der Zugriff auf alle Daten während der Übertragung verschlüsselt wird.  Es ist nur ein sicherer Zugang (wie HTTPS oder WSS) zur ev.energy Plattform möglich. Wir senden alle Informationen zur App sicher und durch Verschlüsselung geschützt an Ihr Gerät. Wenn Dritte direkt auf unserer Plattform auf Daten zugreifen, ist der Zugriff auf Ihre Daten ebenfalls sicher, verschlüsselt und protokolliert.  Wir treffen alle Vorkehrungen, um Ihre persönlichen Daten zu schützen, sobald sie in unserer Obhut sind; die Übertragung unverschlüsselter (oder unzureichend verschlüsselter) Daten über das Internet ist jedoch von Natur aus unsicher, und wir können die Sicherheit der von Ihnen oder uns über das Internet gesendeten Daten nicht garantieren. Wir schätzen Ihr Vertrauen, wenn Sie uns Ihre persönlichen Daten zur Verfügung stellen, und wir werden alle angemessenen und kommerziell akzeptablen Mittel einsetzen, um sie zu schützen. Dennoch ist leider keine Methode der Übertragung über das Internet oder der elektronischen Speicherung 100% sicher und zuverlässig.  Um Ihr Konto und Ihre persönlichen Daten zu schützen, sollten Sie sicherstellen, dass Ihr Passwort nicht erraten werden kann, weder von einer Person noch von einem Computerprogramm. Sie sind dafür verantwortlich, das Passwort, das Sie für den Zugang zu unserer Webseite verwenden, vertraulich zu behandeln, und wir werden Sie nicht nach Ihrem Passwort (außer wenn Sie sich bei unserer Plattform anmelden) fragen. Die ICO hat einige gute
Ratschläge zum Schutz Ihrer Daten im Internet.
Wir werden Sie auch nicht bitten, sensible Informationen, wie z. B. Ihre Bankverbindung, zur Überprüfung Ihrer Identität anzugeben. Sollte jemand, der sich als Mitarbeiter von ev.energy ausgibt, nach sensiblen Daten fragen, setzen Sie sich bitte mit uns in Verbindung unter den unten angegebenen Kontaktdaten.
‍
10. Rechtmäßige Grundlagen der Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten
ev.energy verarbeitet Informationen über das Ladeverhalten von Elektrofahrzeugen. Wir verwenden diese Informationen, um Drittanbietern von Energie-, Lade- und Automobilunternehmen Dienste zur Verfügung zu stellen, die es diesen Drittanbietern ermöglichen, das Laden von Elektrofahrzeugen zu überwachen und zu steuern.  Wenn Sie unsere App herunterladen, sich für unseren Dienst oder einen Dienst, den wir im Namen eines unserer Partner anbieten, anmelden, wird ev.energy Sie um Ihre ausdrückliche Zustimmung zur Erfassung, Verarbeitung und Weitergabe Ihrer Daten bitten. Wir werden Sie auch um Ihre Erlaubnis bitten, Ihre Anmeldedaten an dritte Energieunternehmen und Energieinformationsanbieter weiterzugeben, um zu überprüfen, welchen Energietarif Sie nutzen.  Es kann sein, dass Sie von Ihrem Installateur oder Händler für Elektrofahrzeug-Ladegeräte von ev.energy erfahren, und dass diese Ihre Kontaktdaten an uns weitergeben, nachdem sie Sie um Ihre Zustimmung gebeten haben. Wir werden uns auf diese Zustimmung Ihres Installateurs oder Autohändlers verlassen, um Sie über unsere Dienste zu informieren.  Es kann notwendig sein, Ladedaten, Rechnungsdaten und andere Energiedaten an Dritte weiterzugeben, und wir werden diese Daten im Rahmen unserer vertraglichen Verpflichtungen gegenüber Ihnen oder Ihrem Energieversorger verarbeiten. Wir können Ihre Daten im Rahmen unserer gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen weitergeben oder wenn das Leben einer Person in Gefahr ist, wie in
Abschnitt 6.5
beschrieben.
11. Ihre Rechte
Sie haben die folgenden Rechte in Bezug auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten:
Das Recht, informiert zu werden
- eine Verpflichtung für uns, Ihnen mitzuteilen, was wir mit Ihren personenbezogenen Daten machen (was wir in unserer Software und über diese Datenschutzerklärung tun), und wir werden Sie informieren, wenn es eine schwerwiegende Verletzung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten gibt, die ein hohes Risiko für Ihre grundlegenden Rechten und Freiheiten zur Folge hätte. Sie haben das Recht, über eine automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung, die ohne menschliche Beteiligung erfolgt, oder über ein Profiling Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch ev.energy informiert zu werden. Derzeit verwenden wir keine automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung.
Das Recht auf Berichtigung
- eine Verpflichtung unter bestimmten Umständen, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu berichtigen, wenn sie unrichtig oder unvollständig sind.
Das Recht auf Löschung
- eine Verpflichtung unter bestimmten Umständen, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu löschen oder zu entfernen, wenn es keinen zwingenden Grund für ihre weitere Verarbeitung gibt (in einigen Rechtsordnungen wird dieses Recht auch als "Recht auf Vergessenwerden" bezeichnet). In einigen Fällen sind wir gesetzlich verpflichtet, einige personenbezogene Daten über Sie aufzubewahren. Weitere Informationen über Ausnahmen vom Recht auf Löschung finden Sie in dieser Information von [ICO:
https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/#ib6
]
Das Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung
- eine Verpflichtung, unter bestimmten Umständen die aktive Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten einzustellen.
Das Recht auf Datenübertragbarkeit
- eine Verpflichtung, Ihnen unter bestimmten Umständen zu ermöglichen, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten von uns an einen Dritten zu übertragen.
Das Recht auf Widerspruch
- eine Verpflichtung, Ihnen unter bestimmten Umständen zu gestatten, gegen die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten Widerspruch einzulegen, wenn wir keinen zwingenden Grund haben. Sie haben außerdem ein absolutes Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten für Direktmarketingzwecke.  Soweit die Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch uns eine Einwilligung ist, haben Sie das Recht, diese Einwilligung jederzeit zu widerrufen.

We use your personal information to recommend AWS Offerings that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with AWS Offerings.
Comply with Legal Obligations:
In certain cases, we have a legal obligation to collect, use, or retain your personal information. For example, we collect bank account information from AWS Marketplace sellers for identity verification.

How We Share Personal Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions Involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the AWS Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.
Third-Party Service Providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Us and Others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of AWS, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.
At Your Option:
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
Location of Personal Information
Amazon Web Services, Inc. is located in the United States, and our affiliated companies are located throughout the world. Depending on the scope of your interactions with AWS Offerings, your personal information may be stored in or accessed from multiple countries, including the United States. Whenever we transfer personal information to other jurisdictions, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.

We maintain a wide variety of compliance programs that validate our security controls. Click
here

We protect the security of your information during transmission to or from AWS websites, applications, products, or services by using encryption protocols and software.

for a list of examples of information that you can access. If you cannot access or update your information yourself, you can always contact us for assistance.

AWS Management Console

11. OTHER COMMUNICATIONS
If you are our Customer, we will send you announcements (email or in product notifications related to the Services) on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an e-mail. Generally, you may not opt-out of such communications as they are a key part of delivering our Services to you effectively. If you do not wish to receive them, you may deactivate your Account.
12. RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA
We will retain Personal Data only as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is collected, as set out in this Notice.

If any Personal Data is only useful for a short period (e.g., for a specific activity, promotion or marketing campaign), we will not retain it for longer than the period for which it is used by us. If you have opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we will need to retain certain Personal Data on a suppression list indefinitely so that we know not to send you further marketing communications in the future. However, we will not use this Personal Data to send you further marketing unless you subsequently opt back in to receive such marketing.
Should you apply to work for us, we will retain data from your application for a limited period for record keeping and legal purposes. We may (subject to the laws in your jurisdiction) also retain your data in order to contact you if a role arises for which we think you would be suitable. Further information about this will be provided during the application process and we will ask for consent where necessary according to local law.
The above examples may vary in some cases due to local laws, liability periods and mandatory retention requirements. For example, if certain information needs to be retained for longer according to local laws, regulations or because different legal limitation periods apply, then we will keep the Personal Data for these longer periods.
