Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you create a Garmin account, interact with our customer support specialists, and visit
Garmin.com
or other Garmin websites and apps covered by this privacy policy.
What personal data does Garmin collect?
Garmin makes products that are engineered on the inside for life on the outside. We ask for personal data — such as your name, email address, location, and other information — so you can sign in to your account, receive personalized support, receive important safety information about your devices, and get the most out of our products.

When You Make a Garmin Account
Garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in. It also helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
When You Sync Devices
When you sync devices, data such as your IP address, sync time and date, and battery level will be uploaded to Garmin.
When You Buy Products or Subscriptions
When you buy products or subscriptions through our website, stores, or apps, we ask for information such as your name, address, phone number, and other information needed to collect your payment and fulfill your order. We have a third party process your payment information, but Garmin does not store your payment card details.
When You Use Location Features
Sometimes we need to collect your device’s location. That makes it a lot easier to tell you about things such as weather in your area, nearby traffic, and even movie prices near you.
When You Use Auto Navigation
With your consent, Garmin collects information that includes location, direction, and speed to help with features such as parking and traffic.
When You Contact Garmin
We know you might want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact, device, or subscription information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.

To Keep You Informed
When we have something important to tell you about your products, apps, subscriptions, or account — such as vital safety information, app updates, new products or deals, and updates to our privacy policy — we use collected contact information to reach you.
To Improve Our Sites and Apps
When you visit our sites or use our apps, we collect information — such as your IP address, location, times that you visit, and more — to let us know how people navigate our sites and apps and how we can improve them.
To Give You Information You Might Actually Find Interesting
We use things such as cookies, pixel tags, and similar tools to help us provide better, more relevant content on our sites.
We also use these tools to see how effective our ads are and to identify any problems that we need to fix. All in all, we just want to give you websites worth browsing.
