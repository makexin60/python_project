If you want to exercise a right specific to the use of certain BRP websites or mobile applications, you can do so by following the procedure listed in the terms and conditions of the website or mobile application you are using.
Please note that applicable laws may restrict or limit your rights, which means that in some situations as permitted by applicable laws, we are entitled to deny your request. In any case we will explain to you the reason why we cannot fulfill your request as permitted by law.
Only you or an authorized representative may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may be required to submit proof of your identity to make a privacy right request and we may not be able to comply with your request if we are unable to confirm your identity or to connect the information you submit in your request with personal information in our possession.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Complaint Resolution
We are committed to working with you to resolve any concern you may have about our use of your personal information or to obtain a fair resolution to any complaint. If, however, you believe that we have not been able to assist with your complaint or concern, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your country or supervisory authority.
