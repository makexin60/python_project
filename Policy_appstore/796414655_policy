What does Remi-Online.ro do to protect data?
We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security procedures to safeguard the data we process from loss, misuse, and alteration and to help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security and to ensure that we correctly use the data we hold in accordance with the purposes for which we collected that data.
We use industry-standard practices such as encryption, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of any personal information that we might collect from you. We also strive to limit access to your data to employees performing a legitimate business function which requires them to access and use your data in order to supply you with our Services. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods to ensure we continue to protect your data.
Whilst we will do our best to protect your data, the transmission of information by you to us over the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of data during its transfer over the Internet to us. Any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use the procedures and security features outlined in this section to try to prevent any unauthorised access.
How long does Remi-Online.ro keep hold of data?
We will keep data only for as long as it is relevant and useful for the purpose for which it was originally collected and otherwise where required by law. This means that we will only retain your data for the minimum reasonable time period to allow us to provide our Services to you. If you decide to delete an account you have with us, certain data does stay on our Remi-Online.ro system for administrative purposes and to defend or bring any legal action. Please email us at admin@remi-online.ro for information regarding retention periods.

You may create a profile for certain Services which may be visible to other users. Other users can choose to add you as a friend. You can change your settings through the 'my profile' function in our Services at any time.
We or our third-party partners may disclose your personal data where we are required or permitted to do so by law or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party. We may also share your data with third parties to prevent fraud, abusive or unlawful behaviour or to demonstrate our compliance with other terms or laws.
Remi-Online.ro may disclose your information to third parties in connection with a purchase, transfer or sale of Remi-Online.ro.

our main website www.remi-online.ro or through our mobile applications ("apps") and any games, products, forums and services we offer through the apps or website (all collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as our "Services").
This Privacy Policy governs the collection, storage and use of personal information by us via our websites, apps and Services. It provides you with details about the personal information we collect from you, how we use your personal information, and your rights regarding the personal information we hold about you. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

Please note that the Services may contain links to websites or other services owned and operated by third parties. We do not endorse any such third-party services. We are not responsible or liable for anything that happens to you when you visit or use these services. Remi-Online.ro strongly recommends that you review the privacy policies and cookie usage of these third parties.
What data does Remi-Online.ro collect from you?
In this Privacy Policy, "data" means any personal data about you which could identify you (by itself or in combination with other data) such as your email address or an online identifier.
We collect data about you in a number of different ways. In this section, we explain the different ways we collect personal data about you and the ways in which that information will be used. For more detail on how we use your data, please see the section titled " What does Remi-Online.ro do with this data?"

You can manage the data which is shared by such third parties with us by amending your preferences using the privacy settings which these third parties provide on their platforms.
We will sometimes use third party advertising companies to help us collect this data. Further information is provided below in the section titled "Third party advertising companies".
What does Remi-Online.ro do with this data and what is our legal basis for processing this data?
Use of data which is necessary to perform a contract
We collect, store and use certain data as it is necessary in order for us to provide you with access to our Services under the relevant terms and conditions of those Services. This includes:
providing you with a consistent and personalised Service across different devices and platforms and parts of our Services, for example, ensuring that your progress is saved across devices and displaying your image to other users;
to restrict customers from attempting to use our Services from a restricted territory or who are under-age and attempting to access inappropriate content in breach of our terms and conditions;
to ensure that you are complying with our terms and conditions when you use our Services and taking any necessary action if you are not complying with our terms and conditions;
to moderate any chat messages in chat forums, in order to restrict access to harmful, infringing or illegal content;
to process any refunds requested by you.
This applies to the following data:
your username and password in order to allow you to log-in to your account for any of our Services from any device;
your contact details so that we can contact you with material variations to the legal terms relating to the Services you have asked us to supply (in accordance with our terms and conditions);
your contact details to communicate with you in relation to any competition that you have entered through our Services (in accordance with the relevant competition terms and conditions);
your contact details along with details of your device operating system, browser version and IP address, in order to offer you technical support or respond to service questions that you raise.
Use of data which is necessary for our legitimate interests
Sometimes, our use of your data is for purposes which are ancillary to the provision of the Services, or which are desirable in order to make them operate more effectively. In those circumstances, we believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your data, and do not believe that this storage and use of your data will be of particular concern to you.
We use your data for our legitimate interests in the following ways:
to detect and prevent fraud, hacking and/or cheating;
to keep our Services secure;
to provide you with any newsletter or blog that you subscribe to with us (which you can opt out of at any time using the privacy settings on our apps or through your profile settings on our websites);
to customise the Services which are available to you;
to improve the Services, for analysis and reporting purposes (this also includes using data to log any crashes in our provision of the Services, so we may report such interruptions (in this regard, we may use a third party to assist us));
to track your use of our Services across our different games and platforms in order to provide you with a seamless experience;
to connect social media accounts which you have actively linked with our Services (such as Facebook or Google+);
to understand your preferences and personalise your experience of our Services;
to send you push notifications with service-related information for certain Services (which you can choose not to accept or turn off by visiting the settings section of your device and selecting the appropriate setting);
to communicate to you details of our events or promotions that you may be interested in within a game;
to help us manage and provide you with advertising, as further described in the 'Third Party Advertising' section below;
to record your preferences in relation to advertising and marketing communications;
to provide you with any customer support you have requested.
Data we use with your consent
We collect, store and use your email address, if you have provided your consent, in order to send to you promotional offers and provide marketing for Services that we believe may be of interest to you (see below for details of our marketing communications). We also use your data to offer you other Services which we think may be of interest to you by email where you have given your consent.
Some of the third party advertising companies that we work with also collect, use and store data about you with your consent when you access and use our Services in order to provide you with targeted advertising. For more details on our relationship with third party advertising companies and how you can manage your consents please see the section below titled 'Third party advertising companies'.
You can withdraw your consent at any point using the privacy settings available on our apps, and in your profile settings available on our websites, which means you will no longer receive these marketing messages.
Anonymous data
We will also collect anonymised details about visitors to and use of our Services for the purposes of creating aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details we collect for these purposes.
Does Remi-Online.ro send marketing communications and how can I opt out?
If you have provided your consent, we may send you marketing communications in relation to our other Services that we think may be of interest to you via email. These messages will only ever be in relation to the named other similar Services of Remi-Online.ro that you have provided your consent to receive. We do not provide your data to third parties so that they can send you direct marketing communications via email or push notification without first obtaining your consent. Please also see the section below regarding third party advertising for more information about advertising activities on our Services involving third parties.
You can opt-out of receiving any direct marketing communications that we (or any third party to whom we have disclosed your personal information with your consent) may send you by using the unsubscribe mechanism in those marketing emails, or, in relation to push notifications, by choosing not to accept them or by turning them off by visiting the settings on your device and selecting the appropriate setting.
What does Remi-Online.ro do to protect data?
We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security procedures to safeguard the data we process from loss, misuse, and alteration and to help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security and to ensure that we correctly use the data we hold in accordance with the purposes for which we collected that data.
We use industry-standard practices such as encryption, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of any personal information that we might collect from you. We also strive to limit access to your data to employees performing a legitimate business function which requires them to access and use your data in order to supply you with our Services. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods to ensure we continue to protect your data.
Whilst we will do our best to protect your data, the transmission of information by you to us over the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of data during its transfer over the Internet to us. Any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use the procedures and security features outlined in this section to try to prevent any unauthorised access.
How long does Remi-Online.ro keep hold of data?
We will keep data only for as long as it is relevant and useful for the purpose for which it was originally collected and otherwise where required by law. This means that we will only retain your data for the minimum reasonable time period to allow us to provide our Services to you. If you decide to delete an account you have with us, certain data does stay on our Remi-Online.ro system for administrative purposes and to defend or bring any legal action. Please email us at admin@remi-online.ro for information regarding retention periods.
What data is shared with or accessed by third parties?
Remi-Online.ro will share your data with various third parties as follows:
We share your data with our third party payment providers where you have specifically asked us to complete any in-app or in-game purchases. These third-party payment providers may also ask us to share your data with them to confirm the nature of any payment transaction and to verify your identity and payment details.
You may create a profile for certain Services which may be visible to other users. Other users can choose to add you as a friend. You can change your settings through the 'my profile' function in our Services at any time.
We or our third-party partners may disclose your personal data where we are required or permitted to do so by law or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party. We may also share your data with third parties to prevent fraud, abusive or unlawful behaviour or to demonstrate our compliance with other terms or laws.
Remi-Online.ro may disclose your information to third parties in connection with a purchase, transfer or sale of Remi-Online.ro.
If you choose to access any Services through a third party platform such as Facebook or Google, then that third party may collect other information about you (including about your use of the Services) in accordance with its terms and own privacy policy and sometimes they share some data with us. They have their own privacy settings which you can access on that third party platform in order to change your preferences.
We require any third parties processing your data on our behalf to process it in accordance with your rights, our instructions and applicable law.
Third party advertising companies
We want to make sure that our advertising and marketing is relevant and interesting to you and our other customers.
To achieve this, we use third-party advertising and technology companies to serve ads and/or provide aggregated data to assist in serving ads when you visit or use our Services. This includes third party technology companies which collect data about you in order to build a profile of your preferences based on your activities when you visit or use our Services. We also use these companies to automatically collect data from you when you use our Services in order to help us identify the ads that are served to you and what you do after seeing those ads. In addition, we share data with providers of web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, which we use to analyse your use of the Services. A list of the third party advertising and technology companies that we use, and links to their privacy information, is available at the end of this page.
These third party advertising companies collect, store and use data by integrating cookies, tracking code and other software in our Services. The relevant data collected by these third parties includes a unique device ID, geo-location details and your assigned Remi-Online.ro user ID. Data which you provide to Remi-Online.ro when using our Services may also be captured by these third parties. The data collected by these third parties will vary, but may include your location, advertising ID, IP address, information on your interaction with advertising, browsing history and other technical information.
These third party advertising companies will collect and use your data to provide you with more targeted advertising that is relevant to you and your preferences with your consent. You can control and withdraw your consent at any time by visiting the game settings page or your profile page available on our Services. If you do not provide or withdraw your consent to receive targeted advertising that is relevant to you and your preferences, or if we know you are under the age of 14, then we will still serve you advertising when you visit or use our Services but this will no longer be tailored to you or your preferences.
In some cases these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.
Please see our
Cookies Policy
for more information on the third party advertising companies which collect, use and store data about you, and the use of cookies and other tracking technologies on our Services.
You can choose what data we share with our advertising parteners at

Ogury Advertising Privacy Policy.
Hi,
This privacy policy set out:
What data we collect and from which sources
;
Our commitments regarding your data
;
How your data is (or is not) used by Ogury
;
How your data may be shared with third parties
;
the rights and choices you have over your data
if you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland
or
in a regulated U.S. State
, so that you can easily exercise them.
When we say “Ogury,” “we,” or “us” in this privacy policy, we mean Ogury Limited (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) that acts as the controller of your data. A controller is the entity which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
This notice does not cover how our partners may use your data or when we use your data on behalf of our clients as a processor (or service provider), which is explained in their own privacy policies. When you visit our corporate website
https://ogury.com/
our
Website Privacy Policy
applies.
We’ve tried to make this as easy to read as possible. Please sit back, relax and enjoy the reading. If anything is unclear, please contact us at
dpo@ogury.co
so we can assist.
Our activities
We provide digital advertising services that allow:
publishers to monetize their content by making ad space available on their digital properties available for purchase;
and brands to purchase the opportunity to show ads on digital properties visited by an audience that may be interested in their products or services.
We also offer advertising-related services to publishers and brands, including measuring and reporting on advertising performance, preventing fraud, resolving errors, and other services aimed at making the buying and selling of advertising placements seamless, efficient, and effective.
How do we do it?
Let’s begin with the foundational principle of our privacy-centric services:
we don’t know (and don’t need to know) who you are
. We don’t know your name, your postal address, your phone number, your email address, your exact location or any other information that would allow us to directly and indirectly reveal your identity.
Instead, when you visit a digital property using our services – such as your favourite gaming app – we use cookies and non-cookie technologies to distinguish your browser or app from others and assign to it a limited amount of data to serve ads that may be of interest to you.
We decide what ad you see based on our recommendation algorithms that can operate in three ways:
Contextual-based targeting
– By relying solely on our own understanding of the key audience details of a particular ad space on a given digital property, built from multiple data points and criteria, such as:
contextual information about the ad space, including characteristics of the ad space (e.g., format, size, visibility), the semantic context surrounding the ad space, the date and time of your visit, and the city where you are located;
the responses you voluntarily submit to us when completing surveys that we present in place or after advertisements on the digital property;
and aggregated data obtained from third parties (e.g., official reports and market figures).
Identifier-based targeting
– By relying on identifiers provided by brands to define specific audiences to target.
Hybrid
– By relying on identifiers provided by brands, while extending the delivery to other ad spaces that contextually match.

Legal basis for processing your personal data
Our legal basis for collecting and using your data, as outlined in this privacy policy, is

Your rights
Our partners
CCPA Privacy Policy
Welcome! This is where you can learn about Criteo, the technologies and services we offer to our partners, and our data collection and privacy policies.
Disable Criteo services
Our activity
Criteo helps brands, e-commerce sites and other advertisers (“Advertisers”) promote their products and services. We do that by enabling Advertisers to tailor their campaigns and/or offers to audiences that they want to reach with content that they wish to promote, which in turns means that you may receive advertising that may be of interest to you on the websites, mobile applications and other platforms of our partners (the “Publishers” or “Partners”).
How do our services work?
Criteo does not use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc.
When you browse an Advertiser’s website or mobile application that uses our technologies, that technology allows us to collect a limited amount of data relating to your browsing, such as the products you have viewed, put in your shopping cart and purchased.
Find out more about the type of data collected by Criteo
. This navigation data is linked to a unique identifier, namely an identification cookie or any other similar technology (such as mobile advertising identifiers and non-cookie technologies) depending on your navigation environment.
When you browse a Publisher’s website or mobile application that also uses our technologies, the Publisher notifies us, either directly or through an advertiser exchange, that an advertising space is available to offer you personalized advertising. The Criteo technology, working with our Advertisers, then may decide to purchase that advertising space.
The advertising you see from our partners when using our technology is based on our recommendation algorithms.
Practical example
Here is one way our technology allows us to provide you with ads that may be of interest to you:
When users visit an Advertiser website using our technologies, data relating to their browsing events are collected.
Example of data collected by Criteo:
The user with the cookie identifier 123f94d8-a745-4f8b-a1d0-bf6fbbd60058 (let’s name it “Criteo ID 123” for convenience) viewed product A on 01/01/2018 at 13:37 while browsing www.example-advertiser.com.
Our technologies compare these data with the aggregated data available on the Advertiser’s website.
Example of aggregated data available:
In general, users who purchased Product A on www.example-advertiser.com also purchased Product B on this website
In general, Product C is popular on this website
When users browse a Publisher website, we are informed of the availability of advertising spaces.
Example of data collected by Criteo:
An advertising space with the following characteristics (size, visibility, etc.) is available on www.example-publisher.com that the Criteo ID 123 is about to browse
Then our algorithms determine the relevance for buying the advertising space and displaying a personalized ad on it.
Example of decision that would be taken by Criteo: Buy the advertising space available on www.example-publisher.com and display an ad featuring the following products:
Product A, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 showed interest in it during a recent session
Product B, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 is likely to be interested in this product since he/she has viewed product A during a recent session
Product C, because this product is popular.
If you disable Criteo services, we will not display any personalized ads to you. On the other hand, the advertising space may be purchased by another company to display personalized or non-personalized ads. If you want to disable Criteo services,

.
Please note that the use of our technologies on our partners’ websites and mobile applications is governed by their privacy policies, which can be accessed directly from their websites and/or mobile applications. We require them to provide you with complete and appropriate information and, to the extent required by law, to obtain your consent before any of your personal information is available to us.
Our technologies are able to work in a similar fashion:
on a webpage by relying on cookies, which are supported by most web browsers;
on a mobile application by relying on the mobile advertising ID provided by mobile operating system vendors (e. g. Google and Apple);
on an browser which default settings limit the use of third-party cookies and inter-site tracking, such as Safari, if you provide consent for our services to co-exist with these default settings;
and in a transversal way between the different environments listed above. Find out more about
how our services work from one environment to another (“cross-device linking”)
.
In order to provide you with ads that are better tailored to your interests, we may receive and process audience and segments information derived from the data you accepted to share with trusted third party partners. These partners may send us information regarding your shopping habits (e.g. interested in clothing, furniture or electronics), the points of interest that are near you based on non-precise geolocation information (e.g. stores that are geographically close to you) or the products you have been purchasing in a brick and mortar store of the advertisers that are using our services to manage their online marketing campaigns. In such case, Criteo will only process geolocation information and identifiers (such as cookie IDs and Mobile Advertising IDs) that do not allow us to know who you are.
We believe that the personalization of ads is beneficial to you and the Internet ecosystem in that it contributes to the promotion of a free and open Internet by allowing Publishers to monetize the content they create, while allowing you to benefit from ads that may be more interesting to you than non-personalized ads that would be displayed to you.
Our privacy pillars
We have developed our services and technologies taking great care to respect your privacy.
Data minimisation
We undertake never to use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc. Without ever being able to identify you personally, our technologies are able to recognize your devices and/or browsers on the basis of an identifier consisting of a series of characters (identifier contained in a cookie or other). However, these data are qualified as personal data by European regulations and personal information by Californian law. As such, they are the subject of our greatest vigilance in terms of security and respect for your privacy.
Privacy by design
Our product teams develop every feature with privacy in mind; it’s the cornerstone of Privacy by Design, Criteo’s long-standing practice and commitment to ensuring industry-leading privacy, security and safety for consumers and marketers.
Key elements include:
As required by the GDPR, we have had a designated Data Privacy Officer since 2013 along with a team of privacy experts.
These experts sit within the Product and R&D organization. They perform ongoing Privacy Impact Assessments to monitor potential risks during the product lifecycle and proactively mitigate those risks.
The Data Privacy team delivers company-wide privacy training, enforces codes of conduct, and is integral to ensuring that we build best-in-class products and services.
We regularly review and document our internal policies, amend existing privacy policies as necessary, and enforce these policies with our partners and vendors.
Criteo's commitments
Our ads do not require:
To collect data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, your postal address, or your email address in plain text.
To collect sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health or sexual orientation …) to create segments or target ads to users.
