Website privacy notice
When you browse the web, you leave a digital footprint. It's information about your device and the
                    way you use it online.
We just want to let you know that we'll collect this information about you. Most websites do this.
We use this information to deliver the website to you. We also use it for other things, which we
                    think help you and us.
We've put this notice together to explain this.
By the way, when we say "we" this means M&S Bank, other HSBC group companies and our trusted partners
                    who provide services to us.
These include our:
Technology providers.
Cybersecurity companies.
Social media partners.
Advertising partners.
