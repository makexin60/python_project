Optimizing security efforts and limited resources to properly protect OneSpan Information Systems and Information Assets requires a structured approach to identify the various assets needing to be protected, their relative importance to OneSpan, as well as the risks faced by such assets. We identify the security measures already in place, assess their effectiveness to help measure the residual risk, and prioritize any changes that would be required to lower the risk to an acceptable level for OneSpan.
