3.3 DIFFERENT KINDS OF COOKIES
Cookies can be installed by the operator of the website the user is visiting (“first party cookies”) or by other websites (“third party cookies”):

Third-party cookies - when you use our Website, cookies from third-party providers may be transmitted to you. If you visit a website that has embedded content, such as YouTube videos for example, these websites may transmit cookies to you. The Data Controller does not monitor the settings of such cookies. We recommend that you ask for more information about these cookies on the websites of such third-party providers, and find out the corresponding options for managing them.

Functional cookies: these cookies allow the user to browse as a function of certain pre-determined criteria (e.g., the language, the products selected for purchase) in order to improve the service offered.
