our privacy & cookie policy
Below we share a summary of how we process and use personal data in Brown Thomas Arnotts. (Last updated - 28th October 2021)
We have developed this privacy statement because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal details when you visit or use the Brownthomas.ie website. We respect your right to privacy. We treat as confidential all of the personal information you give to us. By using the Brown Thomas website or by registering as a user of any services provided by Brown Thomas, you agree to our use of your data as set out below. Brown Thomas is registered with the Data Protection Commissioner as a Data Controller and all handling and processing of your personal data is strictly in accordance with the data protection principles contained in the Data Protection Acts 1988 – 2018. The Brown Thomas servers are located in a secure facility and any access to your personal data is strictly controlled and limited only to persons who are authorised and have appropriate security clearance to access the servers. Saved payment card details are transmitted by Brown Thomas in an encrypted form to provide extra security for your online transactions. They are only shared with our payment partner and not with any other third parties and are only used to process your order, using our payment partner.
The software we use, which is called “Adyen 3DS2 SDK” conforms to a security specification known as “EMVCo”. This industry standard software will allow the collection of device fingerprinting without you having to take any action. When you use your device or phone while shopping online, the software will automatically collect the required device fingerprint automatically in order to enhance the security offered by way of allowing a risk based assessment to take place. The software will then encrypt and secure the information collected as part of the operation of the software. As the information is fully encrypted, neither Adyen nor any other party can access or view the contents of your information and information collected is only used as part of the automated system process to protect you while online or making a purchase.

These parties may be involved in the delivery of goods or services to you but it may be necessary for us to give them information about you for that purpose. You will be informed about this when you use such a service.

2. Standard Contractual Clauses
3. Transfer to a Safe Country (e.g. Canada)

This data sharing is necessary to fulfil your purchase agreement and perform a credit check (where applicable).

Your Rights
You have a number of rights under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.
Right of Access – you have a right to request a copy of data we hold about you.
Right of Rectification – You can request that we correct any errors in the information we hold about you.
Right of Erasure – You have a right to request we delete information we hold about you in certain circumstances. This is not an absolute right, but deleting data about you may result in you not being able to avail of services such as warranties and will result in the loss of any loyalty card points or other benefits you may have earned.
Right to Object to Processing – You have a right to object to processing, particularly processing for the purposes of Direct Marketing. This is not an absolute right as we may have an over-riding requirement to continue processing your data. If we do opt you out of processing we may not be able to let you know about special offers or sales and it might have other implications depending on the specific processing you object to.
Right to Restrict Processing – You have a right to ask us not to process your data for a period of time for a particular reason, for example if you have queried the accuracy of data we hold about you. Again, this is not an absolute right and it only applies in certain circumstances.
Right to Data Portability – You have the right to ask us to transfer data we hold about you in a structured form and process using automated means to another company. This only applies if the basis of the processing is consent or contract.
Right not to be subject to Automated Decision Making – You have a right not to be subject to automated decision making that has a legal or equivalent effect unless that processing is necessary for entering into or performing a contract, is required by law, or is conducted with your explicit consent. An example of such processing would include in-store credit checking.
You have a right to compensation through the Courts in the event your data privacy rights under legislation are not upheld.
To avail of any of these rights, you should contact the Data Protection Officer in writing at the contact details below. There is no fee for availing of these rights, but we reserve the right to charge a reasonable administrative fee for repeat requests for the same information or for excessive requests.

The general guidelines for how long we retain data are based on a clear assessment of what is necessary and proportionate in our business, with particular reference to statutory obligations that apply to our business.
Where there is no statutory period defined for keeping data, we will apply retention periods based on relevant industry standards or based on an internal assessment of a retention period that balances our ability to serve customers with our obligation to not retain identifiable data for longer than we need to.
Sharing And Disclosure Of Data

For compliance with a legal obligation under EU or Member State law
To meet the requirements of a Court Order
For the purposes of seeking legal advice or managing an insurance claim
Transfer of data outside the EU/EEA
We transfer data outside the EU/EEA for a variety of reasons. Whenever possible we seek to work with partners, suppliers, and service providers in the EU/EEA but this is not always an option. We keep service providers who are based outside the EU/EEA under review to ensure valid legal grounds exist to continue using them.

Safety comes standard
When we say we’re there for you, we mean it.
With every click, we make sure your data and information is protected. That means every time you open the app, we make sure it’s really you and each time you make a payment, we encrypt your personal information, making sure it stays between us.
Pay it safe
Fraud detection is at the heart of Klarna's security. We can quickly respond to unusual activity on your account, and if needed, we will ask for an extra security step called a multi-factor authentication (MFA), which will ensure that it’s really you making a purchase and giving you peace of mind that your financial information is safe.
Shop securely with buyer protection
If you shop with Klarna and run into issues, like your order doesn't arrive or it's not what you expected, we've got your back. Just give the store a chance to sort it out first, and if that doesn't help, we'll step in to help you get a refund and even pause your payments in case of returns.
See how it works
You’re in the driver’s seat
When it comes to your data, it isn’t just a question of keeping it safe, it’s about making it easy for you to be in control of your information. We’ll also send you a notification whenever you make a change to your account and an alert with every new login into you account.

Security tips
Shopping should be fun, but it's important to be aware of potential risks to help you stay safe. That's where our security tips come into play.
We want to prevent scams and unauthorised activity from happening in the first place. These tips are straightforward and easy to apply, so don’t wait - dive into our tips to stay in the loop.
1. Unexpected messages
Scammers often initiate contact through unsolicited emails, phone calls, or text messages and extract sensitive information.
2. Time crunch
Scammers often create a false sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly without thinking.
3. The more you know
Before shopping or sharing personal details online, make sure the website is legit and secure.
4. Too good to be true
Scammers may ask you to pay using gift cards, the Klarna app, or even a wire transfer with the expectation you’ll receive even more in return.
I receive a suspicious email/text message?
Do not click any links or open attachments from unexpected or unverified sources. Always be cautious of communication requesting personal or financial information, demanding immediate action, or simply does not look right. If possible, flag the message as spam or junk. Your awareness and vigilance are the best lines of defence.
I shared my personal identification or authentication code to someone I don’t know?
Immediately contact Klarna and any other relevant institutions involved to notify them about the incident. Swift action could trigger preventative measures that can avert further complications. Change all relevant passwords and monitor your financial statements closely for any signs of unauthorised activity.
I have lost my device or physical card?
Immediately contact Klarna to report the lost device or card. Freeze your card to prevent unauthorised charges. Similarly, if a device like a phone or laptop is lost, change all passwords for accounts accessible on the device and inform relevant institutions about possible unauthorised access - especially if the device is auto-logged into any financial or personal accounts.
I see unauthorised activity on my account?
Immediately contact Klarna to report the suspicious activity. Consider changing any log-in credentials you believe could be compromised and enable additional security measures like two-factor authentication. Regularly monitoring your account for unfamiliar activity can help detect potential fraud early.
I am asked to make an urgent payment?
Always double-check before conducting any transactions, particularly those demanding urgently and unexpectedly. Contact the requester via a different, trusted method to confirm its legitimacy.
I suspect an online shopping site could be fraudulent?
Before sharing information online, research the company, check reviews, and confirm valid contact information.
Make sure the website is legit and secure. Double check the website’s URL is spelled correctly. Also, look for "https://" in the URL which means the data you send to the site is encrypted, providing an extra layer of security. Especially when using public Wi-Fi networks. If something feels off, trust your instincts.
I clicked an unknown link and it downloaded a file?
Do not open the file. Delete it immediately and run a virus scan. Ensure you have up-to-date antivirus software installed to protect against malicious downloads. Continue to monitor your financial statements closely for any unauthorised activity.
I am contacted by someone claiming they're from a well-known company?
Always proceed with caution when contacted unexpectedly, even if they appear to be legitimate from a place you trust. If in doubt, end the conversation and independently contact the company directly using a verified method such as the customer service number listed on their official website. It’s always better to double-check before sharing any personal or financial information.
