How We Share Your Information
Personal Information
We may share any information we receive with our affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

However, we may share your Personal Information with third-party advertising partners for our marketing and advertising purposes, such as custom audience creation, lookalike modeling, and targeted advertising. Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org
) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (
https://optout.aboutads.info
). If you do not wish to receive personalized ads, please visit their opt-out pages to learn about how you may opt out of receiving web-based personalized ads from member companies. You can access any settings offered by your mobile operating system to limit ad tracking, or you can install the AppChoices mobile app to learn more about how you may opt out of personalized ads in mobile apps.
We may also share your Personal Information with our vendors, service providers, agents, representatives, and contractors so they can provide us with support services and other features. For example, we may share your Personal Information with cloud service providers (such as
Google Cloud
), payment processors (such as
Stripe
), advertising service providers (such as Google and Facebook), and analytics partners (such as
Bugsee
and
Unity
).

Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Website.

We may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of our products, services, assets and/or businesses.

Processing Personal Data
Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data
If you are an individual in the European Union (EU) or an EU citizen, we collect and process data about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. This means we collect and process your data only when:
It is necessary for a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your individual privacy interests), such as preventing fraud, improving the Service, and increasing the security of the Service and network infrastructure;
You have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose;
It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations; or
It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us using the information in the Contact for Individual Rights Requests section. Some examples of our legitimate interests and the data being processed include:
Network and information security (password, IP address, Device ID)
Customer Support and fraud prevention (name, email address)
Improving our products and services (hardware information, activity logs)
Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object. More information on exercising this right can be found in the
Individual Rights
section below.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us at
privacy@playosmo.com
.
Transfers, Storage, and Processing - Important Information for Users Outside the U.S.
We primarily store data about you, including personal information, on servers located and operated within the United States. If you reside outside of the United States, in order to provide and operate the Service, we may send and store your personal information (also commonly referred to as personal data) outside of the country where you reside or are located, to the United States. Therefore, our collection and use of your personal information is subject to the United States’ laws related to privacy and use of personal data and information.
These laws may be less protective than those applicable to you in your country of residence. By accepting the terms of this privacy policy, you acknowledge, agree and consent to (1) the transfer to and processing of personal information on servers located outside of the country where you reside, (2) our collection and use of your personal information as described herein and in accordance with the laws of the United States that may be different and may be less protective than those in your country and (3) that you are taking a risk by using the service.
Whenever we share personal information originating in the EU with an entity outside of the EU, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses.
Your Choices About Your Information
You may, of course, decline to share certain personal information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service. You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account preferences page on the Website or contacting us at
support@playosmo.com
. Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. To update, correct, or delete any other personal information, please see the
Individual Rights
section below for more information.
If you receive promotional email from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email. You may also opt-out from receiving promotional email from us, and any other promotional communications that we may send to you from time to time, by using the account management tools on our website at
https://my.playosmo.com
or sending your request to us by email at
privacy@playosmo.com
.
Please be aware that if you opt-out of receiving promotional email from us or otherwise modify the nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from us, it may take up to ten business days for us to process your request, and you may receive promotional communications from us that you have opted-out from during that period. Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us regarding the Service.
Individual Rights
Tangible Play also makes certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal data. Please review the below information outlining your choices and how to exercise them. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe.
Review and Update Your Data
You have the right to access and update any personal data that we have collected. Some personal data, such as the account holder’s name and email address can be found and updated using the account management tools on our website at
https://my.playosmo.com
. For any personal data beyond this, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section. We may request more information to confirm your identity before modifying any personal data.
Delete Your Data
You also have the right to have your personal data deleted. This is sometimes known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. To request that we delete all personal data about you, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section. We may request more information to confirm your identity before deleting any personal data.
Using the “Delete Account” function on
https://my.playosmo.com
WILL NOT automatically remove all of your personal data from our system. You must submit a request using the below information if you wish to delete all personal data from our system.
After you delete your personal data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems, for archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim.
Restrict Processing
You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances. In some ways, this is an alternative to requesting the erasure of your data. Rather than requesting we erase all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease processing it.
Data Portability
You have the right to obtain copies of your information in a structured, commonly used format that permits you to move your data between our service and the services of others. We may request more information to confirm your identity before providing any personal data.
Right to Object
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or when our processing of your data is based on legitimate interests. You may request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.
If any request made under this section is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies. If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.

How We Protect Your Information - Security and Passwords
Tangible Play takes what it believes to be commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information. However, since no security system is impenetrable and “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information or Browsing Information.
If you create an account to use the Website, you may be asked to choose a password for your account, which can be used to access information associated with your account (including Personal Information). You should choose a password that is not easy to guess, and does not use words that you would find in a dictionary. Do not disclose your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and we will attribute activities that occur using your account information (e.g., through the use of your password) to you. If you suspect that your password has been compromised, contact us immediately at
privacy@playosmo.com
.
Email and Recommendation Communications That We May Send
We may send you, or you may elect to sign up to receive, emails from us. To help us understand whether we are providing information of interest to you, we may include software code or other tracking technologies in our emails to monitor whether you opened a particular email, whether you have clicked on the images and/or links in the email, the date and time the message was opened, and whether your computer is capable of receiving HTML-based email. We endeavor to allow you to unsubscribe at any time from our email programs by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email message. We reserve the right to send you service announcements or similar administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
We may send you communications within an App regarding recommendations for other Tangible Play Apps. You may opt out of such communications by visiting your account at
https://my.playosmo.com/
, then visiting Profiles, then selecting Games, and finally choosing “Disable Recommended Games” within the Recommendations section. We reserve the right to send you service announcements or similar administrative messages within an App, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
Compromise of Personal Information
In the event that Personal Information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Tangible Play will promptly notify those persons whose Personal Information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law. In the event that we or our Service suffers a data security breach that requires us to provide you with notice, such as under applicable law, you consent to allow us to provide you with such notice by sending an email to the primary email address that is associated with your account.
Notification Procedures
It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by Tangible Play in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.
Links To Third-Party Content
The Website may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties. Any information you provide on third-party websites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Website. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party websites or services to which links or access are provided through the Website. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.
Children’s Privacy Policy
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. The Website is not intended for children, does not market to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. All references to “children” or “child” in this Children’s Privacy Policy shall mean children under 16 years of age, and all references to the term “parent” shall include legal guardians.
Tangible Play makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its Apps and the Osmo Play Experience comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). While inside the Osmo Play Experience, all play is locally stored, and no Personal Information is collected or solicited from a child user. Game progress may be stored remotely to facilitate multi-device play and allow parents to view their child’s progress. The Osmo Play Experience contains no external links to third-party websites or services.
The Osmo Play Experience is available by downloading one or all of our Apps to your devices. The Osmo Play Experience is directed at users of all ages, including children. We encourage parents and teachers to supervise their child or student’s use of the Apps and supervise the overall Osmo Play Experience. Simply downloading any Osmo App to your devices does not trigger the collection of any personally identifiable information. We collect only a unique device identifier (a 40-character long mathematical code, called a “hex value”). This device identifier only allows Tangible Play to send necessary administrative updates to your tablet (such as software updates and administrative messages). No Personal Information is collected by Osmo through the App download process or during the Osmo Play Experience. We may collect analytics data (which does not contain Personal Information) from your use of the Service in order to offer and develop the Service, and we may collect information such as age and nickname from you as part of your use of the Apps and the Service and the creation of your user profile.
Certain features within our Apps, that are outside the Osmo Play Experience, (such as the email sharing feature within Masterpiece for Osmo) may allow children users to input Personal Information such as a friend’s email address, or may otherwise process or record a child’s activities within the app, such as the pattern of their drawing or other creations. In addition, users may request that drawings, word albums, and other user creations (together, the “User Creations”) made in our Apps be shared to the broader community of users via the myOsmo section on our Website. These features are designed so that no Personal Information is uploaded back to or stored on our web servers unless consented to by the parent or teacher account holder, or in such a manner that is otherwise exempt from or compliant with COPPA. We review all User Creation submissions to ensure no obvious Personal Information is included before any User Creations are made available publicly.
If the Service is being used by a school and/or teacher (the “Educational Institution”) with students that are under 16 years of age, such Educational Institution agrees that it has reviewed our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. Tangible Play only requests Personal Information from parents and/or teachers and we will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, Personal Information from users known to be under 16 years of age. We collect only the minimum amount of information needed about students from teachers, and any such information is used only in connection with the Educational Institution’s use of the Osmo Play Experience.
If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Website at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information has been provided to us and/or collected on the Website from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, such as through a support request, we take the appropriate steps to delete or hash this information in a secure manner. If you are a parent and discover that your child under 16 years of age has obtained an account on the Website, then you may alert us at
support@playosmo.com
and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our systems. A parent or teacher can visit his or her account online at any time to delete any information and/or the account.
