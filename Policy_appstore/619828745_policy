        Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect,
        how we use it, and to whom we may disclose it to in accordance with
        Qatar’s applicable legal and regulatory frameworks. This policy
        applies to the Ooredoo family of businesses. It does not apply to the
        personal information that you may give to other service providers or third
        parties that are not affiliated with Ooredoo. By using our services, you
        acknowledge your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.

Ooredoo collects and processes information about you when you choose
        Ooredoo as your service provider and when you use our products and
        services, including our telecommunications services, websites, apps and
        social media. Without this information, we may not be able to provide you
        with requested services or develop and improve upon those services or meet
        our legal obligations.

        used to verify your identity and comply with applicable laws.
Service and device usage information

        information regarding how you use our services, including information
        about the calls you make and the websites you visit. We may also collect
        information about any of your service options including TV packages and

        billing statements, improve your customer experiences, inform you of
        service updates and special promotions and offers for new products and
        services that may be of interest to you.
Customer service and support

        record your call when you contact our customer service representatives to
        help us train employees and to better serve you. We will always let you
        know when we do. If you contact us for technical service support, we may
        also access information about your computer, wireless device or other
        device settings to provide customized support or to install specific
        applications or services that you use or that are necessary for the
        applications or services you use.

. Ooredoo uses information that
        you provide to us through your interactions with our services and
        platforms to send you promotional messages and advertising that we think

        used to contact you in the event that you win a prize, improve our
        services, enhance your experience and to develop new and better services.

        customers. For example, we check for signal strength, dropped calls, data
        failures, and other network performance issues. We use this information to
        enhance network planning, engineering and technical support, ensure
        quality control and improve the functionality of our services.

        uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes. We share
        your information with those vendors and partners when it is necessary for
        them to perform work on our behalf for example to help us complete
        transactions associated with credit/debit card processing, billing,
        shipping, repairs, customer service, auditing, and marketing of Ooredoo
        products and services. When Ooredoo shares personal information with these
        vendors and partners, we require them to protect it and only to use it for
        the purposes for which it was provided. We do not permit vendors and
        partners for example to use this information for their own marketing
        purposes.
Legal process & protection
. Ooredoo may be required
        to disclose personal information, and other information about you to
        satisfy requests from governmental agencies. Ooredoo is also legally
        required to provide information about your credit history to Qatar’s
        Credit Bureau.
Directory services.
Ooredoo is entitled to publish the
        names, addresses and telephone numbers of its fixed line customers or may
        provide this information to directory publishers, directory assistance
        services or other directory service providers. If you wish your fixed
        number to be unpublished, you should communicate this to Ooredoo and pay
        the relevant fee, if any. Ooredoo does not publish directories of customer
        mobile phone numbers, and we do not make them available to others for
        listing in directories unless you request that we do so. We also provide
        the names and telephone numbers of mobile and fixed line customers for
        Caller ID and similar services.
De-identified and aggregated information
. We may provide
        information that is aggregated and does not identify you personally to
        third-parties for market research. This research supports the development
        of our new products and services, improves existing services and helps us
        better understand consumer choices and preferences.
How Can You Limit the Sharing and Use of Your Personal
          Information
Disabling cookies.
You can limit the collection of
        certain information by deleting or disabling cookies on your computer or
        device. For example, most Internet browsers have a feature that enables
        you to erase stored cookies, block all cookies, or receive a warning
        before a cookie is stored. Keep in mind that disabling cookies may also
        prevent you from using specific features on these sites, including
        ordering products or services and maintaining an online account.
Disabling location services
. Most mobile devices allow
        you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in
        the device’s setting menu.
Third-party applications and services
. Ooredoo is not
        responsible for the third-party applications you select and install on
        your devices and the manner in which these third-parties collect, use,
        share, or disclose your personal information. We are also not responsible
        for the marketing messages that you may receive via our networks from
        retailers and other organizations that you have given your personal
        information to. The manner in which these companies treat personal
        information is governed by the terms and conditions of their own privacy
        policies and not by the Ooredoo Privacy Policy.
Keeping Children Safe
Ooredoo does not intentionally collect, use or disclose information about
        children. If you allow a child to use your device or our services, you
        should be aware that their information may be collected as described in
        this policy.
Parents and guardians should be vigilant in protecting the safety and
        privacy of children online. For example, Qatari law prohibits owners or
        operators of child-based websites registered in Qatar from collecting or
        using any information relating to a child without the parent’s or
        the guardian’s prior explicit consent. These website owners or
        operators must also provide a notice on their website that describes what
        information they collect and how they process it. If you find or suspect
        that a website based in Qatar or elsewhere is violating the safety, trust
        and integrity of minors, please contact Ooredoo Customer Care or
        responsible government authorities.
Information Security and Unauthorized Access
Ooredoo has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to
