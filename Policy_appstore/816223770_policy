I'm contesting the accuracy of the personal information, you must restrict processing until you have verified its accuracy.
The processing is unlawful and, instead of requesting deletion of the information, I am requesting a restriction.
I believe you no longer require the personal information for processing but I may require it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
I have objected to the processing based on your legitimate interests and you are still in the process of considering whether your legitimate interests override mine.
Restriction is necessary for performance of a public interest task or for the purpose of your legitimate interests and you are still in the process of considering whether your legitimate interests in processing the information override mine.
You may provide below any additional information that you believe is necessary to process your request, such as a unique identifier of your account or personal information, or the purpose of your request. Doing so is entirely optional. If we need more information to identify your account or personal information, we will ask you for that information.
