Dissapionted
I looked at the description an it said you can record gameplay, but when I open the app, it doesn't show anything about recording. Also, the viewpoint is to sensitive and keeps on bobbing around, so I always get caught. I would also like to say, it's very laggy, and doesn't feel like the PC version at all. Please change these problems, and thank you.
