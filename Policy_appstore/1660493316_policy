YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. It is
our
policy to respect your rights and
we
will act promptly and in accordance with any applicable law, rule or regulation relating to the processing of your personal data.
Details of your rights are set out below:
right to be informed about how personal data is used – you have a right to be informed about how we will use and share your personal data. This explanation will be provided to you in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible format and will be written in clear and plain language;
right to access personal data – you have a right to obtain confirmation of whether we are processing your personal data, access to your personal data and information regarding how your personal data is being used by us;
right to have inaccurate personal data rectified – you have a right to have any inaccurate or incomplete personal data rectified. If we have disclosed the relevant personal data to any third parties, we will take reasonable steps to inform those third parties of the rectification where possible;
right to have personal data erased in certain circumstances – you have a right to request that certain personal data held by us is erased. This is also known as the right to be forgotten. This is not a blanket right to require all personal data to be deleted. We will consider each request carefully in accordance with the requirements of any laws relating to the processing of your personal data;
·
right to restrict the processing of personal data in certain circumstances – you have a right to block the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This right arises if you are disputing the accuracy of personal data, if you have raised an objection to processing, if the processing of personal data is unlawful and you oppose erasure and request restriction instead or if the personal data is no longer required by us but you require the personal data to be retained to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim;
right to data portability – in certain circumstances, you can request to receive a copy of your personal data in a commonly used electronic format. This right only applies to personal data that you have provided to us (for example, by completing a form or providing information through a website). Information about you which has been gathered by monitoring your behaviour will also be subject to the right to data portability. The right to data portability only applies if the processing is based on your consent or if the personal data must be processed for the performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means (i.e. electronically);
right to object to the processing of personal data in certain circumstances, including where personal data is used for marketing purposes – you have a right to object to processing being carried out by us if (a) we are processing personal data based on legitimate interests or for the performance of a task in the public interest (including profiling), (b) if we are using personal data for direct marketing purposes, or (c) if information is being processed for scientific or historical research or statistical purposes. You will be informed that you have a right to object at the point of data collection and the right to object will be explicitly brought to your attention and be presented clearly and separately from any other information; and
right not to be subject to automated decisions where the decision produces a legal effect or a similarly significant effect – you have a right not to be subject to a decision which is based on automated processing where the decision will produce a legal effect or a similarly significant effect on you.
You may exercise any of your rights using the contact details set out in Section 3. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one calendar month (or earlier in accordance with applicable laws). Occasionally it may take us longer than one calendar month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
13.
SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
X
Tool is a part of a corporate organization that has several legal entities (collectively, "xTool entities"), business processes, management structures, and technical systems. Any information that we collect or that you provide to us may be shared and processed by any xTool entity in order to provide the Service.
We may have to share your personal data with the entities and persons set out below for the purposes for which we collected the personal data, as detailed in Section 7 (HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA) and Section 8 (PURPOSES AND LEGAL BASIS).
Where required, we will (subject to applicable laws and any terms of business which we may enter into with you) disclose your personal data to:
any person or entity to whom we are required or requested to make such disclosure by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any governmental, taxation, or other regulatory authority, law enforcement agency, or similar body;
Third parties to whom we outsource certain services such as, without limitation, IT systems or software providers, IT Support service providers, and information storage providers;
Third-party service providers to assist us with user analytics, such as Google Analytics; and
Please note this list is non-exhaustive and there may be other examples where we need to share with other parties in order to provide the Service as effectively as we can.
We may share your personal data with persons or entities outside of xTool to whom we may sell or transfer parts of our business or assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, the part of our business that is (as the case may be) sold, acquired, or is the merged entity may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this
policy
.
We require any person or entity to whom we disclose personal data pursuant to this Section 13 to respect the confidentiality and security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We do not allow such recipients of your personal data to use it for their own purposes, and we only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
14.
THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS AND OTHER CONTROLLERS
As mentioned above, we may appoint sub-contractor data processors as required to deliver the Service, such as, without limitation, IT systems or software providers, IT Support service providers, and information storage providers, who will process personal data on our behalf and at our direction. We conduct an appropriate level of due diligence and put in place contractual documentation in relation to any sub-contractor to ensure that they process personal data appropriately and according to our legal and regulatory obligations.
Further, we may appoint external data controllers where necessary to deliver the Service. When doing so, we will comply with our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to the personal data, including without limitation, putting appropriate safeguards in place.
What is our legal basis?
It is necessary for us to perform our obligations in accordance with any contract that we may have with you.
It is in our legitimate interest or a third party’s legitimate interest to use personal information in such a way as to ensure that we provide the Service in the best way that we can.
In some cases, the parties which we use to process personal data on our behalf are based outside the EEA, therefore their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of such data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission (in the case of transfers out of the EEA); and/or
where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission (in the case of transfers out of the EEA), in both cases which give personal data the same protection it has within the EEA.
For individuals based in mainland China: In due course, we will publish a list of the recipients to provide notice of the parties that can independently determine processing purposes and methods when processing your personal data, including their contact details and details on what, how and why such recipients process your personal data. Should you require such information in the meantime, please contact us using the contact details in Section 3.
15.
SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We are committed to keeping the personal data provided to us secure, and we have implemented appropriate information security policies, rules, and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, and unlawful destruction or accidental loss, including:
the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;
the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and
a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.
We ensure that those who have permanent or regular access to personal data, or that are involved in the processing of personal data, or in the development of tools used to process personal data, are trained and informed of their rights and responsibilities in when processing personal data, and are obliged to respect the confidentiality of such personal information.
16.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. This includes for example the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements, to carry out legal work, for the establishment or defence of legal claims.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
If you would like to know more about the retention periods we apply to your personal data, please contact us using the contact details in Section 3.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
