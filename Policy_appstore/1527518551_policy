                process in which the subject of personal information cannot be identified and the processed information
                cannot be recovered through the technical processing of personal information. The information
                obtained after anonymization of personal information does not belong to personal information.)

3. Special description
Virtual Items and subscription services require users to purchase from officially approved channels such
                as App Store/Google Play or Yalla Pay Center,
Handing over your account to others for operation, conducting private transactions with
                others, prohibited proxy recharge ( any purchase of Golds and Diamonds through unofficial
                channels, or entrusting accounts to others to recharge on their behalf are strictly forbidden. The
                common types of prohibited proxy recharges (including but not limited to, purchase and recharge
                from nonofficial third-party recharge platforms, private transactions with third parties, and provision
                of user accounts to log in and recharge from third-party devices) or malicious refunds after recharging
                are all violations of the platform rules. These actions will disrupt the normal management of the
                platform, and will also put users' accounts and personal information at risk including
                but not limited to the leakage of users' information, fraudulent use of credit cards, failure of
                recharge, and the malicious theft of accounts. Moreover, these types of recharge and/or refunds are
                mostly scams, which can easily cause property damage. Yalla Ludo will always crack down on the
                aforementioned behaviors and maintain the right to pursue legal liabilities according to applicable law.
In response to the aforesaid violations, the platform has rights to take measures including but
                not limited to the following:
Take back all the virtual currency and purchased items in the account suspected of proxy charging or
                    malicious refund.
Freeze all remaining virtual items in the accountsuspected of the malicious refund until the refund
                    is canceled or the amount of refund is reimbursed in full.
Time-limited or permanent ban on the account.
We are not liablefor any losses or damages caused by recharging on unofficial proxy recharge,
                    malicious refunds, or account transactions.
You may cancel your account at any time, and Yalla Ludo may terminate your account in accordance with the
                Terms. All the Golds and Diamonds in your account will be forfeited immediately upon the cancellation or
                termination of your account. There will be no refunds for any unused or unredeemed Golds and Diamonds.
