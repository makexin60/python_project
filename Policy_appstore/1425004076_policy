Privacy Policy
HighLevel LLC (referred to as “Company,” “us” or “we”) recognizes that your privacy is important.
This Policy discloses the privacy practices for HighLevel’s website (the “Site”), as well as related products and services we may offer to you (the “Service”). This Policy also covers how personal and other information that we receive or collect about you and your clients (“Clients”) is treated. Please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use of this Site.
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account, by placing a prominent notice on our site, and by updating any privacy information on this page. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services available through this Site after such modifications will constitute your (a) acknowledgment of the modified Policy; and (b) your agreement to abide and be bound by that Policy.
IMPORTANT: BY USING THE SITE AND/OR OFFERINGS AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE, YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SITE.
1. Types of Information We Collect
In order to better provide you with our Service, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Aggregate Information.
Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for an account, downloading or purchasing a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in a public forum on this Site, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.
Examples of PII may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address (including zip code), employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other identifying information. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number.
Aggregate Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site and what other sites may have directed you to us. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
2. How We Collect and Use Information
HighLevel do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be required to provide certain PII to us when you elect to use certain products or services available on the Site. These may include: (a) registering for an account on our Site; (b) uploading individual transaction data obtained from your third-party invoicing or accounting applications (for example, “QuickBooks,” “Xero,” “Clio” etc.), (c) uploading user generated content and other information uploaded to the Site (d)sending us an email message; (e) submitting a form or transmitting other information by telephone or letter; or (e) submitting your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our Site.
We will primarily use your PII to provide product or service offerings to you. We will also use certain forms of PII to enhance the operation of our Site, improve our internal marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our Site’s content, layout, and services. We may use certain information about you without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content. We may also use PII to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Finally, we may use your PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy.
We may also collect or our third party advertising partners may collect, certain Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information. Our third party advertising partners may also provide us with aggregate, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at out Site.
3. Cookies
Depending on how you use our Site, we will store cookies on your computer in order to collect certain aggregate data about our users and to customize certain aspects of your specific user experience. A cookie is a small data text file which is stored on your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies may also include more personalized information, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and your first name to welcome you back to our Site. We may use cookies to perform tasks such as: monitoring aggregate site usage metrics, storing and remembering your passwords (if you allow us to do so), storing account and advertising preferences that you have set, and personalizing the Services we make available to you. However, we do not use cookies to track your browsing behaviors.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some aspects of the Site may not function properly if you elect to disable cookies.
4. Release of Information
HighLevel will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others. We do provide some of our product and service offerings through contractual arrangements made with affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties (“Service Partners”). We and our Service Partners may need to use some PII in order to perform tasks between our respective sites, or to deliver products or services to you. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this Site; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us provide customer service.
We will encourage our Service Partners to adopt and promote strong privacy policies. However, the use of your PII by our Service Partners is governed the respective privacy policies of those providers, and is not subject to our control. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other Sites accessible through this Site, including our Advertising and Service Partners, have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each Site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.
Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide PII to the appropriate governmental authorities. In such cases, we will disclose PII upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
We may also provide Aggregate Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.
5. Updating and Correcting Information
We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the PII that you have provided to us. You may change any of your PII in your account online at any time by linking to your account in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this Site.
We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, some information, such as past transactions, logs of technical support calls, or other information may not be deleted. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.
6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information
We may, from time to time, send you email regarding new products and services that we feel may interest you. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally call or send you direct mail about products and services that may be of interest to you. Only HighLevel (or agents working on behalf of HighLevel and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these solicitations, and only if you have previously indicated that you wish to receive them. If you do not want to receive solicitations from us, you can “opt-out” by accessing your account online editing your account information to no longer receive such offers and mailings.
You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described above. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our Site may not work properly in your case.
7. Security of Your PII
At our Site you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current industry standards. We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your PII. For example:
•	We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable, accurate, complete and current. We encrypt all PII, in order to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us. We also only keep collected information: only for as long as reasonably necessary and use it only for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
•	We limit access to PII only to specific employees, contractors and agents who have a reasonable need to come into contact with your information. For example, we may provide members of our technical support team with limited access to your account in order to allow them to troubleshoot problems you may be having with the Site.
•	Additionally, we also employ a number of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect PII. Our secure servers and our data centers are protected by industry-standard encryption, and our servers reside behind firewalls and employ high-level password protection.
•	Finally, access by you to your PII is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
In order to most effectively serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking institutions and processing agents (such as e.g. PayPal). They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed. As we have no control or ability to monitor the security of your device, you should take measures reasonably available to secure your device.
In the event that PII is compromised as a result of a breach of security, HighLevel will promptly notify those persons whose PII has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, by email, or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to immediately notify us and your Clients if you have experienced a breach of security on your device which may have affected the security of our Site or Service.
8. Miscellaneous
You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this Site. By agreeing to Our Policy, you are hereby confirming that you are at least of 18 years old. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose PII about minor visitors.
You should also be aware that when Personally Identifiable Information is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, email address, etc.) in the discussion forums or other public areas on this Site, that information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages (including unwanted spam messages) from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to such information. Please consult our Site Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement for our Site Conduct policies.
If you have any questions, concerns or inquiries about our Privacy Policy, or our use of your PII, or our privacy practices, please contact us at: support@gohighlevel.com. You can also reach our Privacy Compliance Officer by sending written correspondence to:
HighLevel LLC
Email:

Attn: Privacy Compliance Officer
9. GDPR: European or UK data subjects
Our clients use the HighLevel software to collect and process the personal data of individuals, which may include individuals in the EU and/or the UK. In particular, they use the software to manage their marketing lists and campaigns, which includes the processing of the personal data of their customers.
For the purposes of the GDPR (and the UK GDPR) HighLevel acts as a processor of the personal data of data subjects. The controller of the data subjects’ personal data is either our client, or the customers of our client.
We only process such personal data in accordance with the instructions of our client and in compliance with our obligations as a processor. We ensure that a data processing agreement is entered into between us and our client in order to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place.

Privacy Policy
Last Updated AUGUST 2024
1. Overview
HighLevel Inc. (“HighLevel,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through compliance with this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use your Personal Information when you visit our website at
https://www.gohighlevel.com
or otherwise use the Platform as described further in the
Terms of Service
, and that you may provide in electronic messages to HighLevel.
Please read this Privacy Policy to understand our policies and practices regarding your Personal Information and how we will handle it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not use the Platform.  By accessing or using the Platform, you agree and consent to this Privacy Policy.
HighLevel may change this Privacy Policy at any time, at its discretion.
Your continued use of the Platform after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of and consent to those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates.
This Privacy Policy is subject to and governed by the HighLevel Terms of Service. The Services are part of the Platform and are described further in the Terms of Service.
2. The Types of Information That HighLevel Collects About You and How HighLevel Collects Information About You
HighLevel may collect two types of information from you when you visit the Platform: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (collectively “Information”).
“Personal Information” refers to data by which you may be personally identified, such as name, email address, employer, job title and department, and telephone number.
“Non-Personal Information” means data that is about you, but does not identify you specifically. If you do nothing during your visit to our Platform but browse, read pages, or view content, we will gather and store Information about your visit that does not identify you personally.
We collect Information:
Directly from you when you provide it to us.
When you subscribe to a newsletter, create an account, make a purchase or request information from HighLevel, we will ask for things like your name, contact, billing, shipping and communication information, and account ID or credentials in order to fulfill your request. If you set up an appointment with us through the Platform, attend a trade show or event, or otherwise contact us, you may also voluntarily provide similar information.  If you submit any Personal Information about other people to us or to our service providers, you are responsible for making sure that you have the authority to do so and to allow us to use their Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy (for example, by You asking for their consent).
From third parties.
We obtain information through partners, vendors, suppliers and other third parties.  The parties from whom we obtain information are typically corporate enterprises (although some may also be educational or public enterprises) and they may be located in any of the locations in which we do business.  These enterprises largely fall into the following categories: Advertising and marketing companies, data set and information vendors, public database providers, social media platforms, partners, providers of products or services, hosts or vendors at events or trade shows, research partners, or enterprises that use HighLevel Services.  We take steps to confirm that information we receive from these third parties has been collected with your consent or that these parties are otherwise legally permitted to disclose your Personal Information to us.  We might also obtain information through a partner, or co-create datasets with a partner, as part of our business operations.  This kind of data is used for work like improving the Platform and other HighLevel Services, enhancing existing products and developing new capabilities and features.  In some cases we combine Personal Information about individuals that we receive from multiple sources, including directly collected from you or through your use of the Platform.
Automatically as you navigate through the Platform or during the time in which you utilize our Services.
We collect information about how you interact with the Platform through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies.  Please view our separate
Cookies Policy
for more information on our use of cookies and similar technologies, how you can manage cookies and how we respond to Do Not Track signals.
3. How HighLevel Uses Personal Information It Collects About You and the Purposes for the Collection and Use
We use Personal Information that we collect about you or that you provide to us for the following purposes:
For Functionality and Development of the Platform and HighLevel Services.
We use information to provide, offer, and personalize the Platform and other HighLevel Services provided to you.  Some information, like your IP address, is used to communicate with your device to provide network connectivity, measure usage levels of the Platform, diagnose server problems and provide security features.  Other business purposes that depend on use of your information include data analysis related to testing, modifying, improving or developing new products, services and technologies, and to identify trends. Some Platform features may leverage artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools to enhance performance capabilities. We do NOT retain Personal Information to develop, improve, or train generalized AI or machine learning models, including user data provided via third party APIs, including but not limited to Google Workspace APIs. HighLevel Platform’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to
Google API Services User Data Policy
, including the Limited Use requirements. We use cookies to make our websites and the Platform operate, work more efficiently, and provide analytic information. Technologies similar to cookies, such as pixel tags are also used in connection with the Platform. For more information on our use of cookies, please read our
Cookies Policy.
For Customer Support, Platform Updating and Reporting.
The Platform may use information to provide HighLevel with updates and reports, and to check that the Platform is working properly.  Update functions may automatically check your system to see whether files need to be refreshed, updated, or modernized, in order to provide you with the up-to-date security, versions, features, options and controls associated with your systems or devices.  We rely on information to analyze performance and improve and maintain the Platform.  We also rely on Personal Information you provide to us to provide you with customer support for the Platform and other HighLevel Services, and to verify eligibility for promotional offers.
For Business Operations.
We use information to operate our business; for example, to perform accounting, auditing, billing, reconciliation, and collection activities. Other business purposes that depend on use of your Personal Information include crime or fraud monitoring and prevention, protecting our legal rights, and performing contractual obligations.  We also use Personal Information to contact you to advertise, market and sell HighLevel Services in accordance with your communications preferences.
To Communicate.
We use contact information to send messages; to provide HighLevel Services; to respond to customer service requests; to provide alerts such as security updates or changes in our policies or about subscriptions that are ending; and to send marketing or informational materials like newsletters or white papers, in accordance with your communication preferences.  We occasionally conduct surveys, or do focused research or studies which may require you to voluntarily share Personal Information in order to participate.  These activities typically have additional notices that provide more information about the use of your Personal Information and to which you may be asked to consent.
For Advertising and Marketing.
We may use Personal Information collected from you, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, to enable us to provide personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.  You may choose whether to allow or deny uses or sharing of your device’s location by changing your device settings, but if you choose to deny such uses or sharing, we may not be able to provide you with certain personalized HighLevel Services and content on the Platform.
For Statistical Purposes to Improve the Platform
. We may compile Platform statistics into traffic reports, which help HighLevel understand, anticipate, and respond to user needs.  If we learn, for example, of heightened interest in certain aspects of the HighLevel Platform, we are likely to highlight that information on the Platform home page. This Information helps us create a better overall experience for Platform users.
LEGAL BASIS FOR OUR USE (APPLICABLE ONLY TO EEA AND UNITED KINGDOM VISITORS):
If you are in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will collect Personal Information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, where we have a legal obligation to do so, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests (such as processing for administrative purposes, direct marketing, product development or improvement, preventing fraud or criminal acts and in support of information security) and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the time of collection. We will also tell you whether the requirement for that information is mandatory and explain any consequences to you if you do not provide the information.
Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information based on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will take reasonable steps to provide clear notice and describe our legitimate interests.
HighLevel is the Data Controller of all Personal Information collected through the Platform in the EEA and the United Kingdom, except with respect to the Services (where HighLevel is the Data Processor) or where a supplemental Privacy Policy says otherwise. The contact details for HighLevel are set out in the "
HOW TO CONTACT US
” section.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information for any specific processing activity, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “
HOW TO CONTACT US
” Section below.
RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:
We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  We may retain your Personal Information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.  In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS” below for further information.  And in some circumstances we will anonymize your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
4. How HighLevel Protects Your Information
The Platform is designed to provide reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Information against risks such as temporary or permanent loss, destruction, and unauthorized or unlawful access, alteration, use or disclosure.  We require our suppliers and vendors to apply similar protections when they access or use Personal Information that we share with them.  Users of the Platform must also do their part in protecting the data, systems, networks, and service they are utilizing.  No technology, data transmission or system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that your password to any HighLevel account has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting us using the instructions in the “
HOW TO CONTACT US
” section below.
5. When HighLevel Shares Your Information
We work through our affiliates to provide the Platform and other HighLevel Services.  We also work with authorized suppliers and business partners.  When we share your Personal Information with these companies, we put in place appropriate measures to limit the use of your information only for legal and authorized purposes that are consistent with this Privacy Policy, as well as appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We also share information with third parties for advertising and marketing; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of the Platform; and to protect our legal rights.  We may disclose Personal Information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy:
With Affiliates and Subsidiaries.
For purposes limited to and consistent with this Privacy Policy.
With Suppliers.
Our authorized vendors and suppliers may require Personal Information to provide services we have contracted for, such as product delivery, website hosting, data analysis, IT services, auditing, or customer service.  We use a wide variety of software and tools at HighLevel, and we process Personal Information using these tools as a regular course of business.  Our contracts with suppliers and vendors include provisions to protect your Personal Information and limit its use.
With Partners.
We occasionally have relationships with third parties that are not suppliers or vendors but are working with us to offer certain opportunities such as marketing and similar promotions, to enable joint products or research studies, or to facilitate services on the Platform.  In these cases, additional terms or Privacy Policies may be provided.  For third parties or uses not described in this Privacy Policy, we share your information only with a lawful basis to do so.
For Advertising and Marketing.
We share your information with our third-party company partners to prepare and deliver advertising and marketing content, to provide content services and to enable them to provide you with more personalized ads and to study the effectiveness of our campaigns.
In particular, we use third-party companies to communicate regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you, in accordance with your preferences.  You may receive this content by a variety of means such as email, phone or when you access and use the Platform or other HighLevel Services, and other websites.  Content may be based on information obtained, for example, through prior purchases or transactions, through your device’s physical location, through information about what advertisements and content you have viewed, or through cookies and similar technologies relating to your access to and use of the Platform and other websites. Please read our
Cookies Policy
for more information. You can choose whether to allow or deny uses and/or sharing of your device’s location by changing your device settings, but if you choose to deny such uses or sharing, our partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable Platform Services and content.
For Connections to Social Networks and Third Party Services.
Where you are using our Services and have chosen to connect your social networks profiles to the HighLevel Services, or if you authorize a third party service to access your account, you are agreeing to provide information about you to the social networks and the third party services under their respective terms and privacy policies. For example, if you choose to connect your YouTube account to the HighLevel Services, this connection uses YouTube’s API services, and the Google Privacy Policy (located
here
) will apply to you. If you have authorized us to access your information via the YouTube API services, in addition to our normal procedure for deleting stored data, you may revoke our access to your data via the Google security settings page, located
here
.
Sales, Mergers & Acquisitions.
We may disclose Personal Information as part of a contemplated or actual corporate transaction such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
With Your Consent.
HighLevel may disclose your Personal Information to any other person or entity where you consent to the disclosure. For information about how to decline our advertising and marketing, please see the section entitled "Your Choices & Rights" below.
We do NOT share your phone number or opt-in consent with third parties unless we’ve received your express written consent to do so.
We also share non-personally identifiable information, such as anonymized or aggregated information, with suppliers for purposes such as analysis, identifying trends in the areas of our products and to help research and develop new HighLevel Services.
HighLevel does not sell any of your Personal Information for monetary compensation.
6. Information From Children
We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Information from children under 16.  If we learn that we have collected the Personal Information of a child under 16—or the equivalent minimum age depending on the jurisdiction, such as 13 in the United States per the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act—we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.  If you are under 16, do not provide any Information about yourself to HighLevel, including your name, address, telephone number or email address. If you become aware that Information of a child under 16 years of age has been provided, please use one of the methods provided under the “
HOW TO CONTACT US
” section below.
7. Links to Other Websites and Services
We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Platform, including the information or content contained therein.  This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the policies and practices of third parties or other organizations that are not operating on HighLevel’s behalf, including policies and practices related to privacy and security, data collection, processing, use, storage, and disclosure.  This includes: (a) any third party operating any site or service to which the Platform links – the inclusion of a link on the Platform does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates; or (b) any app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer (such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, etc.) - including any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Platform or other HighLevel Services.
8. Do Not Track
Some browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (“DNT”) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not want to be tracked.  At this time, the Platform does not respond to DNT signals.
9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
HighLevel respects your rights in how your Personal Information is used and shared. Depending on where you live, you may have rights to request access or corrections to your personal data and make choices about the kinds of marketing materials you receive (or choose not to receive marketing from HighLevel at all). See below for more information, depending on your location.
10. European Privacy Rights
If you are in Europe, you may have additional rights under the GDPR, the UK GDPR, or nFADP.  Additional choices and rights may be available to you depending on which HighLevel Services you use.
Access, Correction to or Deletion of Your Information.
If you would like to correct or update your Personal Information, or to request access to or deletion of your Personal Information, you may contact us by visiting the Platform or by using the contact details provided under the “
HOW TO CONTACT US
” section below.  If you request a change to or deletion of your Personal Information, please note that we may still need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). Some of your information may also remain within our systems and other records where necessary for compliance with applicable law.
At your request and where the law requires us to do so, we will confirm what Personal Information we hold about you.  You may also have a legal right to obtain a copy of your Personal Information.  You can make such a request by making a written request in one of the ways described in the “HOW TO CONTACT US” section below.  We may charge a processing fee for this service where permitted by law and we will require evidence of your identity before fulfilling your request.
Data Privacy Rights Specific to Individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland.
You can object to processing of your Personal Information, ask us to restrict processing of your Personal Information, or request portability of your Personal Information.  You can exercise these rights by making a written request in one of the ways described in the “
HOW TO CONTACT US
” section below.
Similarly, if we have collected your Personal Information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect (1) the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, or (2) processing your Personal Information under other legal bases.
