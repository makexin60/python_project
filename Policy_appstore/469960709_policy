B. Information You Provide When Playing Online
ⓘ When you play online, we may collect information about your gaming profile, your gameplay, or your use of social features.

Section 2(D): Anti-Cheat, Inappropriate Content, and Fraud Prevention Technologies
. Please make sure your privacy settings and choices in the features you use reflect your preferences.
When you play our online games, your in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics are collected and some may be visible in-game, as well as visible to players outside the game in other EA Services, such as RaceNet. In some of our titles, we may record your gameplay and replay it to other players in-game and/or make it visible to other players outside the game in other EA Services. Leaderboards may also be available to view by other players outside the game in other EA Services. In competitive game modes, we may record your gameplay, and your controller button inputs, and replay these together with your in-game profile information and game statistics to other players in-game and at live EA or partner events.
C. Other Information We Collect When You Use Our Services
ⓘ We may collect other information when you use our Services, such as information about your device, hardware and software information, IP address, or browser information.

D. Information Provided to Us by Third Parties
ⓘ We may receive information about you from third parties, such as Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Google, mobile platforms, or third-party authenticators that you use to sign in to our Services.
We may receive information about you contained in third-party user accounts when you use EA online Services on or through third-party gaming platforms, such as those listed below. This information is provided to EA as part of establishing or linking an EA Account, which is necessary to access EA’s online services. We may also receive information from the third-party gaming platforms that you use for the purpose of delivering or analyzing the performance of EA marketing. Your use of EA online Services through these third parties indicates your agreement for the transfer of this information. Examples of information we receive when creating EA Accounts for our recently released titles are provided below. We never receive your credit card number or other financial information from these third parties as part of establishing or linking an EA Account.
PlayStation®3 system, PlayStation®4 system, & PlayStation®5 console.
Sony provides information from your account for PlayStation™Network such as your Online ID, email address, country, language, friend list, date of birth, and certain preferences.

When you use third-party social gaming platforms (such as Discord or Twitch) and link your EA Account, we may receive information associated with your account on those platforms. Please review the notices presented to you when linking your accounts for details on the information EA receives.
Mobile Platforms.
If you play or purchase our games on your mobile device or tablet, we receive information about you from the app stores and other mobile platform providers. This information may include your username or device ID and the fact that you made a purchase, as applicable, but does not include any financial information. Some of our mobile platforms may send information to us that you authorize them to provide. Our mobile games also may request additional personal information from you, such as push notification tokens or contact list, however, we will collect this information only if you provide us with permission.
Other Third Parties
We may receive information from other third parties, like Facebook or Apple Game Center, when you use these services with our games. We may also receive information about you when other players choose to share their contact lists with us or from publicly-available websites.
E. Legal Basis for Processing
ⓘ Depending on where you reside, we may rely on different legal bases to process your information.
Our legal basis for processing your personal information varies depending on the type of information we collect, the context in which we collect it, as well as on your country of residence, as indicated when you are setting up your EA Account or, when not signed into an EA Account, your location as determined by your IP address and/or your device registration country.
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or of a jurisdiction where similar legal requirements may apply such as Brazil, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, we rely on a number of legal bases to process information about you. We will process information about you where we have your consent, where we have a legitimate interest to do so, where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, and/or where we have a legal obligation to process your information. For example, we typically rely on:
consent when placing cookies on your device on the web (through our cookie consent manager), to send you email marketing, or to deliver third-party targeted advertising to you on our Services;
our legitimate interests to process your information when providing you with customer service support, to serve targeted EA marketing of our Services, or for fraud prevention and security purposes; and
on contractual necessity to process information when you create an EA Account or otherwise use our Services to enable us to provide you with our Services.
If you are a resident in a territory where our legitimate interests mentioned above are not recognized as a lawful basis under applicable law, we will identify and use other appropriate lawful bases to process your personal information such as contractual necessity or your consent.
2. How We Collect Your Information
ⓘ We use various technologies to deliver and measure the effectiveness of our Services, to serve advertisements, and to enhance your player experience. These technologies include cookies and similar technologies, as well as analytics, advertising, anti-cheat, and anti-fraud technologies.
We and third parties use technologies described below to collect information to deliver our Services.
A. Cookies and Similar Technologies
Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We and our third-party partners use cookies and similar tracking technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features, or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, and otherwise enhance your experience. Please refer to
Section 8: Your Choices and Controls
for information on how to manage your cookie preferences.
We may use tracking pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our Services and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our Services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud, and enforce our User Agreement.
We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat, and Anti-Fraud technologies in our Services. These technologies may utilize the same cookies or similar mechanisms as further described below.
B. Analytics Technologies
We use internal and third-party analytics technologies to collect information about how you use our Services, your computer or device and the health of our Services.
For instance, we may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our Services. This information includes technical and related information about your computer, device, and operating and/or network systems (such as IP Address and device identifiers); information about your engagement with certain features and services; gameplay and usage statistics; as well as system interactions and peripheral hardware. We may also collect and store data from your device to create probabilistic identifiers for the purposes of analyzing the services accessed by our players across devices. If you play a game offline without connecting to the Internet, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to us when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online Services, we may also collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display your personal and/or statistical data regarding your game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.
Third-party analytics technologies integrated into our Services may (including SDK [Software Development Kit] and API [Application Program Interface] integrations) combine the information they collect in connection with your use of EA's Services with information they have independently collected over time and/or across different platforms. Many of these companies collect and use information pursuant to their own privacy policies. A list of third-party analytics companies that operate in our Services as well as how to opt-out to the extent applicable can be found at
privacyappendix.ea.com
.
C. Ad Serving Technologies
Some of our Services employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, SDK, API, and other similar technologies to deliver offers and advertising to you within EA Services as well as on third-party platforms and sites, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices to tailor offers and advertising to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or, if you express interest in a game, you may receive an advertisement later for that game or similar Services on EA or third-party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable offers to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.
These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate offers and advertising to you, to measure effectiveness and distribution of these offers and advertising, and to understand how users interact with our Services. In addition to identifiers and certain information listed in
Section 1(C): Other Information We Collect When You Use Our Services
above, this information may include:
Advertisements served and the location of the ad;
Length of time an advertisement was visible;
Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement;
Your interaction, if any, with the ad; and
Advertisement response.
Third-party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an offer to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected over time and/or across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information pursuant to their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks on our Services, their privacy notices, as well as how to opt-out to the extent applicable can be found at
privacyappendix.ea.com
.
To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt-out of third-party targeted advertising, you can also visit
www.networkadvertising.org
,
www.aboutads.info/choices
,
youradchoices.ca
, or
www.youronlinechoices.eu
. Note that opting-out does not mean you won't see ads; rather, it means that the advertising you see may not be as relevant to you.
D. Anti-Cheat, Inappropriate Content, and Fraud Prevention Technologies
We strive to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you use our Services, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, collect data about or from your machine or device, which may include a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, and gather other evidence about your gameplay, machine state, or participation in our Services for fraud prevention, security, cheat detection, and authentication purposes. We may also monitor publicly-available information, third-party sites, and/or use anti-cheat technology within our Services, including automated anti-fraud and abuse algorithms. If you believe your access to our games and/or Services was blocked by this technology in error, please contact us at
EA Help
.
We may also monitor, record, review, and retain voice or text communications, and other user-generated Content (“UGC”, as defined in our
User Agreement
), in our Services for purposes of moderating inappropriate Content that violate our policies (like our
Positive Play Charter
). Moderation includes detecting, investigating and removing inappropriate UGC, as well as potentially sanctioning those players whose activities we find as violating our policies.

4. Who May Receive Your Information
ⓘ We may disclose your personal information to the categories of recipients we describe in this section, such as to provide our Services and to deliver advertisements.
Service providers.
Vendors and other service providers that help us operate our business and provide you with Services may receive your personal information. We require that any service provider processing your personal information only do so on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy, such as the purposes described in
Section 3: How We Use Your Information
.
Business partners.
We may provide personal information to business partners with whom we jointly offer Services. These partners include the companies that provide the platform on which you play our games, such as Sony (PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), or others.
Affiliates and subsidiaries.
We may disclose personal information to other companies in which we have an ownership interest as necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy.
Advertising partners.
Through our Services, we may allow third-party advertising partners to use technologies and other tracking tools to collect information regarding your use of EA's Services and your device (such as your IP address, mobile identifiers, pages visited, location, browser information, time of day). We also may share information relating to your device and your use of our Services with our third-party advertising partners so they may deliver targeted advertisements to you when you visit third-party services and websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising," "online behavioral advertising," or "targeted advertising."
Please refer to
Section 2(C): Ad Serving Technologies
for more detail regarding online advertising, as well as
Section 8: Your Choices and Controls
regarding your relevant choices and controls.
Disclosures to protect us or others.
We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity. In particular, if we receive a report that you have violated our policies (like our
Positive Play Charter
), we may disclose that report and other relevant information to the platform on which you play our games.
Disclosure in the event of merger, sale, or other asset transfer.
In the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale, or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law or contract.
Third-party plugins.
When third-party technologies or social tools are integrated into our Services, those third parties may collect information about your use of our Services. An example is the Facebook "Like" button.
In certain instances (such as on our websites), our Services incorporate YouTube videos and use YouTube API Services. This integration is subject to the
YouTube Terms of Service
, and may result in the collection of your personal information by Google according to the
Google Privacy Policy
. If you have authorized us to receive your YouTube or other Google information, such as through logging in to our Services through your Google Account, you may manage your authorization (including revocation) through the
Google Security Settings
. You may also have other rights with respect to your personal information that we have collected, as described in
Section 8: Your Choices and Controls
.
Cross-platform sharing.
Some of our games allow you to connect and play with friends and members of a game's community, regardless of what platform they play on. For example, someone on an Xbox could join a match with a player who is using a PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console. We call this ability to match players across platforms "Cross-Play." When Cross-Play is enabled and you play with someone on another platform, that other platform may receive your platform's ID (such as Xbox Gamertag, or Online ID of your account for PlayStation™Network) along with other information necessary to enable Cross-Play. In addition, we may provide information regarding your use of Cross-Play features to the platform on which you play our games. You can change your Cross-Play preferences by visiting the game's or your platform's settings menus.
Some of our games may also allow you to continue progress on a game between platforms, as well as enable the ability for your purchases on one platform to be available on another platform. We will share your information with platforms to the extent necessary to enable these features.
Other platforms receiving your information may include Sony (PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch), Valve (Steam), Epic, and additional platforms as they become available for these features. Your information received by these platforms may be subject to their respective privacy notices.
With your consent.
We may disclose your information to other recipients with your express consent, unless otherwise described above. For example, you may agree to us sharing your information with a certain company or organization to hear about their products, services, or promotions, or if you tell us that you want to link your EA Account with another company’s services. These recipients will process the information you agree to share according to their respective privacy notices.
5. Where We Hold Your Information
ⓘ We store and process your information in the United States and other countries where we operate. When we do this, we utilize technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to meet data transfer requirements set by various privacy laws, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation.
When you access EA Services, including when available on third-party platforms, your personal information is generally collected by EA directly and processed in the United States. Personal information we collect may be subsequently stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy and Cookie Policy in the United States or any other country in which EA, its subsidiaries, or third-party agents operate. By consenting to the transfer of your personal data outside of your country of residence, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.
EA's privacy practices comply with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Cross-Border Privacy Rules System (APEC CBPR). The APEC CBPR System provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework is available here:

EA Inc. US has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. EA Inc. US has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
. The EA Inc. US entities subject to the DPF Principles are available
here
.
EA Inc. US is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. EA Inc. US complies with the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, UK, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over EA Inc. US’ compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. In certain situations, EA Inc. US may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, EA Inc. US commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of TrustArc are provided at no cost to you.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Data Privacy Framework
website
, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
6. How We Protect Your Information
ⓘ We use a range of security measures to secure and protect your information.
Security of your information is a priority at EA and we take a range of technical and organizational measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive information. Even so, please be aware that no security measure is perfect. Thus we cannot guarantee the security of your information at all times. You should always be diligent when it comes to the protection of your personal information. Learn more about
EA Security
.
7. Children
ⓘ We strive to provide age-appropriate experiences for children. Depending on the age of the child accessing our online Services, parents or guardians may need to provide permission to enable their child to access certain online features of our Services.
Although the majority of EA Services are intended for adults, EA recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of children who may access our Services online. We strive to ensure that children who access our Services receive age-appropriate experiences by employing data minimization, privacy by design, and default practices. We consider the best interests of children when determining the age-appropriate experience they receive and take into account the developmental maturity of children of different ages. When children reach the age of majority in their country or territory, they may receive the adult experience.
When players identify themselves as being children under the minimum age of digital consent guidelines set by the law of individual countries or territories, we will:
(1) obtain consent from parents for the use of their children's personal information, when required by applicable law. For example, we allow parents to create a child EA Account on certain Services, and with parental consent EA will collect and use certain children’s personal information to manage a child EA Account;
(2) disable features in certain Services that could allow a child to share information that directly identifies them, unless a parent has provided relevant consent to us or the third-party platform on which their child is playing. For example, we will respect third-party (console) parental controls as they apply to game features that could allow a child to provide personal information in online or multiplayer games (such as through chat or user generated content);
(3) collect and use certain information for limited purposes only. For example, we may send local in-app notifications, which do not rely on collecting personal information. Also, persistent device identifiers like IP address or advertising device identifier may be collected to support our internal operations, such as:
Delivering the Services;
Maintaining or analyzing the functionality of the Service;
Serving contextual ads or frequency capping;
Protecting the security or integrity of the user of Service; or
Legal or regulatory compliance;
(4) not condition a child's participation in an activity (such as gaming contests) on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. With certain Service-related activities, we may not permit children to participate at all, even if we have consent; and
(5) offer parental controls and choices. If you are a parent or guardian and wish to revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your child or have that information deleted, please contact us via the options in
Section 12: Contact Us
. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child's account and/or revert them to the age-appropriate experience, as applicable.
If we make material changes to how we collect, use, share or otherwise process your child's personal information, we will notify parents as required by applicable law.
We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and the risks of disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review the privacy settings applicable to their use of our Services, a summary of which is available on our
Player and Parental Tools page
.
8. Your Choices and Controls
ⓘ We provide you with choice and control about our use of your information, including your ability to exercise your data privacy rights.
We give you meaningful choices when it comes to our collection and use of your information. For example, if you no longer want to receive marketing emails from EA, you may click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of any marketing email we send.
You can learn how to exercise any of your privacy rights by visiting our
My Privacy Rights
portal.
We offer the rights below as provided by applicable law in the countries and jurisdictions in which we offer our Services. These laws include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, and state privacy laws enacted in the United States. While we provide additional details where necessary to comply with jurisdiction-specific legal requirements, such as in our section on
Information for California Residents
, these details are illustrative and not intended to limit similar rights that may be available elsewhere.
You may appeal our decision regarding your privacy rights. To do so, please visit our
My Privacy Rights
portal and click on "Other privacy enquiries".
Verification of account ownership.
To protect your account security and personal information, you may be asked to verify your account ownership prior to us processing your request to exercise your data privacy rights. Verification methods include being logged into your EA Account, confirming ownership and access to the email address associated with your account, and/or confirming other unique account details.
Authorized agents.
You can use an authorized agent to make a request to exercise your data privacy rights. Please contact us at
EA Help
to initiate that request. If you use an authorized agent to exercise your right to deletion, access, or correction, we will require that you verify your account ownership directly with us, unless you have provided your agent with a valid power of attorney consistent with California law that includes a comparable proof of account ownership.
If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information for targeted marketing purposes, we will require your signed permission demonstrating that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf.
Your right to deletion.
You may deactivate your EA Account or delete the personal information associated with your account by contacting us at
EA Help
. If you do so, you will no longer have access to the EA games or Services associated with your account. Note that EA may retain information needed to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreements, protect our legal rights, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our Services. Otherwise, we will retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide you with, create, and improve our Services, and to comply with the law.
Your right to access (or "know").
You can access the personal information we hold about you, including the categories of personal information collected, where we collect it from, why and how we use it, and who may receive this information (including to whom it may be sold or shared, as those terms are defined under applicable law).

You can request correction of your personal information where it is inaccurate. In some cases, we may provide self-service tools, such as those on the
EA Account customer portal
, that enable you to update some of your personal information.
Your right to opt-out or object to certain processing.
You may opt-out of targeted advertising, or object to processing of your data based on our legitimate interests, where applicable law provides for such rights. This right is also referred to as the ability to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, as specifically provided by applicable US state privacy laws. To exercise these rights, please see further instructions in our
My Privacy Rights
portal, including the Targeted Advertising Provided by Third Parties section.
Cookie Controls.
If you are in a location whose laws may require additional choices, you can control cookies and similar technologies used on most EA sites for certain optional functional and advertising analytics and targeted advertising purposes via the banner that appears at the bottom of the webpage during your first visit. You can also disable some cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.
The effect of your choice will depend on the context in which you exercise it:
If you opt-out of having your information shared for purposes of targeted advertising on PC and console through your EA Account, your choice will take effect for any PC and console games that you have logged into with your EA Account.
If you opt-out of having your information shared for purposes of targeted advertising through one of our mobile game settings, your choice will take effect for that mobile game.
If you opt-out of having your information shared for purposes of web targeted advertising through our cookies controls, your choice will take effect when visiting our websites through the browser and device on which you made that choice.
Global Privacy Control.
In certain regions, we recognize an opt-out preference signal sent by your web browser (sometimes referred to as the Global Privacy Control or "GPC") as a valid request to opt-out of the sale and sharing of the personal information processed via the browser you are using. In practice this controls whether your browser loads third-party cookies on our Services' websites that are used for targeted advertising, or may otherwise be considered a sale or sharing of personal information. We process this signal only based on browser settings, so you would need to set them separately for different browsers on the same device and across devices. Please review the
list of browsers that support GPC and associated instructions
on how to enable it. GPC does not control targeted advertising in our PC, console, or mobile games and must be changed via your account or the game's settings, as described above.
You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of these privacy rights.
9. Third-Party Services
ⓘ Our websites and Services may contain ads or links to third-party services and sites.
Our websites and Services may contain advertising or links to third-party services (such as the Facebook "Like" button or links to third-party websites). If you click on those links, including an advertisement, you will leave the EA Service and go to the third-party service or site that you selected. If you visit a third-party website or use a third-party service, you should consult that service's or site's privacy policy as your use of third-party sites or services is governed by their privacy policies.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data

, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
