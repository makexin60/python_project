Cloud SIM is Moving to Call.com!
An agreement was made between Cloud SIM Telecom Limited and Call.com
                        Telecom Limited. As a part of this agreement we will transfer Cloud SIM customers to the new
                        Call.com service.
The team behind Call.com has been hosting the Cloud SIM service for
                        8 years, so your account remains in good hands.
Transfer your account
When you move, your Cloud SIM virtual phone numbers and credit balance will be transferred to
                        your new Call.com account with immediate access when you download the app.
