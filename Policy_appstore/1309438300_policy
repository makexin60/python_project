“

” refers to parkrun Global Limited. A UK based charity registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, (
charity number 1175062
) and with Companies House (

). Registered office at Frameworks, 2 Sheen Road, Richmond, Middlesex, England, TW9 1AE.
parkruns are volunteer and community led 5k and 2k events that take place every weekend, at locations all around the world, where people of all abilities, and backgrounds, are able to participate for free by walking, jogging, running, or volunteering.
Our events are socially-focussed and community-led, with an emphasis on regular participation rather than performance, and
our mission
is
to transform health & happiness by empowering people to come together, to be active, social & outdoors.
We are committed to respecting and protecting your personal data and online privacy. This includes your right to know what we do with the personal information you share with us. It also guides our policies regarding the management of your data, including how the information is collected, how it is processed and for what purposes.
It is important to us that we communicate our policies and procedures with you clearly and in a manner that provides clarity to all participants who have registered with parkrun and those who have used our other services, for example a parkrun shop and/or donation platforms.
parkrun Global collects, manages, and processes all associated data and is therefore considered the data controller for all parkrun group companies and all parkrun events worldwide.

3 - Why we need your data
In order to support our global network of parkrun events it is critical we understand who is participating so we request specific information be provided as part of the registration process. We then use this data for multiple purposes from providing participants with information about their participation through to more complex challenges including measuring the impact of our events within different communities by monitoring physical activity levels and social engagement.
The UK GDPR and DPA require that all information collected must be done so under a specific lawful basis. There are
six clearly defined lawful bases for processing personal information
and we categorises the majority of our data processing under three of these:
Contract
Legitimate interests
Consent
3.1 Contract
Our registration Terms and Conditions confirm the information required for us to provide you with a “parkrun ID” to allow us to provide you with accurate records of your parkrun participation history and details of your milestones.
This lawful basis also includes any administrative or service-related emails, for example, to confirm that you have registered with us or taken part in one of our events, or to alert you of an update to this Privacy Policy or other policies that are relevant to you.
These therefore do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the services you requested. We require this information in order to provide you with records of your participation.
3.2 Legitimate Interests
Outside of your direct participation we also wish to develop the reach and impact of our events and as such have a legitimate interest to process certain information with this aim. This includes carrying-out research to further understand who is or isn’t participating in our events (in order to understand our ability to impact those most in need) or capturing and sharing images of our events taking place, helping us to inspire other people to engage in physical activity and redefine what it means to be active.
We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
3.3 Consent
Above and beyond simple participation as a walker, runner, or volunteer, there are a number of ways you can help us to ensure our events positively impact the health and happiness of their local communities, and remain free to participate in.
One of the best ways to support us in this way is by consenting to receive emails regarding event profiles, offers, competitions and emails from our partners, training tips, and more. We therefore provide the opportunity at registration, and via your profile, to opt in to these communications. You can opt out at any time.
Due to UK GDPR requirements for providing consent, we do not process any data on children under the age of 13 if it would require consent as the lawful reason for processing. For this reason, children under the age of 13 do not have the option to opt in to the above emails.
3.4 Other Lawful Bases
There may be occasions where we are required to process information under one of the other three lawful bases:
Legal Obligation - for example, this is where we are required to process data to comply with law
Vital Interest - for example, if we are required to use an individual's data to assist with emergency medical care but they are unable to provide consent
Public Task - for example, if we are required to carry out a specific task in the public interest which is laid out in law
4 - Categories of data
We utilise the following definitions for the types of data we collect:
4.1 Profile & Identity
For an individual registered with parkrun we utilise profile login information including password, parkrun ID, participation instances (walking, jogging, running and/or volunteering), date of birth, self identified gender, full name, postcode (not used for purposes of contact), marketing preferences, third party linking information and emergency contact (ICE) including your chosen point of contacts name and contact phone number.
Individuals who use the parkrun donation platforms will be required to provide additional personal information. Please refer to Section 5.6 for more information.
4.2 Contact
For an individual registered with parkrun we utilise email address, mobile phone number (SMS results service).
Individuals who use the parkrun donation platforms may be required to provide additional personal information. Please refer to Section 5.5 for more information.

4.4 Incidents

Additional information may be added by staff to these reports as part of the process of following up on the incidents.
5.10 Cookies
When you visit our websites, cookies will be stored on your computer. Generally, cookies and similar technologies work by assigning to your browser or device a unique number that has no meaning outside of parkrun. We use these technologies to personalise your experience and to assist in delivering content specific to your interests. Additionally, after you’ve entered your parkrun ID and password we save that information so you don’t have to re-enter it repeatedly. Most browsers automatically accept cookies.
Some third-party services we use, such as Google Analytics, may place cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by parkrun only, and not the use of cookies by third parties.
To manage the collection of information through cookies or other equivalent technology you can use the settings on your browser or mobile device.
5.11 Log Files
The collection of information: Every time you connect to parkrun websites your IP (Internet Protocol) address registers on our servers. Your IP address reveals no information other than the number assigned to you.
We do not use this technology to obtain any personal data against your knowledge or free will (i.e. automatically recording email addresses of visitors). Nor do we use it for any purpose other than to help us monitor traffic on our website, or (in case of criminal activity or misuse of our information) to cooperate with law enforcement.
5.12 Web Beacons
These are small pieces of code that deliver a graphic image on a web page or in an email for the purpose of transferring data back to us. The information collected via this process will include information such as IP Address, as well as information about how you respond to an email campaign (e.g. at what time the email was opened, which links you click on in the email, etc.).
We may use web beacons on our websites or include them in e-mails that we send to you. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising, email auditing and reporting, and personalisation.
In some cases we allow our partners to include web beacons in emails served by us on their behalf. In these instances they are only able to collect anonymous data and have no access to personal information.
5.13 Local Volunteer Event Teams
In order to support our local event teams’ requirement to manage their volunteers, process results, and record incidents, we created a dedicated online system. This enables event teams to carry out their roles with regards to the safe and appropriate management of their events, without the need for them to hold or have access to sensitive personal data of their participants. For example, they are able to email their volunteers through our online results processing platform without being able to see individual email addresses.
It is important to note however that due to the nature of our events, friendships form and as a result event teams are likely to also communicate directly with each other through platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, SMS or email.
5.14 Social Media
When you engage with parkrun over social media, it will usually be as a registered user of that social media platform. The use of personal data on social media is governed by your agreement with that platform’s own privacy policy or terms and conditions. parkrun official social media pages are administered by parkrun as a data controller of these pages.
These social media platforms may process user personal data to deliver anonymised user statistics to the local administrator of that page or event. We do not use the personal data you have made available on social media outside of that platform, unless you have given us your consent to do so.
5.15 Event Photography and Filming
Photography or filming is likely to take place at our events, is common practice, and helps us to inspire other people to engage in physical activity and to redefine what it means to be active. It also provides a means for historical recording of our events over time. Furthermore, our use of images helps to demonstrate diverse groups of people engaging in and enjoying physical activity both during parkrun events but also as part of the wider community.
We ensure compliance with safeguarding laws and are supported both in-house through our Safeguarding Lead and externally with the support of other experts in the field of safeguarding. Further details of our Photography Policy are published
here
.
Individuals can submit their own stories, information and/or photos directly to parkrun via our ‘
Feedback from the Field
’ form. Information submitted is stored in line with this Privacy Policy and this is clearly stated on the form, along with the individual's rights in regards to that information.

The AWRC also manages the
parkrun Research Board
, a group of independent academics who review incoming requests for health and wellbeing research and advise parkrun to either approve or reject. Approved research requests may receive anonymised and published data directly from parkrun.
All research carried out by the AWRC or approved third parties is required to have ethical approval from an independent research ethics board.

We do not share our user’s personal contact details with any third parties except as required by law. All communications sent to our database on behalf of our partners are sent directly by us and only where you have consented for us to do so.

As part of parkrun’s commitment to the safety to its volunteers and community, if requested to do so by Authorities in charge of Contact Tracing in the country you are based, and unless there is a compelling reason not to, parkrun will provide them with details of those people who attended the parkrun event in question if the data is available under the lawful basis of Public Task.
parkrun will share this information as it is in the interests of public health under the lawful basis of Public task. The information that would be shared will be as required by the relevant Authority who may use this information to contact you.
In line with parkrun’s data protection obligations, all requests for disclosure of data will be assessed to ensure that such disclosure is necessary and proportionate.

7 - How we contact you
The large majority of our outgoing communication, to the parkrun community, is via email. Sending an email to you is a form of data processing, and as such may only be carried out under a specific lawful basis.
7.1 Under the Lawful Basis of Fulfilling a Contract
In order to fulfil our obligation to you as a registered parkrunner, to ensure our events are delivered in a safe and appropriate manner, and to ensure the parkrun organisation is managed appropriately, there are some communications we send to everyone.
The following communications are not an exhaustive list, but fall into this category:
Confirmation you have registered with us.
Updates to key documents, such as this Privacy Policy.
Confirmation that your participation (walking, running, or volunteering) has been recorded by the local event team.
Notification that you have joined a parkrun milestone club and are eligible to claim any associated items such as t-shirts, wristbands, or certificates.
For those who have volunteered at a parkrun event, a regular volunteer update.
For those who have signed up to volunteer at a specific parkrun event, emails from that event team relating to that volunteering situation.
As per Section 5.5 if you have registered to make donations via the parkrun Donations Platform we will also contact you under the lawful basis of fulfilling a contract to:
Confirm receipt of donation(s)
Any additional communication in relation to your specific donations to this platform
7.2 Under the Lawful Basis of Legitimate Interest
There are some occasions where we may contact you as part of our vision to make the world healthier and happier. For example, where we write to people who’ve registered but not participated, with the aim of understanding why and then being able to create a more supportive environment.
The following types of communications are not an exhaustive list, but fall into this category:
Surveys aimed at developing our understanding of who is participating
Surveys for research aimed at understanding the effect of parkrun on global health and wellbeing
Local event teams directly contact specific parkrunners using the online results processing platform.
You have a right to object to receiving these emails, to do that please
contact parkrun Support
directly.
7.3 Under the Lawful Basis of Consent
Individual parkrunners can also opt in to receive local volunteer appeals from the events of their choice. Consent can be withdrawn at any time via your parkrun profile.
As per Section 5.5 if you have registered to make donations via the
parkrun Donation Platform
we can also contact you under the lawful basis of consent to help support parkrun.
8 - How we protect your information
We work extremely hard to apply appropriate security measures in order to protect your data from being accessed or disclosed without your permission, or lost. We have a relatively small staff team, who are regularly updated on good practice in data handling, all personal data is password protected and only available to those with a specific need for access.
In the event of a data breach we will notify you and any applicable regulator, where legally required to do so.
At the local event level we ask our teams to support all participants (walkers, runners, and volunteers) using our online results processing platform and their official email account (which we maintain control of centrally). As such, the only personal information event teams hold on their participants is an email address if an email has previously been sent to the event email account. All event-team email accounts are password protected.
Whilst we understand that event teams will also hold files that include parkrun ID barcode numbers of specific participants, this is publicly available information. Should a parkrunner request that their data be deleted from our servers, these barcode numbers will no longer be able to identify specific individuals.
Some event teams also use Facebook to communicate with participants, in these cases we retain administrative control centrally and are able to control/remove access when required.
8.1 Third Country Data Transfers
parkrun Global is responsible for managing your personal data within the Group.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. For example, we use a cloud-based server AWS storage and computer services based in Ireland.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK. These third parties are selected only if they exist in a territory deemed compliant with relevant legislation (

10 - Automated decision making and Profiling
In some situations we make automated decisions based on various types of data that we hold, this is known as profiling. Examples of where we use this might be to send research surveys to people who have only ever participated once or to market products to specific demographics of people.
Whilst our automated decision making processes do not have a legal or similarly significant effect on the individuals concerned, you do have the right to object to us applying these processes to your data.

We keep this Policy under regular review and place updates on JustGiving.com. We will also provide notifications of material changes via email or other channels. If you keep using the Services after we notify you, you consent to the updated Privacy Policy. If not, you may cancel your account.
What Are Your Rights?
JustGiving recognises that your personal data belongs to you and we don’t wish to use it in ways that you don’t want us to.
You can control whether or not you receive marketing email from JustGiving by visiting the Notifications Centre in your Account.
If granted by applicable laws, you can also exercise a variety of rights regarding our use of your data:
You can ask us for a copy of the information we have about you
You can ask us to correct any incorrect data we have about you and you can also update your account details yourself at any time by visiting your JustGiving account
You can ask us to delete your data
You can ask for your data in a common, machine-readable format · You can object to any processing we do on the basis of
legitimate interests
or to any
automated decision-making
You can ask us to restrict the processing of your data
To exercise any of the foregoing rights, click
here.
Note that some of these rights may not be enforceable in your jurisdiction and some aren’t absolute—for example, we may not be able to forget you if we have to keep some of your data to comply with the law—but we’ll evaluate your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. JustGiving will respond to your request within one month of receiving it. Also, note that if you’re located in the UK or the EU, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or the supervisory authority in your country of residence or place of work.
What Data Do We Collect?
We don’t receive any personal data about you other than what you provide us, either by creating an account, using the Services, from Facebook when you agree to connect your Facebook account to JustGiving, or data we can infer from your use of the Services.
When you create a JustGiving account:
We will collect basic contact information about you to set up your account you so you can make donations or raise funds. This will include your name, address and email address. We will also ask you to register a username and password so you can gain secure access to your account in the future.
Alternatively, you may authorise us to collect your basic personal details from a secure online source (e.g. Google, Facebook, PayPal or a sponsor charity) to which you have already provided this information.
We enable you to set an image for your JustGiving profile and this image is shown as a thumbnail next to all of your actions on the platform, unless you have chosen to hide your name and photo from the public when you donate. Please note that this image is dynamic and not frozen in time—e.g. if you change your image in 2018, the new image will appear next to your activities from 2015.
When you sign in to JustGiving using your Facebook account:
If you choose to login via Facebook, we will obtain access to your Facebook public profile information and email address. We will use this information to allow you to login and populate our records about you. If you give us permission (via Facebook’s preference settings), we may also obtain access to your friend list but we only receive the names of your friends who are also JustGiving users. We will only use this to see if people on your friends list are also using our website and as set out in
How we use personal information
below. You can control whether or not Facebook shares this data with us, either by changing your preferences when you first login to JustGiving with your Facebook account or by visiting the app setting controls on Facebook’s platform.
When you make a donation:
To enable us to process donations, we will collect basic payment information as well as your name, home address and email address. Your name and the amount you’ve donated will display on the public page, unless you select the “Hide my name and photo from public view” option when you donate. As well as hiding your details from the public when you donate, you can also change the display name to something else, such as a nickname or your initials.
When you create a Fundraising or Crowdfunding Page:
We will use the details you provided when you set up your account to create your Fundraising Page or JustGiving Crowdfunding Page. We will also collect details of the charity or not-for-profit that you are supporting, or the details for your proposed Crowdfunding Page. Where applicable, we will ask you to provide details of how and when you are intending to fundraise and/or the occasion you are recognising by carrying out the fundraising.
Where you create a Crowdfunding Page, we will also collect your title (if you choose to provide it), date of birth, telephone number and personal bank account details.
When you give us information about others
: You may decide to provide us with information about others (or authorise us to collect this information on your behalf from your social networks or your email contacts list) for example:
so we can help you tell your friends and family about a Crowdfunding Page you are running or charity fundraising you are carrying out; or
if you start fundraising or crowdfunding for, or in the memory or in celebration of, another person
You must ensure that they have agreed to you providing us with their information. Where required by local laws, we would advise you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a copy of, or link to, this Policy. This is especially the case if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a reference to an illness or health condition).
You should also only contact individuals using the Services who you know would be happy to hear from you and must not use our Services to send unsolicited ‘spam’ messages.
If you create a Crowdfunding Page for a club, organisation, body or association which is managed by someone other than yourself, you must ensure that the manager(s) of that club, organisation etc. agrees to your fundraising (e.g. you are a member of a sports club and want to raise funds for a new clubhouse – you must seek the agreement of the sports club committee).
When you register your interest to hear about Charity Places for Events
: We collect personal information when you register your interest to be informed about Charity Places for an Event. This will include information such as your name and email address.
When you apply for a Charity Place
: We collect personal information when you apply for a Charity Place for an Event. This will include your name, email address and any additional questions which help the charity to review your application.
When you use the Services
: We also collect information about your use of our Services, including your IP address, mobile device identifier, how much time you spend on the site, and what you do, like or view. We do this through the use of cookies. To read more about our use of cookies, please refer to our separate
Cookies
page.
What Happens If You Don’t Want Us to Have Your Data?
You are not required to provide personal data to us. Note, however, that your failure to do so may affect our ability to provide the Services you request. For example, we are unable to process your donation to a fundraiser if you do not provide your payment information.
How Do We Use Your Data?
JustGiving uses your personal data to provide the services you request, to personalise your JustGiving experience, to send you communications and to enhance your ability to raise funds for the causes you care about. We also use your data to help us make JustGiving better and to advertise to you.

We use your information to provide our Services to you:
using your account data to enable you to take advantage of our platform’s features, like setting up a Fundraising or Crowdfunding Page
processing donations and claiming Gift Aid, if applicable
where you set up a Crowdfunding Page, to carry out bank account verification and identity checking, including with a credit reference agency
Personalising your JustGiving:
We want to enhance your experience with JustGiving by tailoring the site to your interests:
When you “like” a cause or type of cause, we use that information to suggest causes you may be interested in and show them to you on the home Feed
In your Feed, we’ll also show you actions taken by people in your giving network—Facebook friends (if you’ve linked your account to JustGiving) who are also JustGiving users and people to whose Fundraising/Crowdfunding Pages you have donated
In your Feed and elsewhere in the Services, we’ll show you causes related to causes you have fundraised for or donated to in the past
Communications:
We use your information to send you some different types of emails and you can stop receiving them as set forth below:

Enhancing Your Ability to Raise Funds:
We offer you a variety of ways to enhance your fundraising/crowdfunding abilities, such as:
allowing you to share others’ pages or your donation to a page with your connections by email, to other JustGiving users or through your social networks, like Facebook or Twitter
when you create or update a page, allowing you to share that news with your giving network by email, to other JustGiving users or through your social networks
Making JustGiving Better:
We use aggregated and personal data about you and your use of our Services to develop and test better fundraising tools, to drive our research and development and to better understand our users and charity partners. JustGiving does this analysis using a variety of data sources—transactional data (how you use the Services), click stream and log data (web traffic and Services usage), email data (how you respond to emails we send you), survey data, customer service data and data you agree to share with us from your Facebook account. We may send you surveys about the Services, but you can
opt out of receiving these
and participation is completely voluntary.
Advertising:
Aside from sending marketing communications by email, we may target ads to our users and measure how they perform, both through our Services, such as on justgiving.com, and through other channels like social networking sites and other websites.
With Whom Are We Sharing Your Data?
We may disclose your data to our affiliated organisations and subsidiaries, and to service providers who render services to us or you on our behalf. We also may disclose your information if required by law, requested by law enforcement authorities or to enforce our legal rights, such as pursuant to a subpoena or to HMRC when you claim Gift Aid. We may share your information in connection with a sale or reorganisation of JustGiving, but in any such case, the terms of this Policy will continue to apply.
Our service providers include:
banks and payment providers – to authorise and complete payment transactions;
in relation to creators of Crowdfunding Pages, third party identity checking or credit reference agencies – for the purposes of identity checking and bank account verification;
organisations within the payment card industry – to help prevent online fraud;
IT, information security and cloud services providers – to help us provide the Services and keep your data safe;
communication providers – to assist us with the processing and delivery of email and other communications;
behavioural analytics tools, like Kissmetrics – to collect and help us understand data when you use our Services, described in the
How Do We Use Data? Section
.
We also share your personal data with fundraisers, Crowdfunding Page creators, charities and event partners and companies as follows:
Fundraisers and Crowdfunding Page Creators: If you donate to a Fundraising or Crowdfunding Page, we let the page creator know your identity and amount of your donation. You’re also given the option to share your contact details with the page creator for the purposes of them thanking you for your donation.
Charities: We share with charities and not-for-profits who are registered with us details about donations made to them, including your personal data (such as your name, email address and postal address). For donors located in the UK or EU or donating to a charity in the UK or EU we’ll only share your personal details with the beneficiary charity if you opt-in to receive communications from it. Charities and not-for-profits who are registered with JustGiving also have access to data about Fundraising Pages created by our users (including personal data of page creators) so they can understand who is fundraising for their benefit. For more information, please see the section
“How Do Charity Partners Use My Data?”
below. We will also share your personal details with the charity when you apply for a Charity Place for an Event. This is so the charity can contact you about your application and, if successful, can register your details with the Event Organiser so you can attend.
Partners: If you create a Fundraising Page for, donate to, register for, enter or otherwise participate in a sponsored event, campaign, fundraising initiative, promotion or sweepstake, we may share data about such Fundraising Pages, donation activity or registration with sponsoring third-party partners so that they can help to facilitate your participation in an event, campaign, fundraising initiative or promotion or to contact you as permitted by applicable law. The data we share with these partners may include your name, address, email address, donation amount and date, the named beneficiary and creation date of your page, your fundraising target, how much you have raised and the number of donors to your page. Fundraising Page creators, donors and participants located in the UK and EU can opt out of such sharing by contacting us, unless the sharing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you’re a party.
How Do Charity Partners Use My Data?
As stated above we will share your personal data with the charities to which you donate unless you’re in the UK/EU and choose not to share data with those charities or receive email appeals from them. We’ll also share details of Fundraising Page creators with charities on whose behalf you fundraise. When we pass your information to charities, they also become a controller with respect to such personal data. This means that they’re responsible for their own compliance with data protection laws when they use your personal data, and all such use is subject to the charity’s own privacy notice. JustGiving is not responsible for charities’ use of your personal data or the charities’ compliance with applicable laws.
When you donate to or create a Fundraising Page, JustGiving will ask whether or not you consent to receiving email from the charity about the impact of your donation and other ways to support them including future events, campaigns and appeals. We will pass your consent preference on to the charity, if it is subscribed to receive such reporting from us. Note that the charity will need to receive your personal data to send you emails you consent to receive.
If you want to change your preferences for a charity to use your data (to contact you or otherwise), please contact the charity directly.
If the charity you’re interacting with hasn’t subscribed to receive charity reporting from JustGiving, that charity won’t have access to details about your consent preferences. This means that they won’t know if you have opted in or out of receiving email fundraising appeals.
Note that charities receive information about supporters from lots of different sources. We’re not the system of record for our charity partners, so we can only collect and evidence your consent to receive email fundraising appeals from our charity partners as you elect on our platform. We cannot reflect any changes in your consent preferences that you make directly with the charity. For example, if you opt in to receive emails from a charity when you make a donation through JustGiving, but then you subsequently opt out by telling the charity, JustGiving won’t have a record that you opted out of receiving email from that charity.
How Do We Use Personal Data of Our Partner Users?
If you work for a charity or company that has a business relationship with JustGiving, we use your data in slightly different ways than for individual users of the Services.
We collect a business user’s name, work email address, office number and fax number. We use this data to enable you to sign into your business’ account and to access charity reporting. In addition, we may use your data to perform business services you request. Finally, we will send you the following email communications: operational emails, customer service emails and business marketing emails. When you log into your Notifications Centre, you can opt out of receiving emails from us, other than service emails related to your requests.
How Long Do We Keep Your Data?
We keep your personal data in an identifiable form for as long as we have a legitimate reason to use the data and as required by law.
Children’s Data
We do not direct the Services to users under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at
help@justgiving.com
.
JustGiving App
The JustGiving App is part of the Services, so this Policy applies to your use of the App. In addition, there are a few unique terms that apply when you use the App:
Device Access:
You can choose to give us access to resources on your device (e.g. pictures or contact details) via the App permissions and we will only do so until you ask us to stop.
In-App Notifications:
You can amend your preferences on receiving in-App notifications by visiting the Notifications tab within Settings on the App. Note that this does not affect your preferences for receiving emails from JustGiving—for more information about the email we send, please see above.
Cookies and Analytics:
The App does not use cookies but we do use our normal analytics tools within the App that enable us to provide the services you request, identify service issues to us, improve our services and to provide content tailored to users’ personal preferences and profiles.
StreamRaiser™
StreamRaiser™ is part of the Services, so this Policy applies to your use of StreamRaiser™, along with a few additional terms. StreamRaiser™ allows you to collect donations for your favorite cause while you stream on Twitch, by linking a JustGiving Fundraising Page to your Twitch account. Streamers can choose to show StreamRaiser™ overlays on their Twitch streams, such as an alert box, which the streamer can use to notify her audience and thank donors. Note that if you donate to a Fundraising Page whose page creator is using StreamRaiser™ and you do not choose to hide your name and photo from the public, the streamer might elect to thank you or otherwise publicise your donation on her Twitch stream using the StreamRaiser™ overlays. When you use or visit Twitch, also keep in mind that the
Twitch Privacy Policy
applies to your use of their platform.
Users Located in the UK and European Union
In addition to the foregoing, the following provisions apply to our users located in the UK and EU.
On What Legal Bases Do We Process Your Data?
We process your personal data on a variety of legal bases depending on the use. For example, we will only process your personal data to send you direct marketing if we have your consent and you can withdraw this consent at any time by visiting the Notifications Centre and opting out of receiving such emails. Sometimes it is necessary to process your data for us to comply with our legal obligations, like when we send Gift Aid information to HMRC. Please see our separate page on
Legal Bases
for more information.
How Are We Using Your Data Based on Our Legitimate Interests?
We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests, provided that these uses aren’t outweighed by your rights or interests. For any uses we justify on the basis of legitimate interest, you have the right to opt out of such processing
here
. To learn more about our use of data for our legitimate interests, please see our
separate page
.
Claiming Gift Aid
If you choose to claim Gift Aid on a donation made on JustGiving, we will share your taxpayer information and details about your donation with Swiftaid, which provides a service to facilitate filing Gift Aid on this donation and any other eligible donation made by you in the then current tax year. Such data may include your contact details, tokenized payment information, donation amount, recipient and other donation details. If you claim Gift Aid on a donation, an account profile will be created with Swiftaid and you may receive service emails from them. Swiftaid is a third party and uses your personal data in accordance with its own
privacy policy
and
donor terms
. You can edit your account details or close your account with Swiftaid by contacting Swiftaid directly. If you do not wish for us to share your data with Swiftaid, do not elect to claim Gift Aid on your donation. It is necessary for us to share your data with Swiftaid so that we can claim Gift Aid on your behalf, as detailed in the
JustGiving Terms of Service
.
Are We Doing Any Automated Decision Making?
To help our users fundraise more effectively, we employ machine learning and other analytics that make inferences about some characteristics of our users. We use these tools to tailor emails to you, to show and prioritise causes, fundraisers, pages, and users on your Feed we think you’ll be interested in, and make suggestions about how much you may want to fundraise or donate. You can opt out of these processes at any time
here
. To learn more about the automatic decision-making we do, please see our
separate page
.
Where Are We Sending Your Data?
As a global platform, we may store some users’ personal data outside the UK or EU. If we do, we ensure your data is processed only in countries that provide an adequate level of protection for your data or where the recipient provides appropriate safeguards, such as model contract clauses, binding corporate rules, or a certification scheme.
JustGiving has self-certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”). For detailed information about our certification and adherence
to the Data Privacy Framework, please see our Blackbaud Data Privacy Framework Certification Notice at

Please contact us if you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement or in general questions regarding your Personal Data. Your information will be used to provide the Services and in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the relevant PayPal
User Agreement
.
1. Overview
PayPal UK Ltd (“we,” “our,” “us,” “PayPal”) provides this Privacy Statement to describe our use of your Personal Data when you use your PayPal account, Xoom account, visit our websites, apply for, or use our services (collectively, the “
Services
”). This Privacy Statement does not apply to Other Services, such as Hyperwallet. We encourage you to read this Privacy Statement and to use it to help you make informed decisions.
Certain capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in the Statement are explained in the “
Definitions
” section below.
2. PayPal’s role as a data controller
In the United Kingdom (UK),
PayPal UK Ltd
is the data controller for the Personal Data collected and processed in connection with Personal Data obtained when you visit our website, during the registration and application process, and throughout your continued use of the services.
Some of the third-parties that we share Personal Data with are independent data controllers. This means that we are not the ones that dictate how the data that we share will be processed. Examples are authorities, credit bureaus, acquirers, and other financial institutions. When your data is shared with independent data controllers, their data policies will apply. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
For more information about how we protect your Personal Data when transferred outside of the UK, please see Section 8, (“
International Transfers of Personal Data
”).
For most of our Services, we act as a “data controller”, however there are some products and features where PayPal may also act as a “data processor” when providing services to our Partners and Merchants.  The “data controller” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that has the control over the purposes and means by which the data processing is performed.  The “data processor” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that processes the Personal Information for the data controller, for the data controller’s specific purposes, and as otherwise permitted under applicable data protection laws.
3. Non-Account Holders and Fastlane Profile Users
Our Services may be accessed by individuals without a PayPal or Xoom account. We will collect Personal Data from you even if you are a non-account holder when you use our Services, such as when you use our Pay Without a PayPal account, use Unbranded Payment Services (e.g. Braintree), use PayPal Groups, use a Fastlane profile, or when you receive a payment through our Services from account holders (“Recipient”). If you use Pay Without a PayPal account, we may link your transaction information with your PayPal account, if you have one at the time you use the Service without logging in, or if you create a PayPal account later. We use the term “User” to apply to account and non-account holders. If you are a non-account holder, your Personal Data will be used to provide the Services and in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the relevant PayPal
User Agreement
.
With a Fastlane profile, individuals can store their payment methods and other Personal Data with PayPal so that they can complete the checkout process faster, create a store or loyalty account, or facilitate other transactions at participating Partners and Merchants with payment card, contact information, shipping data or other data they save in their Fastlane profile as relevant to the specific interaction, participating Partner or Merchant, all without having to manually input payment method details and other Personal Data each time they check out (“Fastlane”).
When you create a Fastlane profile, PayPal will store your Personal Data, including your name, email, phone number, address information,  billing information and payment method details, and other data that will be relevant to specific Partner or Merchant interactions, and pre-populate that information in the checkout flows or other interactive features of participating Partners and Merchants so that you can enjoy a faster Partner and Merchant experience by not having to manually input your payment or other information. We will also collect transaction and other Partner or Merchant data related to your purchases and other Partner and Merchant interactions when you use Fastlane. If you have a Fastlane profile, we may recognize you as a Fastlane user when you shop on the participating Partners and Merchants sites and we may prompt you to engage in participating Partner or Merchant interactions, such as register for a store or loyalty account  using your Fastlane profile information. If you choose to interact with participating Partners or Merchants through Fastlane, you agree to let PayPal disclose your Fastlane profile information to the Participating Partners and Merchants and their service providers, and to facilitate your transaction and shopping experience on the participating Partners and Merchants sites.
When you shop on Partner and Merchant sites, the Partner and Merchant may disclose Personal Data with PayPal that we will use in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the relevant PayPal user agreement.

The legal basis for this processing is the performance of our contractual obligations to you and for our legitimate interests. We may also disclose Personal Data to Partners and Merchants to enable their use of our Services to facilitate your transactions. For example, when you visit a participating Merchant site or app, the Merchant can check whether you are a user of PayPal services and present a recommended payment method to you to simplify your checkout process.

11. Specific information about automated decision-making and profiling
“
Automated-decision making”
is the process of making a decision by fully automated means without human involvement. In some cases these decisions
could have a legal or similarly significant
effect on you as an individual. “
Profiling
” means analysis of an individual's personality, behaviour, interest and habits to make predictions or decisions about them. Where authorised under UK law or where necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract, we may in some cases use automated decision-making or profiling for decisions. An example of our use of automated decision making is evaluation of your creditworthiness to assess your suitability for certain credit products.
We believe that by making such decisions automatically, PayPal increases its objectivity and transparency in deciding which services to offer you. We deploy several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. You can always ask for a manual decision-making process instead, express your opinion or contest decision making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, if such a decision would produce
legal effects or otherwise similarly significantly affect you
. You can find out more about how to object to these decisions in Section 10
(“Your data protection rights”)
.

if you require more information on our use of Automated-decision making or Profiling.

Your details will be confirmed to other PayPal users in response to a user searching using your name, email address or telephone number, or part of these details. This is to ensure people make payments to the correct user. This feature can be turned off in the PayPal profile settings.
If you as a Partner and Merchant use a third party to access or integrate PayPal, we may disclose to any such third party necessary information for the purpose of facilitating and maintaining such an arrangement (including, without limitation, the status of your PayPal integration, whether you have an active PayPal account and whether you may already be working with a different PayPal integration partner).
Disclose necessary information to the payment processors, auditors, customer services providers, credit reference and fraud agencies, financial products providers, commercial partners, marketing and public relations companies, operational services providers, group companies, agencies, marketplaces and other third parties listed here. The purpose of this disclosure is to allow us to provide PayPal Services to you. We also set out in the list of third parties, under each "Category", non-exclusive examples of the actual third parties (which may include their assigns and successors) to whom we currently disclose your account information or to whom we may consider disclosing your account information, together with the purpose of doing so, and the actual information we disclose (except as explicitly stated, these third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information was shared).
Disclose necessary information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
Disclose aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in Manchester. However, this aggregated information is not tied to Personal Data.
Share necessary account information with unaffiliated third parties (listed here) for their use for the following purposes:
Fraud Prevention and Risk Management: to help prevent fraud or assess and manage risk.
Customer Service: for customer service purposes, including to help service your accounts or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or transactional).
Shipping: in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using PayPal.
Legal Compliance: to help them comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.
Service Providers: to enable service providers under contract with us to support our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, customer service and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.

General Terms
Last modified: November 11, 2024
You and Stripe agree as follows:
1. Your Stripe Account.
1.1 Eligibility.
Only businesses (including sole proprietors) and non-profit organisations located in Ireland are eligible to apply for a Stripe Account and use the Services. Stripe and its Affiliates may provide Services to you or your Affiliates in other countries or regions under separate agreements. You and your Representative must not attempt to create a Stripe Account on behalf of or for the benefit of a user whose use of the Stripe services was suspended or terminated by Stripe, unless Stripe approves otherwise.
1.2 Business Representative.
You and your Representative individually affirm to Stripe that (a) your Representative is authorised to provide User Information on your behalf and to bind you to this Agreement; and (b) your Representative is an executive officer, director, senior manager or otherwise has significant responsibility for the control, management or direction of your business. Stripe may require you or your Representative to provide additional information or documentation demonstrating your Representative’s authority.
1.3 Sole Proprietors.
If you are a sole proprietor, you and your Representative also affirm that your Representative is personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services and your obligations to Customers, including payment of amounts you owe under this Agreement.
1.4 Age Requirements.
If you are a sole proprietor, and you are not old enough to enter into a contract on your own behalf (which is commonly but not always 18 years old), but you are 13 years old or older, your Representative must be your parent or legal guardian. If you are a legal entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, by an individual who is not old enough to enter into a contract on their own behalf, but the individual is 13 years old or older, your Representative must obtain the consent of either your board or an authorised officer. The approving board, authorised officer, parent or legal guardian is responsible to Stripe and is legally bound to this Agreement as if it had agreed to this Agreement itself. You must not use the Services if you are under 13 years of age.
2. Services and Support.
2.1 Services.
Stripe (and its Affiliates, as applicable) will make available to you the Services, including those described in the applicable Services Terms, and, if applicable, give you access to a Stripe Dashboard.
2.2 Services Terms; Order of Precedence.
The Services Terms contain specific terms governing the parties’ rights and obligations related to the Services described in those Services Terms. If there are no Services Terms for a particular Stripe service, then only these General Terms govern. By accessing or using a Service, you agree to comply with the applicable Services Terms. If any term in these General Terms conflicts with a term in any Services Terms or set of terms incorporated by reference into this Agreement, then unless terms of lower precedence expressly state to the contrary, the order of precedence is: (a) the Services Terms; (b) these General Terms; and (c) all terms incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Your access to or use of the Services may also be subject to additional terms to which you agree through the Stripe Dashboard.
2.3 Service Modifications and Updates.
Stripe may modify the Services and Stripe Technology at any time, including adding or removing functionality or imposing conditions on use of the Services. Stripe will notify you of material adverse changes in, deprecations to, or removal of functionality from, Services or Stripe Technology that you are using. Stripe is not obligated to provide any Updates. However, if Stripe makes an Update available, you must fully install the Update by the date or within the time period stated in Stripe’s notice; or, if there is no date or period stated in the notice, then no later than 30 days after the date of the notice.
2.4 Subcontracting.
Stripe may subcontract its obligations under this Agreement to third parties.
2.5 Services Restrictions.
You may only use the Services for business purposes. You must not, and must not enable or allow any third party to:
(a) use the Services for personal, family or household purposes;
(b) act as service bureau or pass-through agent for the Services with no added value to Customers;
(c) work around any of the technical limitations of the Services or enable functionality that is disabled or prohibited, or access or attempt to access non-public Stripe systems, programs, data, or services;
(d) except as Law permits, reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer the Services or Stripe Technology;
(e) use the Services to engage in any activity that is illegal, fraudulent, deceptive, exploitative, or harmful;

(a)
Classification
. Stripe may classify certain Stripe services or Stripe Technology, including a particular product or feature release, as being in a Preview phase. A Stripe service may be generally available in some circumstances (e.g., in some countries or regions) while still released or classified as Preview in other circumstances.
(b)
Nature of Preview Services
. By their nature, Preview Services may be feature-incomplete or contain bugs. Stripe may describe limitations that exist within a Preview Service; however, your reliance on the accuracy or completeness of these descriptions is at your own risk. You should not use Preview Services in a production environment until and unless you understand and accept the limitations and flaws that may be present in the Preview Services.
(c)
Feedback
. Unless Stripe otherwise agrees in writing, your use of Preview Services is confidential, and you must provide timely Feedback on the Preview Services in response to Stripe requests.
(d)

contact us
. Stripe is not responsible for providing support to Customers.
2.8 Third-Party Services.
Stripe may reference, enable you to access, or promote (including on the Stripe Website) Third-Party Services. These Third-Party Services are provided for your convenience only and Stripe does not approve, endorse, or recommend any Third-Party Services to you.
Your access and use of any Third-Party Service is at your own risk and Stripe disclaims all responsibility and liability for your use of any Third-Party Service. Third-Party Services are not Services and are not governed by this Agreement or Stripe’s Privacy Policy. Your use of any Third-Party Service, including those linked from the Stripe Website, is subject to that Third-Party Service’s own terms of use and privacy policies (if any).
2.9 Modifications to Services or Stripe Technology.
(a)
Right to Modify
. Stripe may modify or discontinue any part of a Service or Stripe Technology, including ceasing to offer that Service or Stripe Technology in a particular country. Stripe will provide you reasonable notice if the modification or discontinuation would materially reduce the functionality of a Service or Stripe Technology that you are using, unless giving notice would (i) pose a security issue to Stripe; or (ii) cause Stripe to violate Law or breach any legal obligation to a Governmental Authority or Financial Partner.
(b)
Updates
. Stripe is not obligated to provide any Updates. If Stripe does make an Update available, you must install the Update by the date or within the time period stated in Stripe’s notice; or, if there is no date or period stated in the notice, then no later than 30 days after the date of the notice.
3. Information; Your Business.
3.1 User Information.
Upon Stripe’s request, you must provide User Information to Stripe in a form satisfactory to Stripe. You must keep the User Information in your Stripe Account current. You must promptly update your Stripe Account with any changes affecting you, the nature of your business activities, your Representative, beneficial owners, principals, or any other pertinent information. You must immediately notify Stripe, and provide to Stripe updated User Information, if (a) you experience or anticipate experiencing a Change of Control; (b) you experience or anticipate experiencing a material change in your business or financial condition, including if you experience or are likely to experience an Insolvency Event; (c) the regulatory status of the business for which you are using the Services changes, including if it becomes subject, or no longer subject, to regulatory oversight; or (d) a Governmental Authority has notified you that you or your business is the subject of investigative action.
3.2 Information Stripe Obtains.
You authorise Stripe to obtain information about you and your business from Stripe’s service providers and other third parties, including credit reporting agencies, banking partners and information bureaus, for the purposes of this Agreement. This information may include your, or your representative’s, name, addresses, credit history, banking relationships, and financial history. You must authorise and direct those third parties to compile and provide this information to Stripe.
4. Services Fees; Taxes.
4.1 Services Fees.
The Fees are stated on the Stripe Pricing Page, unless you and Stripe otherwise agree in writing. Subject to the requirements of Law, Stripe may revise the Fees at any time. Stripe may, from time to time, offer a Service or Service feature without charge, or waive a Fee for that Service or Service feature. If Stripe  increases a Fee, or introduces a new Fee, for a Service that you are currently using, then Stripe will notify you at least 30 days (or longer period if Law requires) before the revised or new Fee applies to you.
4.2 Collection of Fees and Other Amounts.
You must pay, or ensure that Stripe is able to collect, Fees, Taxes, and other amounts you owe under this Agreement when due. Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff Fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreements you have with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, from your Stripe Account balance, or invoice you for those amounts. If you fail to pay invoiced amounts when due, if your Stripe Account balance is negative or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, or if Stripe is unable to collect amounts due from your Stripe Account balance, then Stripe may, to the extent Law permits, deduct, recoup or setoff those amounts from: (a) if established and applicable, each Reserve; (b) funds payable by Stripe or its Affiliate to you or your Affiliate; (c) if established, each User Affiliate Reserve; (d) each User Bank Account; and (e) the Stripe account balance of each Stripe account that Stripe determines, acting reasonably, is associated with you or your Affiliate. If the currency of the amount being deducted is different from the currency of the amount you owe, Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff an amount equal to the amount owed (using Stripe’s conversion rate) together with any fees Stripe incurs in making the conversion.
4.3 Debit Authorisation.
Without limiting Section 4.2 of these General Terms, you authorise Stripe to debit each User Bank Account without separate notice, and according to the applicable
User Bank Account Debit Authorisation
, to collect amounts you owe under this Agreement. If Stripe is unable to collect those amounts by debiting a User Bank Account, then you immediately grant to Stripe a new, original authorisation to debit each User Bank Account without notice and according to the applicable
User Bank Account Debit Authorisation
. Stripe may rely on this authorisation to make one or more attempts to collect all or a subset of the amounts owed. Your authorisation under this Section 4.3 will remain in full force and effect until (a) all of your Stripe Accounts are closed; or (b) all fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement are paid, whichever occurs later. If applicable debit scheme authorisation rules grant you the right to revoke your debit authorisation, then to the extent Law permits, you waive that right.
4.4 Taxes.
The Fees exclude all Taxes, except as the Stripe Pricing Page expressly states to the contrary. You have sole responsibility and liability for:
(a) determining which, if any, Taxes or fees apply to the sale of your products and services, acceptance of donations, or payments you make or receive in connection with your use of the Services; and
(b) assessing, collecting, reporting and remitting Taxes for your business.
If Stripe is required by Law to collect or withhold any Taxes, Stripe may deduct those Taxes from amounts otherwise owed to you and pay those Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. If you are exempt from paying, or are otherwise eligible to pay a reduced rate on, those Taxes, you may provide to Stripe an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to your tax-exempt status or reduced rate eligibility, in which case Stripe will not deduct the Taxes that certificate covers. You must provide accurate information regarding your tax affairs as Stripe reasonably requests, and must promptly notify Stripe if any information that Stripe prepopulates is inaccurate or incomplete. Stripe may send documents to you and taxing authorities for transactions processed using the Services. Specifically, Law may require Stripe to file periodic informational returns with taxing authorities related to your use of the Services. Stripe may send tax-related information electronically to you.
5. User Bank Accounts; Funds.
5.1 User Bank Accounts; Prohibition on Grant or Assignment.
You must designate at least one User Bank Account in connection with the Services. Stripe may debit and credit a User Bank Account as described in this Agreement. You must not grant or assign to any third party any lien on or interest in funds that may be owed to you under this Agreement until the funds are deposited into a User Bank Account.
5.2 Holding of Funds.
To the extent Law and the applicable Financial Services Terms permit, Stripe and its Affiliates may invest funds they hold into liquid investments. Stripe or its applicable Affiliates will (a) hold these investments separate from investments made with their own funds, and (b) own, and User will not receive, any earnings from these investments. Stripe and its Affiliates' investment of funds will not affect or delay Stripe's payout obligations under this Agreement.
5.3 Authorised Payment Services.
Stripe Technology Europe, Limited ("
Stripe PSP
") is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. The Central Bank of Ireland has authorised Stripe PSP as an electronic money institution under reference number C187865. Stripe PSP does not offer any form of deposit or savings account. Stripe PSP is not part of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. To the extent the Services are Authorised Payment Services, Stripe PSP is the only provider of those Services. As the provider of Authorised Payment Services, Stripe PSP will be the only Stripe party liable to you for collecting payment proceeds from Transactions on your behalf, safeguarding those proceeds, and settling those proceeds to your User Bank Account or as you otherwise direct. Stripe is not a bank, and does not accept deposits.
5.4 E-Money Services; Using a Third-Party Payment Services Provider.
(a)
E-money Services
. Depending on your location and, if applicable, your Connected Accounts’ locations, Stripe may offer E-money Services to you. The terms in this Section 5.4 only apply if Stripe provides E-money Services to you. You may use the Services to purchase E-money from Stripe, to send and receive E-money, and, if applicable, to transfer E-money to Connected Accounts. You will not receive any earnings from E-money that Stripe issues or holds. If Stripe holds E-money for you, Stripe will safeguard that E-money according to Law. You may use the Stripe Technology to redeem E-money Stripe holds for you for par value, and Stripe will settle funds to the User Bank Account according to the Payout Schedule.
(b)
Using a Third-Party Payment Service Provider (TPP)
. If Stripe provides a Payment Account to you, you may enable a TPP to access information regarding that Payment Account or make payments from the Payment Account according to Law. You must ensure that each TPP you use (if any) is authorised or registered with the applicable Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, as among the parties, you are liable for the TPP’s acts and omissions. If necessary to allow the TPP to access your Payment Account, you may provide your Stripe Account credentials to the TPP. Stripe may refuse to allow any TPP to access information regarding your Payment Account if Stripe reasonably believes that the TPP’s actions are unauthorised, fraudulent or illegal. Unless Law prohibits notification, Stripe will notify you if Stripe takes this action. You must notify Stripe immediately if you believe a payment made through a TPP was unauthorised or incorrect.
5.5 Assessed Fines.
You (a) are responsible for all Assessed Fines; and (b) must reimburse Stripe for its payment of Assessed Fines, except to the extent the Assessed Fines result from Stripe’s (i) breach of Law, the Agreement, or Financial Services Terms; or (ii) negligence.
6. Termination; Suspension; Survival.
6.1 Termination.
(a)
Your Termination
. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by closing your Stripe Account. To do so,
you must open the account information tab in your account settings
, select “close my account” and stop using the Services. If after termination you use the Services again, this Agreement will apply with an Effective Date that is the date on which you first use the Services again.

Stripe Termination

(c)
Termination for Material Breach
. A party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other parties if any of the other parties materially breaches this Agreement, and if capable of cure, does not cure the breach within 10 days after receiving notice specifying the breach. If the material breach affects only certain Services, the non-breaching party that served the notice may choose to terminate only the affected Services.
(d)
Effect on Other Agreements
. Unless stated to the contrary, termination of this Agreement will not affect any other agreement between the parties or their Affiliates.
6.2 Suspension.

(c) you do not update in a timely manner your implementation of the Services or Stripe Technology to the latest production version Stripe recommends or requires;

Stripe may periodically review your Stripe Account information to verify that you are eligible to use the Stripe Payments Services.
3.8 Customer Communication.
When using the Stripe Payments Services you must, with respect to Customers (a) accurately communicate and not misrepresent the nature, amount and currency of each Transaction prior to submitting it for processing; (b) provide a receipt that accurately describes each Transaction; (c) provide a meaningful way to contact you in the event that your goods or services are not provided as described; (d) not use the Stripe Payments Services to sell goods or services in a manner that is unfair or deceptive, exposes Customers to unreasonable risks, or does not disclose material terms of a purchase in advance; (e) inform Customers that Stripe processes Transactions for you; and (f) if you are collecting authorisations electronically, ensure that Customers consent to electronic signatures and delivery of communications in accordance with Law. If you engage in Transactions with Customers who are consumers, you must provide the disclosures Law requires, and must not engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.
3.9 Requirements Imposed by Payment Method Rules.
As required by the Payment Method Rules (a) as between the parties, each party is responsible for the acts and omissions of its employees, contractors and agents; (b) unless a Payment Method Provider agrees otherwise, you cannot bind a Payment Method Provider to any contract or obligation, and you must not represent that you can do so; (c) you will meet data quality requirements for relevant categories of Transaction data (as described in the Payment Method Rules) and in respect of that data, you must comply with all technical specifications mandated by the relevant Payment Method Provider; and (d) you must ensure that Transaction data that you collect is processed promptly, accurately and completely. You must maintain and make available to Customers a fair and neutral refund and exchange policy, and clearly explain the process by which Customers can receive a Refund. Payment Method Providers retain all IP Rights in their Marks, and you must not contest any Payment Method Provider’s IP Rights in their Marks. You may only use Payment Method Providers’ Marks in a manner consistent with the Payment Method Rules, and you must promptly comply with all instructions from Stripe regarding use or presentation of Payment Method Providers’ Marks. You are solely responsible for providing support to Customers regarding Transaction receipts, product or service delivery, support, returns, refunds and all other issues related to your goods and services and business activities. Without limiting the previous sentence, you must make customer service information readily available to your Customers, including clear instructions on how your Customers can contact you by email and telephone.
3.10 Stripe Radar; Your Responsibility for Transactions.
The Stripe Radar Services may be enabled by default and are governed by the Stripe Radar Terms. If you do not wish to use the Stripe Radar Services in connection with Stripe Payments Services, you must
contact Stripe support
to disable it. You are solely responsible for all losses you and the Stripe Parties incur due to erroneous and fraudulent Transactions that occur in connection with your use of the Services, including as a result of (a) lost or stolen payment credentials or the details of any accounts that are used to purchase goods or services from you; (b) any changes to the User Bank Accounts; and (c) any unauthorised use of, or access or modification to, your Stripe Account.
4. Processing Transactions.
4.1 Blended Fees.
By using Stripe Payments Services, you request Stripe to blend Fees for payment card processing for all merchant services charges, regardless of the underlying differences in interchange fees between different payment card brands and categories. If you have a question about Fees or wish to receive unblended rates for payment card processing, please
contact us
.
4.2 Payment Authorisation Requests.
(a)
Processing Transactions.
To enable Stripe to process Transactions for you, you authorise and direct Stripe, its Affiliates, Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to receive and settle, as applicable, settlement funds owed to you through your use of the Stripe Payments Services. You may only submit Transactions that Customers authorise, and only after the applicable goods have been shipped or services provided to the Customer; except, you may submit a Transaction before goods have been shipped or services have been provided to the Customer where the Customer has authorised a Transaction for a partial or full prepayment for goods or services to be provided at a future time, or you have obtained the Customer’s consent.
(b)
Transaction Responsibility.
You must not proceed with a Transaction if (i) you know or should have known that the Transaction was fraudulent, not authorised by the Customer, or illegal in your or your Customer’s jurisdiction; (ii) you receive a response declining to authorise the Transaction; or (iii) the Customer’s ability to use a Payment Method has expired or is no longer valid. You must not split payment for a single transaction into multiple Transactions except as the Payment Method Rules, Payment Method Terms and Acquirer Terms expressly permit. You must not submit any Transaction that duplicates a Transaction that is already subject to a Dispute, or was previously disputed and subsequently resolved in your favour. Stripe may refuse to process, or condition or suspend any Transaction that Stripe believes (x) may violate this Agreement or other agreement you have with Stripe (if any); (y) is unauthorised, fraudulent or illegal; or (z) exposes, or is likely to expose, Stripe, you or others to unacceptable risk. When submitting an authorisation request for a Transaction that will be processed using Visa Secure, you must input the Cardholder Authentication Verification Value ("CAVV") your issuing bank or Visa provides to you.
4.3  Settlement Funds.
You appoint Stripe as your agent for the limited purpose of directing, receiving, holding and settling funds under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, no agency is established for tax purposes. All settlement funds Stripe receives for Transactions are combined with settlement funds held for other Stripe users and safeguarded as Safeguarded Funds.  Once Stripe receives settlement funds, the relevant Customer has no further obligation to make payments to you with respect to a Transaction. Stripe will promptly update your Stripe Account balance to reflect processed Transactions. If, in the capacity as your agent, Stripe provides a receipt for a Transaction to the applicable Customer, that receipt is binding on you. Prior to transferring settlement funds to the User Bank Account, Stripe may invest Safeguarded Funds as described in Section 5.2 of the General Terms. You have no rights to any earnings generated by Safeguarded Funds and are not entitled to draw funds from any Pooled Account.
4.4 Transaction Settlement Funds.
Stripe will transfer settlement funds for Transactions, net of Fees, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals and other amounts owed to Stripe, from the applicable Pooled Account to the applicable User Bank Account within the time period stated in the Payout Schedule, unless a Payout Delay occurs and affects the transfer initiation, or Stripe exercises a right under this Agreement to withhold or delay the transfer. However, Stripe may impose an additional holding period before making the initial settlement to a User Bank Account.
4.5 Sending Funds to Third-Party Recipients.
Stripe may offer you the ability to send to a third party funds owed to you as you instruct Stripe (including by sending all or part of the positive balance in your Stripe Account to that third-party recipient’s Stripe account or bank account), instead of settling funds to a User Bank Account. If Stripe sends funds to a third-party recipient which may include the use of a payment intermediary operating on your behalf, as this Section 4.5 contemplates, then Stripe’s obligations (and all applicable Payment Method Provider and Payment Method Acquirer obligations) to settle those funds to you are satisfied.
4.6 Settlement Fees.
Stripe is not responsible for any fees imposed by banks to which Stripe transfers funds, including the banks that hold the User Bank Accounts and the third-party recipient accounts.
4.7 Subscriptions and Invoicing.
If you use the Services to submit recurring or subscription Transactions, then before submitting the initial Transaction, you must (a) inform each Customer that the relevant Transactions will occur on an ongoing basis; and (b) explain the method for cancelling the Customer’s recurring billing or subscription. If you use the Services to issue invoices to Customers, you must ensure that the form and content of the invoices comply with Law and are sufficient to achieve the legal or tax effects that you are trying to achieve.
4.8 Customer Authorisations.
If you use the Stripe Payments Services for certain Transactions where the Customer is not present, including MOTO Transactions or Merchant Initiated Transactions, or to store a Customer’s Payment Method for future use, you may be required by Law and Payment Method Rules to obtain the Customer’s authorisation (also known as a mandate or agreement for the provision of products or services) and make certain disclosures to the Customer. These disclosures may include when, and under what circumstances, the Customer’s Payment Method will be charged, how the payment amount will be determined, and how future payments can be canceled. You must retain, and provide to Stripe upon request, records demonstrating that you have (a) obtained any required Customer authorisations in compliance with Law and Payment Method Rules; and (b) only submitted Transactions as MOTO Transactions or Merchant Initiated Transactions that you have determined are eligible.
5. Actions Stripe May Take in Processing Transactions.
5.1 Reconciliation and Responsibility.
As between the parties, and except as required by Law, you are responsible for reviewing your Transaction history for accuracy and completeness, and reconciling your Transaction history with the history of transfers from the Pooled Accounts to the User Bank Accounts. If you find an error when you reconcile your Transaction history, Stripe will reasonably cooperate with you to investigate and help correct that error as long as you notify Stripe of the error within 13 months after the error appears in your Transaction history. Stripe may correct any errors in your Transaction history by crediting or debiting the User Bank Accounts.
5.2 Negative Balances.
If your Stripe Account balance (or the Stripe Account balance of any User Entity) is negative, or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you (or a User Entity) owe to a Stripe Entity or Customers, then without limiting Stripe’s rights under Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the General Terms, Stripe may debit the User Bank Accounts by the amount necessary to collect, and pay out to Customers if applicable, the amounts you owe.
5.3 Disputes; Refunds; Reversals.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, you are liable to Stripe for the full amount of all Disputes (unless and until a Dispute is resolved to final disposition in your favor according to applicable Payment Method Rules and as described in the Documentation), Refunds and Reversals regardless of the reason or timing.
(a)
Disputes
. Stripe may delay or withhold paying out a Transaction amount from funds owed to you if Stripe reasonably believes that a Dispute is likely to occur with respect to that Transaction. Stripe may delay or withhold paying out amounts subject to an actual Dispute until the Payment Method Provider resolves the Dispute.
(b)
Refunds
. If you intend to issue a Refund to a Customer, you must initiate a Refund instruction via the Services within 5 days after informing the Customer of your intention. Stripe may refuse to act upon a Refund instruction, or delay executing the instruction, if you are the subject of an Insolvency Event, if it would cause a negative balance in your Stripe Account, or if Stripe believes that there is a risk you will not meet your liabilities under this Agreement.
(c)
Reversals
. Without limiting Stripe’s rights under Sections 5.4 - 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms, Stripe may initiate a Reversal if:
(i) the Payment Method Provider invalidates the Transaction;
(ii) you receive funds in error for any reason;
(iii) you were not authorised to accept the Transaction;
(iv) you receive funds related to activities that violate this Agreement, Law or Financial Services Terms; or
(v) a Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer requires Stripe to do so under the applicable Financial Services Terms.
5.4 Stripe Remedies – Specific Triggers.
Stripe may exercise any or all of the remedies stated in Section 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms if Stripe determines that a User Entity:
(a) has incurred or is likely to incur excessive Disputes, Refunds or Reversals;
(b) has submitted one or more Transactions for goods or services not immediately deliverable to the Customer without first obtaining Stripe’s consent;
(c) has a negative Stripe Account balance;
(d) has experienced or is likely to experience a change in the average time between the initial charge and fulfilment of Customer orders that Stripe considers to be material;
(e) is or is likely to become the subject of an Insolvency Event;
(f) has experienced or is likely to experience a deterioration of its business or financial condition that Stripe considers to be material;
(g) has breached or is likely to breach, or has caused or is likely to cause Stripe to breach, this Agreement (or any other Stripe services agreement with a Stripe Entity) or the Financial Services Terms applicable to the User Entity’s use of the Services;
(h) has violated or is likely to violate Law or Financial Services Terms;
(i) has caused or is likely to cause Stripe to violate Law or Financial Services Terms;
(j) has experienced or is likely to experience a Change of Control;
(k) has, either itself or by way of its employees, agents, directors or contractors, initiated Transactions or undertaken any other action that is or is likely to be fraudulent, suspicious or involve criminal activity;
(l) has, without Stripe’s prior consent, changed its business model (including services supplied by a User Entity to its customers), exposing Stripe to increased risk; or
(m) has acted in a manner or engaged in business, trading practice or other activity that presents an unacceptable risk.
5.5 Stripe Remedies – General Trigger.
Stripe may exercise any or all of the remedies stated in Section 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms if (a) Stripe reasonably determines that Stripe may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, criminal activity or other risks associated with a User Entity after these Stripe Payments Terms terminate; or (b) Law requires.
5.6 Stripe Remedies – Scope.
Stripe may, in accordance with Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of these Stripe Payments Terms:
(a) initiate Reversals;
(b) change the Payout Schedule or delay or cancel the payout of funds to the User Bank Accounts;
(c) establish, fund and use a Reserve;
(d) debit the User Bank Accounts or the bank or financial institution accounts of any or all User Group Entities;
(e) suspend or terminate your ability to accept or process Transactions;
(f) refuse to (i) process Transactions, and (ii) act upon Refund instructions; and
(g) setoff or recoup all liability that Stripe reasonably determines a User Entity owes to Stripe or a Stripe Affiliate under this Agreement or another agreement, against any amounts that a Stripe Entity owes to a User Entity whether the liability is matured, unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated.
5.7 Reserve.
If Stripe establishes a Reserve, Stripe will notify you of the Reserve terms. If Stripe uses Safeguarded Funds to fund a Reserve, then Stripe will no longer safeguard those funds on your behalf. Stripe may change the Reserve terms (a) if Stripe believes that there is, or is likely to be, a change in the underlying risk presented by the User Group’s use of Stripe services; or (b) as a Payment Method Acquirer or Payment Method Provider requires. Stripe will hold all Reserves in Pooled Reserve Accounts with Financial Partners in Stripe's name and will own all earnings generated from those Reserves. You have no legal or equitable right or interest in any Reserve, or earnings generated by any Reserve, and are not entitled to draw from any Reserve. If you become subject to an Insolvency Event, a Reserve will not be part of any estate created in connection with that Insolvency Event. Stripe may fund a Reserve through any or all of:
(i) using funds you provide upon Stripe’s request;
(ii) using funds that a Stripe Entity owes to any User Entity for Transactions that the User Group accepts through the Stripe Payments Services; and
(iii) debiting the User Bank Accounts or the bank or financial institution accounts of any or all User Group Entities.
5.8 Security Interest.
You will execute all documents Stripe reasonably requests to create, perfect, maintain and enforce a security interest over assets Stripe believes are necessary to secure your performance of your payment obligations under this Agreement.
5.9 Credit Support Requirement.
Stripe may require that you provide a guarantee (including a personal, parent or bank guarantee) or letter of credit in a form and substance that satisfies Stripe. In this event, Stripe will inform you of the amount of and the reasons for the requirement. If you are unable to satisfy the requirement when Stripe requires you to do so, Stripe may suspend or terminate your access to the Services.
6. Multi-Currency Processing.
Stripe may offer Multi-Currency Processing. To use Multi-Currency Processing, you must provide to Stripe a valid bank account for each currency for which you request settlement, based on the list of available settlement currencies stated in the Documentation. Each of these bank accounts is a User Bank Account for the purposes of this Agreement. If you use Multi-Currency Processing, Stripe will identify at the time of each applicable Transaction the conversion rate that will apply to the Transaction. In the event of a Refund, the conversion rate that will be used to calculate the Refund will be the rate in effect at the time of the Refund.
7. Post-Termination Obligations.
7.1 Completion of Transactions.
Following termination of these Stripe Payments Terms, you must fulfil your obligations related to existing Transactions, not accept new Transactions via the Services, and remove all Marks of a Stripe Entity or a Financial Partner from your website (unless permitted under a separate license with the applicable Financial Partner). Stripe will complete Transactions initiated before termination as long as Stripe would have completed those Transactions were these Stripe Payments Terms still in place (e.g., Stripe will not complete a Transaction if a Financial Partner prohibits Stripe from doing so). Termination does not affect your responsibility for Transactions described in Section 3 of these Stripe Payments Terms.
7.2 Provision of Payment Account Details.
If these Stripe Payments Terms terminate for reasons other than your breach, then within 30 days after the termination date, you may request in writing that Stripe provide all relevant Payment Account Details to an alternative PCI-DSS Level 1-certified payment processor that you identify to Stripe. Stripe will provide the Payment Account Details that you are entitled to receive to the named payment processor to the extent commercially reasonable. Stripe may delay or refuse any request if Stripe believes the payment processor you have identified does not have systems or controls in place that are sufficient to protect Payment Account Details, that the integrity of Payment Account Details may be compromised, or that Law or Financial Services Terms do not allow Stripe to provide the Payment Account Details.
8. User Information Updates.
You must immediately notify Stripe, and provide to Stripe updated User Information, if you experience or anticipate experiencing a material change in the average time between the initial charge and fulfilment of Customer orders. Upon request, you must promptly provide to Stripe information related to Transactions and Disputes, including (a) refund and shipping policies (if applicable); (b) data on captured but unfulfilled charges; and (c) data on the time between charge capture and fulfilment of Customer orders.
9. PCI Standards Compliance.
If you elect to store or hold "Account Data," as defined in the PCI Standards (including Customer card account number or expiration date), you must maintain a system that complies with the PCI Standards and upon Stripe’s request, you must provide to Stripe evidence of your compliance. If you do not comply with the PCI Standards, or if Stripe or any Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer is unable to verify your compliance with the PCI Standards, Stripe may suspend your Stripe Account or terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part. If you intend to use a third-party service provider to store or transmit Payment Account Details (including Customer card account number and expiration date) then you must not share any Payment Account Details with the service provider until you verify that the third party holds sufficient certifications under the PCI Standards, and must
notify Stripe
of your intention to share Payment Account Details with the service provider. Further, you agree to never store or hold any "Sensitive Authentication Data," as defined by the PCI Standards (including the card verification value or similar security code), at any time. You can find information about the PCI Standards on the
PCI Council’s website
.
10. Representations and Warranties.
You represent as of the Effective Date, and warrant during the Term, that (a) you only use the Payment Methods and Stripe Payments Services for bona fide commercial transactions (which must be free of liens, claims, and encumbrances other than ordinary sales taxes) for the sale of goods or services to, or other act with, Customers; (b) except as Stripe approves, you do not use the Stripe Payments Services for intercompany transactions; (c) you fulfil all of your obligations to Customers; and (d) you and your third-party service providers that store, access or transmit Payment Account Details comply with the PCI Standards, as applicable.
11. Fraudulent Transactions.
As between the parties, you are responsible for all (a) losses, damages, and costs Stripe and its Affiliates incur due to fraudulent Transactions, and the limitations on liability in Section 12.2 of the SSA do not apply; and (b) costs associated with any Financial Partner-initiated audit or forensic investigation arising out of or relating to your use of the Stripe Payments Services.
12. Liability for Failure to Transfer Funds.
The limitation of liability in Section 12.2(b) of the General Terms will not apply to claims you or your Affiliates make against the Stripe Parties for failing to transfer any settlement funds the Stripe Parties receive and owe to you in connection with the Stripe Payments Services. For these claims, the Stripe Parties’ liability is limited to the amount that the Stripe Parties have received and owe, but failed to transfer, to you.
13. Complaints.
If you have a complaint with the Stripe Payments Services, please contact complaints@stripe.com. You can find more information about Stripe’s Complaints Policy

At Stripe’s request, you must provide proof as Stripe requires that these agreements have been entered into between the Connected Accounts and Stripe.

5.3    Changes in Risk Profile.

5.5    Liability for Merchant Losses During Post-SMR Transition Period.
You and the relevant Platform User become jointly and severally liable to Stripe for all Merchant Losses on all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts associated with a Platform User from when you initiate the first Transaction for that Platform User on a Connected Account type that does not enable Stripe Managed Risk Services. Stripe may collect these amounts according to the Agreement and the Connected Account Agreement, as applicable, including Merchant Losses that arise during the Post-SMR Transition Period resulting from Activity that occurred before the Post-SMR Transition Period. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, Stripe’s aggregate liability for Merchant Losses on all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts during the Post-SMR Transition Period will not exceed the amount of the General Damages cap stated in Section 12 of the General Terms.

Stripe Climate
Last modified: November 20, 2023
These Stripe Climate Commitment terms (“
Climate Commitment Terms
”) and Stripe Climate Orders terms (“
Climate Orders Terms
”) (collectively, the “
Terms
”) supplement the General Terms, and govern your use of Stripe Climate Commitment and Stripe Climate Orders. Frontier Climate Operations, LLC (“
Frontier
”), Stripe’s Affiliate, provides Stripe Climate Orders. For purposes of Stripe Climate Orders, each reference to "
Stripe
" in the General Terms will be read as a reference to Frontier.
1. Overview
Stripe conducts research into Climate Projects and purchases carbon removal services.  You may make voluntary contributions to Climate Projects through Stripe Climate Commitment. Frontier uses Offtake Agreements to acquire Carbon Removal Units. You may verify the availability of, and purchase Retirement Services through Stripe Climate Orders.
2. Stripe Climate Commitment Terms
2.1 Opting In and Out, and Changes.
You must opt in to make a contribution during onboarding or via the Stripe Climate Commitment page of your Stripe Dashboard You may opt out of, change, or pause your contribution to Stripe Climate Commitment at any time in your Stripe Dashboard.
2.2 Climate Commitment Funds.
(a)
Climate Commitment Funds Allocation
. Once you opt in, Stripe or its Affiliate may deduct the Climate Commitment Funds from your Stripe Account balance or User Bank Account on a per-Transaction basis, or as an amount aggregated over a period of time, as described in your Stripe Dashboard. Stripe will allocate all Climate Commitment Funds to advance the field of carbon removal, through activities such as purchasing metric tons of carbon removal, or funding research and development for new carbon removal technologies. Climate Commitment Funds are not refundable.
(b)
Stripe Climate Commitment Goals
. The goal of Stripe Climate Commitment is to help advance the field of carbon removal and Climate Commitment Funds will be used in support of that goal. While Stripe will use reasonable efforts to fund impactful Climate Projects, companies receiving Climate Commitment Funds are developing new technology in an evolving industry and their survival and success in addressing climate issues are not guaranteed. Development timelines of many new technologies are long, the resulting impact may not be immediate, and there is always a risk that the chosen technologies fail to deliver any carbon removal. Even if they are eventually successful in obtaining results, Climate Projects may take years to produce those results.
(c)
Use of Climate Commitment Funds
. You decide voluntarily whether to, and in what amount, to allocate Climate Commitment Funds. Stripe may choose not to use your Climate Commitment Funds immediately after deducting them from your Stripe Account; rather, Stripe may allocate them after Stripe identifies a Climate Project. Stripe will inform you regularly about how Climate Commitment Funds were allocated. Stripe will not apply Climate Commitment Funds toward its own corporate or administrative costs.
(d)
No Carbon Credits
. The carbon removal services Stripe purchases are not certified by any governmental or non-governmental body. They are not “authorized” under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Stripe disclaims all warranties regarding (i) the status under applicable governmental or non-governmental programs or pursuant to standards set by governmental or non-governmental bodies, whether implemented now or in the future, (ii) the availability of any current or future tax credit, benefit, or treatment, or (iii) any other financial benefits, associated with  the carbon removal services that Stripe purchases.
(e)
Taxes
. The Climate Commitment Funds you allocate may not be eligible for a tax deduction. You should consult with your tax or legal advisor on the local tax treatment of allocated Climate Commitment Funds. Climate Commitment Funds exclude all Taxes, except as the Documentation states to the contrary.
3. Stripe Climate Orders Terms
3.1 Your Use of Stripe Climate Orders.

You may verify the availability of CRUs for Retirement, and purchase Retirement Services using the Climate API or the Dashboard.  While Frontier will provide you with information about the CRUs available for Retirement, it is your responsibility to verify that the CRUs meet your needs or the needs of a Beneficiary.
(c) Frontier may be unable to acquire sufficient quantities of CRUs to fulfill orders for Retirement Services. The CRU(s) that Frontier ultimately Retires on your behalf may have been generated from an Offtake Agreement that Frontier executed after your initial purchase. In order to provide Retirement Services, Frontier reserves the right to: (i) substitute CRUs from any one carbon removal supplier with a CRU from a different carbon removal supplier; or (ii) allocate then-current inventory of CRUs among Purchasers.
(d) The CRUs are not “authorized” under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

Frontier will Retire and record the CRU in the applicable Registry in accordance with and subject to the rules of that Registry.
(b) Frontier may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, Retire and record partial CRUs (i.e., partial tons) with a Registry. Frontier may combine partial CRUs and record them in Frontier’s name.

Frontier will not be liable to you for any other losses, damages, or costs that you or others may suffer arising out of or relating to Frontier’s inability to perform the Retirement Services or the associated CRU.
(f) If Frontier is unable to contact you, or is unable to provide a refund of Fees, for any reason (e.g., you have closed your Stripe Account), Frontier will contribute any amounts due to you to carbon removal programs of its choosing.

You may only impose liability on Issuing Authorised Users in connection with the Stripe Issuing Program as Law allows. Issuing Authorised Users act under your authority and are not customers of Stripe.
2.3 Compliance.
You represent as of the Effective Date, and warrant at all times during the Term, that you (a) are a commercial business enterprise and the Stripe Issuing Account is for business purposes only; (b) will not use, or permit an Issuing Authorised User to use, the Stripe Issuing Accountholder Services for Card Unauthorised Purposes; and (c) will comply, and ensure that your Stripe Issuing Administrator and Issuing Authorised Users comply, with the Stripe Issuing Program Guidelines.
2.4 Issuing Complaint Handling.
You must submit each Issuing Complaint within 3 business days after you receive the Issuing Complaint, to your Platform Provider or, if you do not have one, to issuing-complaints@stripe.com.
2.5 Providing Information.
As a condition of using the Stripe Issuing Accountholder Services, Stripe may require you to provide User Information, information regarding Issuing Authorised Users (including name, address, birthdate, and government-issued identification documents), and information about your activities and intended use of the Stripe Issuing Accountholder Services. This information may be in addition to information you have previously provided to Stripe in connection with other Services. You must promptly provide all additional financial and other information Stripe requests from time to time.
2.6 Inquiries.
Stripe (or, if applicable, your Platform Provider) will manage all inquiries from Issuing Authorised Users regarding Stripe Issuing Accountholder Services, including inquiries related to the use of Cards, and lost, stolen or damaged Cards.
3. Cards
3.1 Card Design.
You may request specific Card designs for Cards issued to you or Issuing Authorised Users. You must provide all proposed Card designs to Stripe for review and approval using the process Stripe requires. Stripe will review Card design proposals for compliance with this Agreement and Stripe reputational considerations. If Stripe does not approve a proposed Card design, Stripe will recommend modifications that, if made, will meet these requirements. You must resubmit the modified Card design to Stripe for approval using the same process.
3.2 Card Orders.
You may order Cards through your Stripe Dashboard (or, if applicable, through your Platform Provider). At your (or, if applicable, your Platform Provider’s) expense, Stripe will procure and ship (a) Cards based on the information contained in the applicable Card order to the address in the EEA, UK or Switzerland specified in that Card order; and (b) replacements for Cards reported as lost, stolen or damaged. Risk of loss for Cards passes to the recipient (you or your Platform Provider) when Stripe ships the Card to the address specified in the order.
3.3 Card Activation.
You must activate a Card through your Stripe Dashboard (or, if applicable, through your Platform Provider) before you or your Issuing Authorised Users use that Card. Stripe will provide activation instructions to you, either directly or with delivery of Cards. You will provide those instructions to your Stripe Issuing Administrators and Issuing Authorised Users. Once a Card is activated, Issuing Authorised Users may use Cards to initiate Card Transactions on your behalf.
3.4 Ownership and Cancellation of Cards.
Cards are the property of Stripe. If Stripe requests that you or an Issuing Authorised User return a Card, then you must return, or ensure that the Issuing Authorised User returns, that Card promptly to Stripe as Stripe instructs. You will immediately and at your expense return cancelled Cards to Stripe or provide written certification that cancelled Cards have been destroyed.
Stripe may, in its reasonable discretion, cancel, suspend or restrict the use of a Card at any time, including as required by Law or Card Network Rules, or if a Card is used for a Card Unauthorised Purpose. Stripe will notify you as soon as practicable after cancelling, suspending or restricting a Card, and to the extent Law permits, will inform you of the reasons for the cancellation, suspension or restriction. Stripe will issue a replacement Card or lift the suspension or restriction of a Card as soon as practicable after Stripe determines that the reasons for cancellation, suspension or restriction cease to exist.
3.5    User Materials.
You represent as of the date you submit User Materials for a Card to Stripe for review, and warrant at all times during the Term, that you have the necessary rights in the User Materials to use (and grant Stripe the rights to use) the User Materials on the Cards and for the purposes of the Stripe Issuing Program. You grant to Stripe and its Affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to use the User Materials on Cards and applicable Stripe Issuing Program materials. You also grant to Stripe and its Affiliates the right to sublicense these rights to third parties that Stripe engages to create Cards and applicable Stripe Issuing Program materials.
If you terminate or revoke the licence to the User Materials, then (a) Stripe will stop producing new Cards carrying the User Materials and stop using the User Materials for the purposes of the Stripe Issuing Program; (b) Stripe will not be obligated to recall, destroy or replace any existing Cards carrying the User Materials; and (c) Stripe will not be liable for any delay or failure in performing its obligations to the extent they are adversely affected by the termination or revocation.
4. Operation of Stripe Issuing Accounts and Processing of Card Transactions
4.1 Stripe Issuing Accounts.
The Stripe Issuing Account is an E-money Account for which you may request the issuance of Cards. The Stripe Issuing Account will contain sub-accounts (for information purposes only) related to each Card. The Stripe Issuing Account will contain details of Card Transactions processed in respect of each Card, and the outstanding amount of E-money which is held in the Stripe Issuing Account across all Cards issued to you. All Cards issued to you are linked to your Stripe Issuing Account.
4.2 Card Transactions.
Stripe will use a Card Network to authorise, clear, and settle all Card Transactions initiated on your Cards. Stripe may decline to authorise  a Card Transaction or reverse a Card Transaction for any reason, including if (a) Stripe is concerned about the security of the Card or Stripe suspects that the Card is being used without valid authorisation or for a Card Unauthorised Purpose; (b) insufficient E-money is loaded onto the Card; (c) Stripe believes that you are acting in breach of this Agreement or the Connected Account Agreement (if applicable) or any other agreement you may have with a Stripe Entity; (d) Stripe believes the Card Transaction is suspicious, fraudulent, illegal or exposes you, Stripe or others to risks unacceptable to Stripe; (e) there are errors, failures or refusals by merchants, payment processors or payment schemes related to the Card Transaction; or (f) the Card Transaction is with a prohibited or restricted merchant or a merchant operating a Prohibited or Restricted Business. If Stripe declines to authorise a Card Transaction, Stripe will, on request, if practicable and to the extent Law permits, inform you of the reason. Stripe is not responsible for losses, damages or costs you incur arising out of, or relating to, reversed or declined Card Transactions.
4.3 Authorisation of Card Transactions.
Subject to the features of the Card, the authorisation of a Card Transaction may include authorising any single Card Transaction or a series of recurring Card Transactions, or pre-authorising a future Card Transaction for a specified or unspecified amount. Stripe will treat Card Transactions as authorised and consented to by you where Issuing Authorised Users follow the instructions provided by a merchant or Stripe to effectively authorise the Card Transaction at the point of sale (including online), including where the Issuing Authorised User (as applicable) (a) enters a Personal Identification Number (PIN); (b) signs a sales receipt; (c) provides Card and other requested details; (d) taps, waves or swipes the Card at a card reader; or (e) fulfils multi-factor authentication requirements (including strong customer authentication, as defined under Law). Authorisation of a Card Transaction cannot be withdrawn or revoked once received by Stripe.
4.4 Processing of Card Transactions.
Payment order Card Transactions will be received by Stripe at the time Stripe receives the Card Transaction settlement instruction from the relevant Card Network. Stripe will deduct the amount of a Card Transaction from the balance of the Stripe Issuing Account as soon as the Card Transaction is made. When a Card is used to initiate a Card Transaction where the final amount of the Card Transaction is unknown at the time of authorisation, a hold may be placed on available funds in the Stripe Issuing Account for an amount authorised by (or on behalf of) you that is equal to or in excess of the final amount of the Card Transaction. The funds subject to the hold will not be available to you for any other purpose until the merchant or the Card Network releases the hold, or until Stripe receives the final amount of the Card Transaction, or receives the final payment order.
4.5 Card Transaction Settlement.
Stripe will settle Card Transactions, net of fees and amounts owed to Stripe, to the relevant Card Network within the required settlement time frame.
4.6 Currency conversions.
If you pay for goods and services in a currency other than the Denominated Currency, the amount payable will be converted at the relevant Card Network's reference exchange rate at the clearing time of the Card Transaction, and a foreign exchange fee will apply. The Card Network’s reference exchange rate, and a comparison as against the latest available foreign exchange rates issued by the European Central Bank, are outlined by Visa
here
and Mastercard
here
(as may be updated from time to time). When paying in a currency other than the Denominated Currency, the applicable exchange rate will be shown at the time of the Card Transaction.
4.7 Refunds.
You may submit a refund request in relation to Card Transactions where (a) you did not authorise the Card Transaction; (b) the Card Transaction was incorrectly executed and you have notified Stripe in accordance with Section 7 of these Stripe Issuing Accountholder Terms; or (c) the Card Transaction was pre authorised and did not specify the final amount at the time of authorisation, and the amount charged by the merchant is more than you could reasonably have expected taking into account normal spending patterns on the Card or the circumstances of the Card Transaction (a claim for a refund in these circumstances will not be accepted if the amount of the Card Transaction was made available to you at least 4 weeks before the Card Transaction date, or if the claim is made more than 8 weeks after the Card Transaction was debited from the Stripe Issuing Account).
4.8 Card Transaction information.
Stripe (or, if applicable, your Platform Provider) will, through the Stripe Technology, provide you with the Stripe Issuing Account balance and a statement of Card Transactions. You will be able to access and download monthly Card Transaction statements via the Stripe Technology (or, if applicable, from your Platform Provider). The Card Transaction statements will show (a) information related to each Card Transaction which will enable it to be identified and, where appropriate, information on the payee; (b) the amount of the Card Transaction shown in the currency in which the Card Transaction was paid; (c) the amount of charges for the Card Transaction; (d) where applicable, the actual exchange rate applied to the Card Transaction; and (e) the date the Card Transaction is authorised on or posted to the Stripe Issuing Account.
4.9 Authorised TPPs.
You may give appropriately authorised TPPs access to information concerning, and enable those TPPs to make payments from, the Stripe Issuing Account, subject to and in accordance with these Stripe Issuing Accountholder Terms and Law. Stripe may refuse to allow a TPP to access information or your Stripe Issuing Account if Stripe reasonably believes that the TPP is acting on an unauthorised, fraudulent or illegal basis. Unless Law prohibits notification, Stripe will notify you if Stripe takes this action. You will notify Stripe immediately if you believe a payment made through a TPP was unauthorised or incorrect.
5. Loading and redeeming funds
5.1 Loading funds.
You may load funds at par value onto the Stripe Issuing Account using the Stripe Technology via the funding mechanisms Stripe makes available. All funds in the Stripe Issuing Account are safeguarded by Stripe PSP in compliance with Law. You acknowledge and agree that funds in the Stripe Issuing Account are held by Stripe PSP on your behalf and are not deposits. You will not earn any interest on any funds held in the Stripe Issuing Account.
5.2 Redeeming funds.
You may redeem the funds on the Stripe Issuing Account at any time in whole or in part at par value. You are not entitled to a refund of money that has already been spent on or held for authorised Card Transactions. You must request redemptions via the communication methods specified by Stripe (including through the Stripe Technology), specifying the amount of redemption. If you choose to redeem all of the funds on the Stripe Issuing Account, Stripe will cancel the Cards and you will, at your sole expense (a) immediately return the cancelled Cards in your possession or under your control; or (b) provide written certification of destruction of any cancelled or unused Cards. All redeemed funds will be returned to you by bank transfer to a User Bank Account. You will provide Stripe with any documents reasonably requested by Stripe to enable Stripe to process a redemption request.
5.3 Stripe action.
Stripe may prevent you from redeeming funds in the Stripe Issuing Account if Stripe believes your use (or intended use) of the Stripe Issuing Account (a) breaches this Agreement or any other agreement between you and Stripe; (b) is for any Card Unauthorised Purpose; or (c) would expose you, Stripe or others to risks unacceptable to Stripe. Unless restricted by Law, Stripe will notify you as soon as reasonably practicable if Stripe takes that action.
6. Your Obligations and Use of the Cards
6.1 Use of the Cards.
You and your Issuing Authorised Users are permitted to use the Cards for Card Transactions. Cards cannot be used for (a) obtaining cash back at the point of sale; or (b) any Card Unauthorised Purpose. Stripe may, acting reasonably, require you to establish a daily Card Transaction Limit to prevent the risk of loss to Stripe, and to reduce the rate of declined Card Transactions. If a daily Card Transaction Limit is required by Stripe, Stripe may decline any Card Transactions in excess of the daily Card Transaction Limit.
Cards will be valid for the period ending on the expiry date set out on the relevant Card. You may request a replacement Card. Stripe may charge a fee for the issuance of replacement Cards.
You, (or, if applicable, your Platform Provider) may establish limits or restrictions on your Stripe Issuing Account through your Stripe Dashboard, including spend limits on individual Card Transactions, a maximum spend limit in any given period, a limit on the number of cards issued to your Stripe Issuing Account and the types of merchants with which your Cards may be used. You (or, if applicable, your Platform Provider) are responsible for communicating and implementing any limits to your Issuing Authorised Users.
6.2 Issuing Authorised User Servicing.
You (or, if applicable, your Platform Provider) will handle (a) all enquiries regarding Card usage and lost, damaged or stolen Cards; and (b) all other enquiries from Issuing Authorised Users. Stripe will not provide support to Issuing Authorised Users in relation to the Stripe Issuing Services. You may not outsource Issuing Authorised User servicing to any third party.
7. Card Disputes
7.1 Reporting Unauthorised Transactions.
If you believe (a) your Card has been lost or stolen or (b) there are fraudulent or unauthorised transactions on your Card or Stripe Issuing Account, you must immediately, (a) report any unauthorised Card Transactions to Stripe by filing a dispute through the Stripe Dashboard, and (b) cancel any compromised Cards through the Stripe Dashboard. Disputing a fraudulent or unauthorised Card Transaction will not cancel a Card. Failure to cancel any compromised Cards through the Stripe Dashboard may result in you incurring additional liability.
7.2 Reporting Incorrectly Executed Transactions.
If you believe that your Card or Stripe Issuing Account was subject to an incorrectly executed or otherwise erroneous charge, you may contact the merchant to resolve the dispute regarding the relevant Card Transaction. If you are unable to resolve the dispute with the merchant, then you must file the dispute through your Stripe Dashboard. You must file disputes related to any incorrectly executed, erroneous or disputed Card Transactions to Stripe within 13 months (or within the timeframe required by Law) from the date the Card Transaction appears on your Stripe Issuing Account.
7.3 Determining Incorrectly Executed Transactions.
When you report and submit an erroneous, incorrectly executed or unauthorised Card Transaction through the Stripe Dashboard, Stripe will evaluate the submitted information in accordance with Law and the Card Network Rules. If Stripe determines, in its sole discretion, that the dispute of the Card Transaction is valid or the Card Transaction was erroneous, incorrectly executed or unauthorised, Stripe will credit the amount of the applicable Card Transaction back to your Stripe Issuing Account. If Stripe fully or partially credits the amount of any Card Transaction to your Stripe Issuing Account, you agree to transfer (and execute any necessary agreements to effect the transfer) to Stripe all claims (excluding tort claims) that you may have against the merchant for the Card Transaction.
7.4 Liability for Unauthorised Card Transactions.
Stripe will reimburse you for any card dispute where Stripe determines that neither you nor a Card Authorised User authorised the underlying Card Transaction, provided that (a) you will be liable for the first €50 or £35 (as applicable) of any card dispute where Stripe reasonably believes you should have been aware that the Card was lost or stolen; (b) Stripe will not be liable for any card dispute where (i) you or a Card Authorised User used a Card for a Card Unauthorised Purpose or either intentionally or negligently, failed to use the Card in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Stripe Issuing Program Guidelines; or (ii) you failed to immediately notify Stripe of the Card becoming lost, stolen or misappropriated (in accordance with Section 8 of these Stripe Issuing Accountholder Terms).
If Stripe reimburses you for a card dispute and subsequently determines that the relevant Card Transaction was duly authorised and correctly executed, Stripe may recoup or set off an amount equal to that reimbursed amount from your Stripe Issuing Account.
8. Card Security.
8.1 Securing Cards and Account Data.
You must secure Cards and Personal Data in your possession or control, and you must ensure that your Issuing Authorised Users secure Cards and Personal Data in their possession or control. When stored or processed digitally, you must use appropriate organisational, physical and technical measures to secure Cards and Personal Data in your and your Issuing Authorised Users’ possession or control, including through the use of industry-standard encryption and anti-fraud measures. You must monitor for any suspicious or unauthorised activities and fraud on your Stripe Issuing Account and each Card.
8.2 Unauthorised Transactions.
To the extent Law permits, you are responsible for Card Transactions, and fees and penalties you or Stripe incur resulting from any Issuing Authorised User’s failure to (a) exercise reasonable care in safeguarding Cards from loss, theft or misappropriation; or (b) promptly report loss or theft, including fraud.
To the extent Law permits, if you or an Issuing Authorised User allows another party to use the Card or Personal Data for any purpose or if an unauthorised person uses a Card or Personal Data, you will be liable for that use, including all losses, damages and costs arising out of or relating to that use. To the extent Law permits, Stripe is not liable for any losses, damages or costs to you or your Issuing Authorised Users arising out of or relating to (y) unauthorised access to or use of a Card or your Stripe Issuing Account; or (z) your failure to use or implement anti-fraud measures, security controls or any other data security measures.
9. Stripe Issuing Program Fees
9.1 Stripe Issuing Program Fees.
Stripe will provide the Stripe Issuing Services to you at the rates and for the fees described on the Stripe Pricing Page unless you and Stripe otherwise agree in writing.

Stripe provides Issuing Authorised Users' Personal Data to third-party service providers, including third parties engaged for Card printing services, and their respective Affiliates, as well as to Stripe’s Affiliates, to enable Stripe to provide the Stripe Issuing Program.
