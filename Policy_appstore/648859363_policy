Your rights and choices
We discuss the rights and choices you have with regards to the personal data that we hold about you, and suggest some resources which may be useful to you
Managing your marketing choices
We’ll send relevant offers and news about our products and services to you, for example by email, but only if you’ve agreed to receive them. It’s easy to change your mind though. If you want to stop (or start) receiving them, here's how you can do so:
Log in to your Tesco account
Click on the 'Your Account' tab
Click 'Your Contact Preferences'
Or, you can visit our 'contact us' page and we'll be happy to help you make any changes to your account

What data we hold about you
You have a right to find out what personal data we hold about you and how we use it. This is called a subject access request.
Subject access request
You also have the right for some of your personal data to be “transferred” or “ported”. This is called a data portability request.
Data portability request

Have inaccurate information corrected
If you believe we hold inaccurate or missing information, please let us know and we'll correct it
Object to our use of it
General objection – We’ll consider your objection to our use of your personal data. If on balance, your rights outweigh our interests in using your personal data, then we will at your request, either restrict our use of it or delete it.

Objection in relation to direct marketing – If you make such an objection, we will stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Restrict our use of it
You can restrict our use of your personal data if you have: successfully made a general objection; you’re challenging the accuracy of the data we hold or if we’ve used your personal data unlawfully.
Have us delete it
There are several situations when you can have us delete your personal data, this includes (but is not limited to):

•	we no longer need to keep your personal data
•	you have successfully made a general objection
•	you have withdrawn your consent to us using your personal data (and we do not have any other grounds to use it)
•	we have unlawfully processed your personal data
Complain to the data protection regulator
We’d like the chance to resolve any complaints you may have, however you also have the right to complain to the UK data protection regulator (the “ICO”) about how we have used your personal data. [https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/raising-concerns]

Their website also contains useful information about your privacy rights.
