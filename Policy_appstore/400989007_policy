Advanced encryption keeps your data safe in transit
Encryption brings a higher level of security and privacy to our services. When you send an email, share a video, visit a website or store your photos, the data that you create moves between your device, Google services and our data centres. We protect this data with multiple layers of security, including leading encryption technology such as HTTPS and Transport Layer Security.
Proactive security alerts help protect your private information
We’ll proactively notify you if we detect something that we think you should know about – like a suspicious login or a malicious website, file or app – and we’ll provide guidance to help you stay better protected. When we detect something suspicious in your account, we’ll send a notification to your inbox or phone so that you can protect your account with one click.
Threats detected and blocked automatically
Safe Browsing protects four billion devices every day, including yours. To make the Internet safer for everyone, we made this technology available free of cost for other companies to use in their browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox. So you’re protected as you browse on Google and beyond.
Easy-to-use privacy tools
that
put you in control.
Control what data is saved to your Google Account
When it comes to privacy, we know one size does not fit all. That’s why we help you choose the privacy settings that are right for you. Whether you want to save, delete or auto-delete your data, we give you the tools to do it.
