Launcher Privacy Policy
Last Updated: September 12, 2022
We take privacy seriously here at Cromulent Labs. And we know that you don't want to wade
        through a bunch of legalese, so here is our privacy policy in plain English.
BASICS
We are not spammers and
we will never sell your information to any third party ever
. All information that
        we obtain from you through the use of our service is used in order to provide basic functionality or 
        enhance your experience of our product.
DATA WE COLLECT
Apple Identifiers
We send several unique identifiers for the app to our servers and store them so that we can 
        track how many different people have installed our app. Note that all of these identifiers are 
        resettable by you and none of them identify you in any way and we do not use any device-level identifiers. The identifiers we use are: 
        1) A unique identifier generated for the app, 2) The IdentifierForVendor which is a unique ID generated by
        iOS for all Cromulent Labs applications, 3) A push notification token for sending you push notifications.
Contact List, Calendar and Photos
If you choose to allow access to your contact list, calendar, or photos, your contacts, calendar events and photos are kept private
        on your device and are only used to help you create new launchers. None of this data is sent to our
        servers or seen by us.
Apps
Apps are sandboxed on iOS which means that one app cannot see information in another app. So there is no 
        way for Launcher to see any information in any apps that you add to Launcher.
We track which apps are used to set up launchers to determine popularity of launchers and enhance the 
        experience of the app, but this information is aggregated and not associated with any unique identifiers.
Location
If you choose to give Launcher access to your location, it is only used to set up and run certain widgets and launchers.
        However, if you set up certain
        magic launchers, the device location (and only the location, no unique identifiers are included) will be sent 
        to the following third parties in order to perform their intended functions:
Apple Maps
or
Google Maps
for ETA magic launchers,
Apple Weather
for 
        weather magic launchers and
Uber
for Uber magic launchers. Weather requests may be proxied through our servers for backward-compatibility, but the location isn't used or stored by us, except temporarily in logs that are rotated and deleted after 30 days.
THIRD PARTY SDKS
Flurry
We use the Flurry SDK for analytics. Flurry may collect information about your device
        and activities within our application in order to provide us with aggregate information that we can use
        to enhance your experience. We do not send any of the information we collect from you to Flurry, but 
        they may collect information via their SDK. We specifically disable their ability to collect your exact location.
You can view Flurry's privacy policy here:
https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/legal-privacy/terms-service/
Crashlytics/Firebase
We use Crashlytics to report to us when the app crashes so that we can fix these crashes as soon as possible. 
	We don't send any user information to Crashlytics, but they may collect information via their SDK.
You can view Crashlytics' privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
Setapp
We use the Setapp SDK to enable features for Setapp subscribers.
	We don't send any user information to Setapp, but they may collect information via their SDK.
You can view Setapp's privacy policy here:
https://setapp.com/privacy-policy
INFORMATION PROTECTION
Cromulent Labs uses reasonable efforts to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access 
	and unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. However, we cannot guarantee that your personal 
	information will be absolutely protected. For example, your personal information may be affected by actions 
	outside of our control, such as computer "hacking" and physical theft. You acknowledge that you provide your 
	personal information at your own risk.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post all changes to this Privacy Policy 
        on this page and will indicate at the top of the page the modified policy's effective date.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google

Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Inactive Account Manager
allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.
And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:
Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like
Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.
Legal bases of processing
We process your information for the
purposes
described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
We process your data in order to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract.
We process your data for our legitimate interests and those of
third parties
while applying
appropriate safeguards
that protect your privacy.
We process your data when necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person.
We process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so.
We ask for your consent to process your data for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more

You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Data Collection & Processing
We may collect personal data directly from an individual or automatically when an individual interacts

Payment information
Payment information provided by you via Setapp, Services, Site will be stored and processed by third-party
                payment service providers as designated by us from time to time. We will collect certain information on
                the Site, via Setapp and Services, those are required for such third-party payment services providers to
                process payments, including credit/debit card numbers, security numbers and other related payment
                information.
When you make a payment on Setapp, our services, or site, your payment details are stored and handled by
                another company that we pick. We collect some info needed for them to process your payment, like your
                credit or debit card numbers.
All such information is subject to the privacy policy of such third-party payment service providers as
                applicable.
That other company has their own privacy policy, which covers your payment details.
Requests via Setapp
We use information processed from Setapp to respond to users’ requests. We do not sell, rent, lease, trade
                or share users’ personal information other than as outlined in this Privacy Policy. When you provide us
                with your personal information or otherwise choose to sign up to receive email communications from us, we
                will use that information to send those communications to you. Individuals may “opt out” of receiving
                email communications through links available on emails received or by contacting us.
We use the stuff we know about you from Setapp to answer your questions. We won't sell, rent or share your
                personal info in ways we didn't tell you in our Privacy Policy aka rule book. If you give us your personal
                info or sign up to get emails from us, we'll use that info to send you those emails. If you don't want the
                emails anymore, there's a link in every email where you can say "no more emails, please!" or you can tell
                us directly.
Data Retention
Where we act as the controller of the data, such as where we use personal information for MacPaw’s own
                independent purpose of the activity, we will retain your information for the necessary period of time that
                it serves the purpose for which it was originally processed or subsequently authorised and in accordance
                with applicable law. Namely, but not exclusively, we retain Your data to maintain and expand our
                relationship and provide you with our services and offerings; in order to comply with our legal and
                contractual obligations; or to protect ourselves from any potential disputes (i.e. as required by laws
                applicable to log-keeping, records and bookkeeping, and in order to have proof and evidence concerning our
                relationship, should any legal issues arise following your discontinuance of use), all in accordance with
                our internal policies and applicable laws.
Sometimes we, at MacPaw, need to keep some of your personal information. We only keep it for as long as we
                need it. We might need to keep it to help us offer you our services, to do what the law says, or to keep
                things safe and fair.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
                personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and the applicable legal requirements.
We think about what info we have, what it's about, how sensitive it is, if there's any risk of it being
                used wrongly, why we need it, and what the law says to decide how long we keep it.
We delete, block or anonymize the personal data of the data subject as soon as the purpose of the storage
                is fulfilled.
Once we don't need it anymore, we make sure to delete it, or make it so nobody knows it was about you.
Data Storage And Transfers
We use data centers that store Setapp, Services, Site and databases, IT service providers that maintain
                our systems, and consulting companies. Therefore, for the date of acceptance of the Terms of Use and
                acknowledgment of this Privacy Policy by You, the information submitted to MacPaw can be transferred to,
                processed, and stored in the United States of America, the countries of the European Union and Ukraine.
                Data stored and processed by MacPaw may sometimes be moved between these zones (in a secure manner). If
                you post or transfer any information to or through our Product, you are agreeing to such information,
                including Personal Data, being hosted and accessed in the United States of America; the countries of the
                European Union and Ukraine.
We use special computer storages to keep Setapp, our services, our website, and databases. These storages
                can be in places like America, Europe, and Ukraine. We might need to move some info between these places,
                but it's always done safely. When you use our stuff, you're okay with us storing and accessing your info
                in these places.
MacPaw may use services of other providers that are partly located in third countries (outside the
                European Union or the European Economic Area). Where this is the case, and there is no adequacy decision
                for these countries, MacPaw undertakes to take appropriate precautions to ensure an adequate level of data
                protection for any data transfers. These include, among others, the standard contractual clauses in force
                at the time of transfer of data, or binding internal data protection regulations.
Sometimes, we use services from other companies outside of the European Union or the European Economic
                Area. When we do, we ensure there's enough protection for any info that moves.
If a third country transfer is provided for and no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards are in
                place, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the respective third country (e.g.
                intelligence services) may gain access to the transferred data in order to collect and analyze it, and
                that enforceability of your data subject rights cannot be guaranteed.
But, in some cases, authorities from these places might be able to look at the info, and we can't always
                guarantee they won't.
However, we will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of personal data is carefully
                managed to protect your rights and interests. Data transfers to service providers and other third parties
                are protected by contractual obligations and, where appropriate, by other guarantees, such as standard
                contractual terms issued by the European Commission or certification schemes.
Don't worry, we always manage any movement of your info carefully to protect your rights. We protect these
                transfers with contracts, and if needed, other safeguards like standard contractual terms by the European
                Commission or certificates.
Data Disclosures
We disclose personal data in the following ways:
Developers
We may transfer our email addresses to Developers only after receiving your consent for such a transfer.
                In all other situations, we do not disclose Your personal information to Developers. For example, you can
                log in to Developers’ websites with your Setapp account. Developers will receive your personal data only
                when you have consented to sharing your personal data with them, i.e., authorise them to access your data
                at Setapp.
We might share your email address with developers if you say it's okay. Besides that, we don't share your
                personal info with them. For example, when you log into a developer's website with your Setapp account,
                they'll only get your details if you've said they can.
Service Providers
We engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf or
                complementary to our own. Such service providers include hosting and server co-location services, data

                services, web and product analytics, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, session or activity

                depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services, and may
                only use the data as determined in our agreements with them.
We work with certain trusted companies and individuals to help us out or add to what we do. These helpers
                might need to look at your personal info depending on their job in helping and improving our services, but
                they only use it the way we have agreed.Right now, our helpers include companies that handle things like
                data storage, keeping data secure, billing, payments, spotting fraud, analysing how our services are used,

Service Integrations
You may choose to integrate Setapp with third-party services or applications. The provider of this
                integrated third-party service may receive certain Personal Data about your use of Setapp and Services, or
                share certain Personal Data from your account on the third-party provider’s service with Setapp, depending
                on the nature and purpose of such integration. This could include your personal data. We will take care of
                such your data and store it securely.
You can choose to connect Setapp with services or apps from other companies. The company providing this
                connected service might get some info about how you use Setapp and our services, or share some info from
                your account on their service with us. This could include your personal info. Don't worry, we'll look
                after this info and keep it safe.
Legal Compliance
We may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your personal data, in
                response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with
                applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that:
We might share your personal info or let government and law officials look at it if we get a legal
                request, like a subpoena, search warrant or court order, or to follow the laws. We would only do this if
                we honestly believe:
(a) we are legally compelled to do so;
(b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action
                regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or
(c) such disclosure is required to protect our legitimate business interests, including the security or
                integrity of our products and services.
(a) we have to legally,
(b) it's the right thing to do when looking into, stopping, or acting on actual or suspected illegal
                activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing, or
(c) we need to do it to protect our honest business interests, like keeping our products and services
                safe and sound.
Protecting Rights and Safety
We may share personal data with others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights,
                property or personal safety of Setapp, Services, Site, any of our users, or any members of the general
                public.
We might share your personal info with others if we really believe it can help keep Setapp, our services,
                our website, our users, or everyone else safe.
MacPaw’s Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies
We may share personal data internally within our group, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
                In addition, should MacPaw or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates undergo any change in control or
                ownership, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all or part of its
                assets, personal data may be shared with or transferred to the parties involved in such an event. We may
                disclose personal data to a third-party during negotiation of, in connection with or as an asset in such a
                corporate business transaction. Personal data may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy
                or receivership.
We might share your personal info within our group of companies for the reasons we've mentioned in this
                Privacy Policy. Also, if MacPaw or any of our companies changes hands or goes through big changes, like
                merging with another company, we might share or move your personal info to the parties involved. This
                could also happen if the company becomes insolvent, bankrupt, or taken over.
For the avoidance of doubt, MacPaw may share personal data in additional manners, pursuant to your
                explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data
                non-personal, non-identifiable and anonymous. We may transfer, share or otherwise use non-personal and
                non-identifiable data at our sole discretion and without the need for further approval.
Just to be clear, we might share your personal info in other ways, if you say it's okay, if the law says
                we have to, or if we've made it impossible to tell who the info is about. We can transfer, share, or use
                info that doesn't identify anyone without needing further approval.
Safeguards
When You give Us personal data, We take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely.
When you give us your personal information, we work hard to keep it safe.
Non-sensitive details (Your email address etc.) are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be
                guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while We strive to protect personal data, We cannot guarantee
                the security of any personal data users transmit to Us, and You do so at Your own risk. Once We receive
                personal data, We make Our best effort to ensure its security on Our systems.
Simple things like your email address are sent over the internet, but we can't guarantee it's completely
                secure. So, while we try our best to protect your information, there's still a risk when you send it to
                us.
We use industry-standard encryption to protect personal data in transit. This is commonly referred to as
                transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.

Data Breaches
All breaches will be reported to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours after becoming aware
                of such breaches if such breach has a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, and unless the
                data was anonymised or encrypted.
If there's a breach that could harm people's privacy, we'll tell the right authority within 72 hours,
                unless the data was made safe.
Breaches of this Privacy Policy by staff, contractors, officers of MacPaw will be dealt with under
                MacPaw’s grievance and disciplinary policy and may lead to a disciplinary sanction.
If our own people break these rules, they'll face consequences according to our company's policy.
