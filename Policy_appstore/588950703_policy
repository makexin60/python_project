2. Processing of Personal Data
We collect, process and use personal data (in accordance with the definitions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG)) in order to provide our Jimdo Creator App services.
2.1 Creation of a website
When creating a Jimdo website via the Jimdo Creator App the user must provide a valid email address. The email address is used to create and administer the Jimdo Creator App user’s account and to enable the user to use the Jimdo Creator App. The Jimdo users' website shall be published under a subdomain name of the Jimdo website address that shall either be chosen by the Jimdo user or generated automatically. The legal basis is that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 b GDPR.
The data submitted by the Jimdo user shall be saved until the termination of the user’s account, i.e. until the deletion of the Jimdo Creator App. Exception: Due to tax regulations we are obliged to save billing information for a period of 10 years.
2.2 Information regarding the use of the websites created by Jimdo users
When users are logged into their Jimdo website via the Jimdo Creator App, the Jimdo server automatically collects and composes an activity log which logs the way in which Jimdo is used. This log includes information regarding the activity (including used storage space, number of logins, etc.), statistical data (such as e.g. browser type, date and time of access) as well as the IP address of the Jimdo-user.
The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website. A transfer to third parties or other use of the data does not take place. However, we reserve the right to retrospectively check the server log files if there are concrete indications of illegal activities. This data will be anonymized and deleted where appropriate at the latest after a period of 7 days.
2.3 Third Party Services
Google Analytics SDK for iOS
The Jimdo Creator app uses Google Analytics SDK for iOS, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google") Jimdo uses Google Analytics to improve the performance of our Jimdo Creator app and to prevent misuse of our services.
Google Analytics SDK for iOS uses the Google Analytics API, which allows an analysis of the use of this app by the Jimdo Creator App user. The information generated by the tracking code about the use of this app is transmitted to a server of Google in the USA and stored there.
However, due to the use of IP anonymization by Google, the IP address of the Jimdo Creator App user is shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of Jimdo, Google will use this information to evaluate the use of the app by the Jimdo Creator app user, to compile reports on the app's activities and to provide other app-related services to the app operator.
The IP address provided by Google Analytics within this app will not be merged with other data provided by Google. Furthermore, Jimdo has entered into a Data Processing Agreement with Google, in which Google has committed itself to protect the data of our customers.
The legal basis for the use of the following processors is a consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR, § 25 para. 1 German Telecommunications-Telemedia-Data-Protection-Act (TTDSG). The user can revoke his consent at any time with effect for the future by opening the cookie settings and deactivating Google Analytics.

Firebase
Firebase is a product of Google Inc (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, „Google“). In order to guarantee the functionality of the Jimdo Creator App Jimdo utilizes the following Firebase functions:
Firebase Cloud Messaging
We use the Firebase Cloud Messaging service to send push messages or so-called in-app messages to the Jimdo Creator App user on their device. If the Jimdo Creator App user uses our apps through a push-enabled device, they can agree on device level to receive push notifications.
In this case, the terminal is assigned a pseudonymized device token ID, a unique connection number generated from the device ID, by which Jimdo can address the push messages or in-app messages to the Jimdo Creator App users. Consent to the push message notification can be changed at any time in the settings of the Jimdo Creator App.
The legal basis for processing data for this service is your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR, § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. We concluded Standard Contractual Clause (SCC) with Google to ensure privacy requirements are met. The Subprocessors that Google uses can be found here:
https://firebase.google.com/terms/subprocessors
More information about Firebase Cloud Messaging can be found here:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/
Firebase Analytics for Android
The Jimdo Creator App uses Firebase Analytics for Android devices to improve the performance of our Jimdo Creator app and to analyze usage data, whereby technical usage data is processed (e.g., IP address of your device, installation data, such as the app version and the time of installation, information about the content and functions you use, information about clicks, the duration of use, and information about your device, such as device model and operating system). The information is collected pseudonymously using so-called identifiers, e.g. in the form of the Android Ad ID. This is used to evaluate the use of the Creator App and to create statistical reports on usage behavior.
The legal basis for the use of Firebase Analytics is your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR, § 25 para. 1 TDDSG. Jimdo has entered into standard contractual clauses (SCC) with Google to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
You can find more information about Firebase Analytics here:
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/
.
Firebase Remote Config
We also use Firebase Remote Config, which allows us to run A / B tests and customize the behavior and appearance of the app without having to download a new version. Personal data is not stored.
The legal basis for the use and analysis of the data and use of Firebase is our legitimate interest (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our apps) within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, § 25 para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG. We concluded Standard Contractual Clause (SCC) with Google to ensure privacy requirements are met. The Subprocessors that Google uses can be found here:
https://firebase.google.com/terms/subprocessors
More information can be found here:
https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy
.
Firebase Crashlytics
We use Firebase Crashlytics, which allows you to send error reports after the Jimdo Creator App crashes. When the App crashes, information about it will be sent to Google, this includes the type of device, system on the device and technical data about the device (so-called error Report).
The legal basis for using Crashlytics is your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR, § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. Jimdo concluded Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) with Google to ensure privacy requirements are met. The Subprocessors that Google uses can be found here:

Amazon S3
When the user uploads images or files to his Jimdo website, these files shall be uploaded to the cloud services of Amazon S3 (whose servers are located in Ireland). This is a service by Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg. The legal basis for processing the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest is to store your data appropriately.
The privacy policy for Amazon can be found here:
https://aws.amazon.com/de/privacy/
.
Fastly
We use Fastly, Inc. to deliver the content of your Jimdo website including the web fonts (CDN Service). Fastly, Inc. ensures that your website can be quickly accessed from all over the world. This is a service by Fastly, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, PO Box 78266, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. The legal basis for processing the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

3. Data transmission to third countries
Jimdo ensures that your data is processed in the EU or in the European Economic Area. Should this no longer be possible and data needs to be transferred to a third country, Jimdo will ensure, after prior review, that an adequate level of data protection that meets the requirements of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the EU Commission is adhered to in the country the data is transferred to. In these cases, the data is transferred on the basis of an Adequacy Decision of the European Commission or the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transmission of personal data to third countries in its current valid version. These can be accessed

Data transmission to a third country may also take place on the basis of your consent. You will be provided with details of this separately, if applicable.
4. Period of storage
Insofar as we receive and process your personal data for the purposes of implementing, initiating, and processing your contract with Jimdo, we store it until the purpose of storage has been achieved (in particular achieved in the event of the contract being terminated), or insofar as this is required within the statutory retention periods in accordance with section 257 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and section 147 of the German Tax Code (AO).
We store HTTP data and server log files for a maximum of three (3) months unless there is a security incident (such as a DDoS attack). In the event of a security incident, server log files will be stored until the incident has been rectified and fully investigated.

Version
We are delighted that you are interested in working for Jimdo and have applied or will apply for a position in our company. We would like to provide you with the following information on the processing of your personal data in connection with your job application.
Who is the responsible party (the controller) for the processing of your application?
Jimdo GmbH
Stresemannstraße 375
2276 Hamburg
Germany privacy@jimdo.com
You will find more information about our company, information on the persons authorized to represent Jimdo and also, further contact options on the contact page of our website:
https://www.jimdo.com/info/legal-notice/
What data do we process and for what purpose?
We process the data that you send us in connection with and via your job application in order to check your suitability for the position (or possibly for other open positions in our company) and of course, to carry out the application process. Your data will be used exclusively for processing your application and deciding whether to establish an employment relationship.
This includes:
Your name, e-mail address, telephone number and other contact information,
Your resume, cover letters, information on education, job references and all other data you send to us during the application process.
Any further Information given to us by you during any application interviews
We also process data from publicly available sources, including online, that we believe is relevant to your application or a potential future application, such as your Linkedin Profile.
What is the legal basis for the processing?
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the job application process is primarily Article 26 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) i.e. Data processing for employment related purposes. In accordance with Article 26 BDSG, the processing of the data required in connection with the decision to establish an employment relationship is permitted. Insofar as the data are special categories of personal data (such as data about your health) that you yourself provide to us (for example, information about a severely disabled status), the processing is carried out on the legal basis of Article 9 (2) b General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in conjunction with Section 26 (3) BDSG.
Where it is relevant, suitable, necessary and proportionate in order to fully assess the applicant's professional suitability for a specific position and where it is objectively relevant to the nature of the position to be filled, Jimdo may request that the applicant submit to a background check. The legal basis for this processing is either Art (6) (1) (c) GDPR (Consent, which can be revoked at any time via email/letter/call for the future) and/or  Art 6(1)(b) GDPR and Art. 26 BDSG where it is necessary for the establishment of an employment relationship and/or where Jimdo has a legitimate interest in conducting the background check, such as ensuring the safety and security of its employees, customers, or property. The candidate will be informed of the applicable legal basis via the job application.
In all cases, Jimdo ensures that appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects are implemented and documented. The data resulting from background checks is exclusively used for the purpose of determining a candidate’s suitability for a post and Jimdo always approaches the interpretation of such information with caution and recognizes that individuals can possess a wide range of personal characteristics regardless of their criminal history. Additionally, Jimdo always considers the context of any past offenses and as a rule allows candidates the opportunity to provide context or mitigating factors.
Pursuant to Section 35 (2) sentence 1 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and Article 17 of the GDPR, you are entitled to have your personal data stored by us deleted at any time. However, we are required by law to retain certain applicant data for a certain period of time (maximum 6 months). Such statutory retention periods follow from the German General Equal Treatment Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz - "AGG"). For this reason, the BDSG restricts your right to have your data deleted in Section 35 para. 3 no. 1 BDSG. This means that your personal data, which must be retained by law, cannot be deleted, but your data will be blocked in accordance with data protection law and subsequently deleted as soon as the recommended statutory retention period (a maximum of 6 months) has expired. Of course, we have deleted all of your data for which there is no legal obligation to retain it. If the data is required for legal prosecution after completing the application process, the data processing shall be based on Section 24 para. 1 no.2 BDSG.
In the event that you have consented to the further storage of your personal data, we will transfer your data to our applicant pool. There, the data will be deleted after two years or alternatively upon your request to recruitment@jimdo.com. The legal basis in this case shall be Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR, i.e. based on your consent.
How long do we store your data?
Where no employment relationship results from the application, the data of the applicant will be deleted after 6 months.
If an employment relationship with Jimdo results from the application process, the data from the applicant data system will be transferred to our personnel & human resources information system, if this is necessary for the creation of the employment relationship. The legal basis for processing this data is Section 26 (1) BDSG.
Who do we share the applicant data with?
Use of Application Management System We use an Application Management System to support our application process.
We have entered into a data processing agreement with our Application Management System, which includes Standard Contractual Clauses. This is a contract in which the Application Management System undertakes to protect the data of our applicants, to process their privacy policy on our behalf, and in particular not to disclose it to third parties. By submitting your application via the Application Management System you automatically use its services. Your data can be deleted at any time.
Your application data will be viewed by the Personnel/Human Resources department upon receipt of your application. Suitable applications are then potentially forwarded internally to the department/Team heads for the respective open position. Then the further procedure is coordinated. As a matter of principle, only the persons in the company who need access to your data for the proper execution of our application process have access to your data.
AI Notetaking Services
We use AI Notetaking Services during application interviews. These are used so the recruiter can focus on you and the interview instead of manual note-taking.
The AI Notetaking Service will only be used with the applicant’s consent and on a voluntary basis. The interviewer will ask for your consent for the use of the AI Notetaking Service at the beginning of the interview. If you do not agree with the use of this service, please note that this will not have a negative impact on the application process.
We have entered into a data processing agreement with the AI Notetaking Service Provider which includes Standard Contractual Clauses. This is a contract in which the service provider undertakes to protect the data of our applicants, to process their privacy online on our behalf, and in particular, not to disclose it to third parties.
Any notes taken by the AI Notetaking Service during the application process will be reviewed by the Personnel/Human Resources Department and the respective interviewers and potentially forwarded to the Department Heads/Team Heads for the respective open position.
Video Conference Call
Jimdo is a remote-first company with a workforce distributed all around the globe. For this reason, interviews may necessarily be conducted via video conference call or alternatively, via telephone.
Should you not wish to conduct the interview via video conference call and/ or via telephone, this will not have a negative impact on the application process. In that case, please contact us directly via recruitment@jimdo.com.
Jimdo has entered into standard contractual clauses with the Video Conference Call provider in order to ensure the security of any data processed within the framework of the application process, by this service.
Technical Skill Test Services
Please note that in the recruitment process for some positions we use certain services to assess technical skills of applicants. Those services transmit data to Jimdo on the results of technical tests. The data collected includes: name, last name, duration of the test session, the answers that applicants provide for the questions. This data is not passed on to third parties and the services serve as a tool to evaluate the applicant's knowledge of the technologies that are used at Jimdo. By starting the technical skill evaluation, you agree to the processing of your data by the Technical Skill Test Service Provider.
We have signed a data processing agreement with the providers. Should you not wish to use such Technical Skill Test Services, please send us your availability directly via email to jobs@jimdo.com and please be aware that this will not have a negative impact on the application process.
Your Rights
You have the right to information about the processing of your personal data by Jimdo (Article 15 GDPR). We are happy to inform you as to what personal information we have saved on you. This information is free, shall be processed immediately and is usually transmitted to you via Email in a secured manner (also via post upon request). In order to receive applicable and detailed information, please provide us with specifications as to the personal data or type thereof concerned(where possible). In order to ensure that the person requesting the aforementioned information is the person they present themselves to be, we may require a proof of identity. This can be in the form of a copied identification document. Please blacken out or remove serial numbers and passport numbers from such copies. These copies shall only be used for the purpose of identification and for the processing of your request.
Furthermore, you have a right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR) or deletion (Art. 17 GDPR) or restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR), as far as you are legally entitled. Furthermore, you have the right to object to the processing within the scope of the legal requirements. The same applies to a right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR). To exercise any of these rights, please simply email us at recruitment@jimdo.com
Our Data Protection Officer
Jimdo has appointed an external Data Protection Officer pursuant to Art. 37 GDPR whom you can reach via E-Mail: Privacy@jimdo.com.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority concerning the processing of your personal data by Jimdo. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority at your usual place of residence or our company headquarters (Hamburg) for this purpose.
Modifications to this Privacy Policy
Due to the further development of our application process or the implementation of new functions or technologies and/or due to legal requirements, it may be necessary to change this policy. We reserve the right to make corresponding changes at any time. In the case of significant changes where the rights of Jimdo applicants could be affected, we shall communicate these changes to you in advance (for example via an email) and where applicable inform you as to the available redress procedures.
As a general note, please be aware that in the event of any deviations resulting from the translation, the formulation of this policy set forth in the
German version
shall prevail.

When you access our website and have been informed accordingly, we collect information about your use of our website using a web analysis tool we developed and store this in a pseudonymous profile. This allows us to improve our website. Jimdo's web analysis tool logs your email address and the user agent, collates these together, and truncates and stores this data using the hash function. A visitor identifier is generated in this way. We also encrypt the visitor identifier using a random value, the salt, which changes every 24 hours.

This data is stored in cookies on your device (see our ) and may be read when you visit our website. During your visit to our website, we may recognize your device on the basis of the ID that was allocated to it. The aim of the analysis is to discover where the users of our website come from, what areas of our website they visit, and how often and how long they view which pages and categories.

V. Marketing
We process your personal data for the purposes of sending you a personalized newsletter, recognizing you on another website, tracking the success of our ads (conversion tracking), showing you targeted advertising for our products ((re)targeting), and for surveys.
Detailed information about this can be found below:
Personalized newsletter
You can register for our email newsletter on our website. We also send the newsletter to our customers. Our newsletter provides you with information about Jimdo's products, services and promotions, surveys, prize draws, blog articles, and other similar content. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time using the unsubscribe link contained in every newsletter. We process certain data in connection with this when we send and analyze the success of our newsletter.
We may reconstruct individual functionalities (such as using behavioral data) of our newsletter to understand which content in our newsletter is particularly interesting to Jimdo users. We will only use the results of these analyses for the purposes of improving our services and designing our services to better meet your requirements as well as for targeting purposes. The newsletter, therefore, contains a "web beacon", which is a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server, or, if applicable, the server of an analysis service provider when the newsletter is opened. Technical information, such as browser and system information, as well as IP address and the time of the retrieval is collected as part of this process. This information is used to improve the technical performance of our services using the technical data, or the target groups and reading behavior based on the access location (which can be determined using the IP address), or the time of access. Statistical data that is also collected includes determining whether the newsletter has been opened when it was opened, how long it was opened for, and which links were clicked on. From a technical perspective, it may be possible to assign this information to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is not our goal to analyze individual users. Rather, these analyses help us to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to our users, or to send them different content in accordance with their interests.
You may object to or withdraw your consent to the storage and usage of your data for sending the newsletter at any time with future effect without needing to give reasons, without being penalized in any way, and without paying any cost for this other than the transmission costs for sending the objection/withdrawal. This can be done by clicking the unsubscribe link in the newsletter, which can be found at the end of every newsletter. Alternatively, you can deselect the "Newsletter" box in your customer account.
Your consent to statistical analysis will also be withdrawn at the same time. It is unfortunately not possible to just object to the statistical analysis in our newsletter. The lawfulness of the data processing operations remains unaffected by the withdrawal of your consent. In the event that you withdraw your consent, the personal data used for this data processing will be anonymized or erased. Data that we store for other purposes (such as email addresses for the member area) is not affected by this.
We process
contact data, newsletter form HTTP data, newsletter subscription data, newsletter tracking pixel data, and newsletter profile data.
The legal basis for sending the newsletter in conjunction with a purchase of Jimdo's goods or services is Art. 13 (2) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC.). It is also possible to send the Jimdo newsletter on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO).
We transfer your data to the following categories of recipients as part of this processing: Newsletter dispatch service providers, newsletter analysis service providers. We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section C.
Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.
Using conversion tracking
We use conversion tracking technology on our website if you have given your consent. Conversions are certain user activities defined by us on our website. Conversion tracking is a method for us to gauge what happens after you have interacted with our ads in search engines or on other websites. For example, we can see whether you subsequently carried out a certain action on our website.
If you are shown our ads in search engines or on other websites or you interact with our adverts we can gather information from this and store it in a device profile. A unique ID is allocated to your device in order to assign this information to your device. We can then link this with your device profile. This ID can be stored using cookies (see our ). This processing takes place, if applicable, dependent on your consent given to the respective operator of the website.
If you subsequently visit our website we can read the information stored in these cookies. We can recognize your device in this manner using the ID and retrieve the information stored in the device profile about you viewing our ads, as well as storing further data there. This allows us to record information about the use of our website, in particular any conversions that occur. We can thereby see which keywords, ads, groups of ads, and ad campaigns resulted in the desired actions from users. In addition, we can understand what our return on investment (ROI) is and make informed decisions about our advertising costs. We can also automatically optimize our advertising campaigns in line with our business goals.
We process
conversion HTTP data, conversion device data, and conversion profile data.
The legal basis for processing is your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You may withdraw your consent at any time via our .
We transfer your data to the following categories of recipients as part of this processing: Conversion tracking providers.
We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section C.
Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.
Remarketing technology
We use remarketing technology on our website if you have given your consent. Remarketing (also called retargeting) means that we can retarget users who have already interacted with our website (with ads in search engines or on other websites that share the same advertising network as us, for example).
When you access our website we collect information about your use of our website and this is stored in a device profile. A unique ID is allocated to your device which is linked to the device profile in order to assign this information to your device. This ID is stored in cookies (see our ) on your device. If you subsequently use search engines or visit other websites that share the same advertising network as us on the same device, your device may be recognized on the basis of the ID that was allocated to it. The stored information about the use of our website can be accessed using this ID, including allocating your device profile to certain advertising segments. The provider of the remarketing tool used by us can target our ads shown to you in this manner. This processing takes place, if applicable, dependent on your consent given to the respective operator of the website.
When you visit search engines or other websites that share the same advertising network as us, the provider of the remarketing tool used by us can store information about the use of the search engine or other information about the ads that you have been shown or interacted with in the device profile in order to enable better personalization. In addition, the enrichment of the profile carried out by the provider of the remarketing tool used by us enables the placement of various adverts to be optimized for us and other companies for whom they place ads (monitoring the frequency of the incorporation of certain ads, for example).
Your ads are personalized and specifically aimed at you by us and the provider of the remarketing tool used by us using your device profile, in particular your usage of our website. We analyze the information stored in your profile and assign your profile to certain advertising segments on this basis.
We process
remarketing HTTP data, remarketing device data, and remarketing profile data.
The legal basis for processing is your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You may withdraw your consent at any time via our .
We transfer your data to the following categories of recipient as part of this processing: Remarketing providers.
We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section C.
Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.
Surveys about our services
You have the option to answer surveys about our services on our website (in particular about customer satisfaction). These surveys allow us to improve and optimize our products and services. We may also invite you to take part in such surveys by email (in the newsletter, for example).
We process
survey data, HTTP data, registration data, and log-in data.
The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest in improving our services (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). If you no longer wish to receive support feedback requests you can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in every newsletter. We also analyze the queries dealt with by our Customer Support team to improve our customer support.
We transfer your data to the following categories of recipients as part of this processing: Opinion survey providers.
We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section C.
Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.
VI. Applicant Data
We process data supplied by applicants as part of the application process. This includes the following information: Name, address, telephone and cell numbers, email addresses, and the personal data contained within the application documents. We only process applications if they have been entered into our recruiting system. This is the case where the applicant has applied to us via our Careers website. If the applicant applies to us via another path that we had not specified (such as by email), we will transfer the data into the system. The applicant then receives automatic confirmations of receipt, invitations, and rejections via the system. We process the data purely for the purposes of handling the application. Applicant data is (re)processed in accordance with Art. 88 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in conjunction with section 26 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and, in the event of a rejection, is automatically erased after 6 months. In the event that the applicant has consented to the further storage of their personal data, we will transfer the data to our pool of applicants. The applicant may contact their contact within the HR department to erase their applicant account and the data held within it earlier than this. The data there is automatically erased after a period of two years. For more information, please go to our
Jimdo Careers page
.
C. Data transmission to third countries
Jimdo ensures that your data is processed in the EU or in the European Economic Area. Should this no longer be possible and data needs to be transferred to a third country, Jimdo will ensure, after prior review, that an adequate level of data protection that meets the requirements of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the EU Commission is adhered to in the country the data is transferred to.
In these cases, the data is transferred on the basis of an Adequacy Decision of the European Commission or the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transmission of personal data to third countries in its currently valid version. These can be accessed here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004D0915.
Data transmission to a third country may also take place on the basis of your consent. You will be provided with details of this separately, if applicable.
D. Storage duration of your personal data
We store your personal data for various reasons (such as technical reasons and legal reasons) for different durations. Generally, we only store your data for as long as necessary for the respective purpose or where we are contractually or legally obligated to store the data for a longer period.
We store HTTP data and server log files for a maximum of three (3) months unless there is a security incident (such as a DDoS attack). In the event of a security incident, server log files will be stored until the incident has been rectified and fully investigated.
Co-browsing session data is generally erased no later than 30 days afterwards.
We store and use the data provided to us by Jimdo users to process contracts. After the contract has been implemented in full or the customer account has been erased, the data will be blocked taking fiscal and legal retention periods into consideration and then erased after the expiry of such periods, provided the Jimdo user has not expressly consented to the further use of their data or where we are permitted by law to further use the data, which the user will be informed about separately.
E. Use of cookies and comparable technology

In addition, the storage of cookies on your end user device is technically strictly necessary for the use of the Chatbot (§ 25 (2) no. 2 TTDSG). As part of the processing, we transfer your data to the following categories of recipients: customer support service providers, Chatbot providers. Insofar as a support ticket is created in this context, we transfer your personal data to a data processor in the USA for this purpose. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section 3. Further information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section 4.
2.5 Marketing and personalized newsletter
We send our customers regular information on Jimdo’s products, services, promotions, surveys, prize draws, blog articles, and other similar content in the form of a newsletter sent by email. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time using the unsubscribe link contained in every newsletter. We process certain data in connection with this when we send and analyze the success of our newsletter.
We may reconstruct individual functionalities (such as using behavioral data) of our newsletter to understand which content in our newsletter is particularly interesting to Jimdo Users. We will only use the results of these analyses for the purposes of improving our services and designing our services to better meet your requirements as well as for targeting purposes. The newsletter therefore contains a “web beacon”, which is a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server, or, if applicable, the server of an analysis service provider when the newsletter is opened. Technical information, such as browser and system information, as well as IP address and the time of the retrieval is collected as part of this process. This information is used to improve the technical performance of our services using the technical data, or the target groups and reading behavior based on the access location (which can be determined using the IP address), or the time of access. Statistical data that is also collected includes determining whether the newsletter has been opened, when it was opened, how long it was opened for, and which links were clicked on. From a technical perspective, it may be possible to assign this information to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is not our goal to analyze individual users. Rather, these analyses help us to adapt and aggregate our content as needed.
You may object to or withdraw your consent to the storage and usage of your data for sending the newsletter at any time with future effect without needing to give reasons, without being penalized in any way, and without paying any cost for this other than the transmission costs for sending the objection/withdrawal. This can be done by clicking the unsubscribe link in the newsletter, which can be found at the end of every newsletter. Alternatively, you can deselect the “Newsletter” box in your customer account.
Your consent to statistical analysis will also be withdrawn at the same time. It is not possible to only object to the statistical analysis in our newsletter, this can only take place when completely unsubscribing from the newsletter. The lawfulness of the data processing operations remains unaffected by the withdrawal of your consent. In the event that you withdraw your consent, the personal data used for this data processing will be anonymized or erased. Data that we store for other purposes (such as email addresses for the member area) is not affected by this.
To do this we process
contact data, newsletter form HTTP data, newsletter subscription data, newsletter tracking pixel data, and newsletter profile data.
The legal basis for sending the newsletter in connection with a purchase of Jimdo’s goods or services is section 7 (3) German Competition Act (UWG). It is also possible to send the Jimdo newsletter on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). We transfer your data to the following categories of recipients as part of this processing: Newsletter dispatch service providers, newsletter analysis service providers. We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section 3. Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section 4.
2.6 Orders for payment
In the event of a late payment, if the other legal requirements are met, Jimdo will transfer the necessary data to the company commissioned to enforce the claim.
To do this we process:
Order data, contact data, payment data, transaction email data, and registration data.
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) and Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is asserting a contractual claim. Negative payment experiences from the time the main claim was handed over, together with dunning charges or any bad debts, are also shared with cooperating credit agencies (debt collection registration) if the other legal requirements are met. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from our interest and that of third parties in reducing contractual risks for existing and future contracts. We transfer your data to the following categories of recipient as part of this processing: Debt collection partners, and, if necessary, credit agencies and/or district or regional courts. Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section 4.
2.7 Legal obligations and protecting vital interests
In addition to the purposes of processing stated above, Jimdo may also be obligated to process personal data for legal reasons (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR).
This applies especially in the following cases:
When participating in investigations and proceedings carried out by state bodies (authorities and/or courts), in particular to clarify, investigate, and prosecute illegal acts.
Fulfillment of statutory right to information requests that third parties have made to us (such as in the event of an infringement of intellectual property rights or other illegal activities).
Retention and storage of personal data to fulfill statutory retention obligations (further information about the storage of your data by Jimdo can be found in Section 4).
In addition, Jimdo may process personal data in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another individual (Art. 6 (1) (d) GDPR). This applies especially in the following cases:

As part of the processing outlined above, your data may be transmitted to the following categories of recipients: Prosecutorial authorities, courts, other governmental bodies, third parties (who assert statutory right to information requests against us or who are involved in legal proceedings if they provide us with a legal order, court order, or equivalent legal order), external service providers/(sub)contractors, payment service providers, etc. In the event that personal data is transferred to third countries, this will only be done in strict compliance with the relevant legal provisions. Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section 4.
3. Data transmission to third countries
Jimdo ensures that your data is processed in the EU or in the European Economic Area. Should this no longer be possible and data needs to be transferred to a third country, Jimdo will ensure, after prior review, that an adequate level of data protection that meets the requirements of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the EU Commission is adhered to in the country the data is transferred to. In these cases, the data is transferred on the basis of an Adequacy Decision of the European Commission or the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transmission of personal data to third countries in its current valid version. These can be accessed

Data transmission to a third country may also take place on the basis of your consent. You will be provided with details of this separately, if applicable.

We store HTTP data and server log files for a maximum of three (3) months unless there is a security incident (such as a DDoS attack). In the event of a security incident, server log files will be stored until the incident has been rectified and fully investigated.
Co-browsing session data is generally erased no later than 30 days afterwards.
Otherwise, we only store your data for as long as necessary for the respective purpose or where we are contractually or legally obligated to store the data for a longer period.

We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services

services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions.

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device

requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the

Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring
:

configure Analytics data collection
.
Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase Realtime Database
Cloud Storage for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Firebase Test Lab
Firebase App Check
Firebase App Distribution
Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data
Firebase Service Data is personal information that Google collects and generates
during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.
Examples of Firebase Service Data include information about service usage,
resource identifiers like application IDs and package name/bundle IDs, technical
and operational details of usage such as IP addresses, and direct communications
with developers from feedback and support related conversations.
*Services covered include Firebase A/B Testing, Firebase App Distribution,
  Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Dynamic Links,
  Firebase Hosting, Firebase In-App Messaging, Firebase ML,
  Firebase Performance Monitoring, Firebase Realtime Database,
  Firebase Remote Config, and Firebase User Segmentation Storage.
