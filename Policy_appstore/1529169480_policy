This Privacy Policy applies to information Wing Aviation LLC and its subsidiaries (“Wing” “we” or “us”) collect about you when you use our websites, mobile applications and other products and services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Services") and when you contact or otherwise interact with us. Our Services include, for example, services we provide in connection with the operation of drones, including air space-related information and drone traffic planning services (collectively, “OpenSky Services”) as well as delivery services provided by Wing’s drones, which may be fulfilled through orders submitted through our Services or other parties. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to the data practices of companies or individuals other than Wing, including companies you may transact with through our Services.
01
Information we collect
We collect information in the following ways:
Information You Provide to Us:
We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, provide feedback, participate in a contest or promotion, communicate with us via third party sites, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, delivery information and any other information you choose to provide. For OpenSky Services, this may include information you provide about your pilot or organizational license information (such as issue and expiration date and license number), the drone you are operating, your proposed flight destination and plan.
Information We Collect Automatically Through the Services
:  When you access, use or otherwise interact with our Services, we automatically collect certain information, including:
Device Information
: We collect device-specific information, such as a unique application number (if applicable to the Services you are using), your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number.
Transactional Information
: When you request a delivery, we collect information about the transaction, such as the items ordered, merchant details, package details (e.g., type), purchase price, date, delivery destination and other similar order details.
Log Information
: We automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes: details of how you use our Services (including search terms you enter and the results), IP address, and device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
Device Location Information
: Depending on your mobile device and browser settings, we may collect information about the location of the device you use to access our Services, including precise location through our mobile app (in accordance with permission requirements of your mobile device), and your approximate location based on IP address. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide us with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
Information about Your Drone and Flights
: If you choose to connect your drone to a device while you are using our OpenSky Services, we may collect information about your drone, such as your drone’s serial number and model information. We may also collect information about the flight destination you selected, the flight plan generated, your drone’s location, and information about your past flights (i.e., logbook information).
Cookies and Similar Technologies
: We and our service providers use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. For example, Wing uses Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with our site and apps. If you don’t want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics Opt-out browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy

Images
: Wing drones use low-resolution cameras in our navigation systems, to confirm terrain data and for safety purposes. The cameras on Wing’s drone may incidentally capture low-resolution black-and-white overhead images when fulfilling deliveries, which may include images of individuals or other objects within the field of view of our drones. For delivery services ordered directly through Wing, in limited instances we may associate these images with the Wing account of the user that requested the delivery, such as to confirm the delivery location.
Information We Collect From Other Sources
: We may also obtain information from other sources, third parties, or publicly available data, including as follows:
We may collect information about you from our third-party social media channels if you choose to engage with these channels. If you log into our Services through your Google account, we will have access to limited profile data (such as email address, phone number, name and profile picture associated with your Google account).
In connection with our delivery Services, we may collect information, such as delivery address, from our partners.
In connection with certain OpenSky Services, we may collect information about you from:
Participating third-party RID services providers. The information we collect from them is similar to the information described above about your drone and flights. If you are located in the US, drone and flight information may be collected from approved UAS Service Suppliers (USS) and Wing will retain such data until you choose to delete it.
Other providers of aviation-related services and their users, such as airspace information about your proposed flight with such provider, in order to detect conflicts.

Information or documents you provide or any assessment you may take as part of the application process.

How we use the information we collect.
We will use your information for the purposes of carrying out the application and recruitment process, including by:
Assessing your skills, qualifications, and interests against our career opportunities;
Verifying your information, carrying out reference checks, conducting background checks (where applicable), and completing drug and alcohol testing for safety-sensitive roles as required by a regulatory authority if you are offered a job;
Communicating with you about the recruitment process and/or your application(s), including, in appropriate cases, informing you of other potential career opportunities at Wing;

03
Our legal basis for processing the personal data of EEA, Swiss, or British persons.
If you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the UK, certain data protection laws apply to the processing of your personal data. We collect and process your information where it is necessary in order to take steps, at your request, prior to our potentially entering into an employment relationship with you.
We may also seek your consent to process your personal information in specific circumstances, or process it where necessary to comply with a legal obligation or for purposes connected to legal claims.

04
How we permit access to your personal data.
Wing may share your information with our service providers, affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures. Wing or Wing’s service providers, affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures may store your personal information on servers in many countries around the world, including the United States. We may therefore store and process your personal information on servers outside the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries; however, we work hard to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold.
If you have been referred for a job at Wing by a current Wing employee, with your consent, we may inform that employee about the progress of your application and let the Wing employee know the outcome of the process. In some cases, if it is identified that you have attended the same university/school or shared the same previous employer during the same period as a current Wing employee, we may consult with that employee for feedback on you.
Wing may also use service providers acting on Wing’s behalf to perform some of the services described above, including, without limitation, to perform background checks, to accommodate your application process, for example, by arranging travel around an interview, or to help you relocate to our offices if this forms part of your offer of employment. These service providers may be located outside the country in which you live or the country where the position you have applied for is located.
Wing may sometimes be required to disclose your information to external third parties such as local labor authorities, courts and tribunals, regulatory bodies, and/or law enforcement agencies for the purpose of complying with applicable laws and regulations, or in response to legal process.
We will also share your personal information with other third parties if we have your consent (for example if you have given us permission to contact your referees), or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Wing, our users, applicants, candidates, employees, or the public, or as otherwise required by law.
It is your responsibility to obtain consent from referees before providing their personal information to Wing.
05
How we retain information.
Wing takes appropriate steps to protect information about you that is collected, processed, and stored as part of the application and recruitment process.
If you apply for a job at Wing and your application is unsuccessful (or you withdraw from the process or decline our offer), Wing will retain your information for a period after your application. We retain this information for various reasons, including in case we face a legal challenge related to a recruitment decision, to consider you for other current or future jobs at Wing, and to help us better understand, analyze and improve our recruitment processes. If you do not want us to retain your information for consideration for other roles, or want us to update it, please contact
wing-privacy@wing.com
. Please note, however, that we may retain some information as required by law, or as necessary to protect ourselves from legal claims.
06
Your data rights.
In certain countries, you may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. If you wish to access, correct, update, restrict processing, request transfer, or request deletion of personal information we may hold about you, you can do so at any time by contacting us at
wing-privacy@wing.com
. We will respond to any requests in accordance with applicable law, and so there may be circumstances where we are not able to comply with your request.
If you can’t find the answer to your question in this policy, or have a concern about how we process your personal information, you can contact Wing’s Chief Privacy Officer at
wing-privacy@wing.com
. Depending on your country of residence, if we are unable to resolve your question, you may also raise any questions or concerns you have regarding your personal information with your local data protection authority.
07
