We also may receive information from third parties to supplement the information we receive from you. We use information from these companies primarily to help us deliver relevant advertising to you. A representative list of these types of third parties can be found below.

2. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
Back to Top
We collect some information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form or when you communicate with our customer support team. We and third parties also use certain technologies, described below, to deliver positive customer experiences.
Our products change over time and those changes are reflected in new versions that are available to download from the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, and other official stores. Bad Wolf recommends that you always use the latest version of our products to guarantee you have the most secure, privacy-oriented, and engaging experience possible.
Bad Wolf products may not provide all of the privacy protections discussed in this document. Your continued use of them indicates that you understand that your data may be collected by Bad Wolf and third party partners and that you consent to that collection.
Bad Wolf cannot guarantee the integrity of versions of products that are installed from unofficial channels and does not provide customer support or provide privacy guarantees for those unofficial versions. If you are using a version of one of our products that was installed from an unofficial channel, we encourage you to remove it from you device as soon as possible and install an officially distributed version.
A. COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
Back to Top
We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features, or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don’t see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise enhance your user experience. We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie, such as web beacons, pixels and other similar technologies. Your Internet web browser enables you to opt out of tracking with cookies. Please visit
http://www.allaboutcookies.org
or the documentation for your individual web browser if you would like to learn more about managing your cookie preferences.
We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our products, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud, and to enforce our Privacy Policy. Our legal basis for this collection and processing is to protect our legitimate business interests and therefore do not seek consent to collect your information for these purposes. You may contact
bad.wolf.games36@gmail.com
if you have additional questions about these use cases.
B. ANALYTICS TECHNOLOGIES
Back to Top
We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our products, your computer or device and the health of our products.
For example, Bad Wolf may collect and store data from your device when you use our products. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics and system interactions. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and may be transmitted to Bad Wolf when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online components of our games, such as leaderboards, Bad Wolf may also collect, use, store, transmit, and publicly display statistical data regarding game scores and achievements.
Third party analytics services integrated into our products may combine the information they collect in connection with Bad Wolf’s services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites and applications. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of the third party analytics companies that operate in our products can be found in the Appendix below.
C. AD SERVING TECHNOLOGIES
Back to Top
Our products may employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different mobile apps, devices, and websites. The ads can be tailored to your interests. This is called interest-based advertising. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a product we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might receive an advertisement later for that game or similar products in Bad Wolf games or in different mobile applications or on websites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded to your mobile device or web browser and later replaced while you are online.
These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to device advertising identifiers, this information includes:
Advertisements served and the location of the ad;
Length of time an advertisement was visible;
Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and
Advertisement response.
Third party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our products with other information they have independently collected over time and across different products, websites, and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks in our games as well as how to opt out the extent applicable can be found below.
To learn more about some of these ad networks’ practices, see the Your Choices and Controls section below.
European Economic Area only. Prior to being shown ads in Bad Wolf products, you will be asked whether you consent to the tracking that enables personalized ads. You have the right to change your consent status at any point in time.

Back to Top
When you use an Bad Wolf product, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, for fraud prevention, security, and authentication purposes.

4. HOW WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION
Back to Top
Bad Wolf uses analytics services to understand how users engage with our products. Our analysis relies on your consistent device identifier, or identifier for vendor (IDFV) on Apple devices, so that we can track your behavior over time and develop an understanding of how you prefer to interact with our products. If you have more than one Bad Wolf product installed on your device, those products may share the same identifier value. This enables us to develop an understanding of how you engage with all of the Bad Wolf products you have installed. The identifier value is provided to Bad Wolf through the operating system on your device. In the course of processing your data, we may do any of the following:
Analyze your behavior in our products over time;
Analyze your behavior in aggregate;
Combine your information with the information of other players to create anonymized aggregate reports that allow us to understand large-scale behavior trends;
Analyze your information to understand how well our products perform on your device or to investigate bugs, crashes, and other technical issues;
Combine your information with the information of other players to create customer segments based on behavior in our products or location-based behavior;
Use analysis of your behavior in our products to provide you with customized gameplay experiences;
Use your device identifier to enroll you in an A/B test. An A/B test is a type of simple behavioral experiment wherein groups of users are provided with slightly different experiences in our products so that we can research and analyze which of the experiences is the most compelling to users of our products; and
Analyze your behavior in the context of an A/B test.
European Economic Area (EEA) Only:
Per requirements under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we log your consent state for compliance purposes. This information is stored on servers hosted in the EU and is used solely for GDPR compliance. Your device identifier is stored along with your consent status. If you consent to personalized advertising, your device advertising identifier also is stored in case we need to be able to access it to assist you with data portability or erasure requests. Your device advertising identifier is not stored in our consent logging database if you do not consent to personalized advertising.
Please note that your advertising consent status is only respected when you are playing the game from within an EEA member country.
5. INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES
Back to Top
We do not share personal information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email, or postal address) with independent third parties without your consent, unless it is required by law or we determine that disclosure is critical to protect our rights, property, or operations or to protect our players or third parties. We may share anonymous or aggregated information, or other data that does not directly identify you, with third parties, for instance your persona on leaderboards or to show trends about use of our products.
We employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)) to collect or process personal information on our behalf for various reasons, such as conducting market surveys or analyzing gameplay event data. When our third party agents or service providers collect or receive personal information, we require that they use the data only on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy.
We do not knowingly disclose personal information about children under 16 years of age to independent third parties even with consent.
However, in the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law.
We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity. When third party technologies or social tools are integrated into our products, those third parties may collect information when you use our products. An example is the Facebook “Like” button.
European Economic Area (EEA) Only:
We use your device settings and SIM card registered country to determine whether we believe you are located in the EEA. That processing is done on your device.
If your device indicates that you are located in the EEA:
Bad Wolf does not collect gameplay analytics from your device;
We prompt you for your age to determine whether you are old enough to lawfully consent to tracking of your device identifier and advertising identifier; and
If you are of legal age to consent in your country of residence, we prompt you for consent to serve personalized advertising.
6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
Back to Top
Personal information we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy in the United States or any other country in which Bad Wolf, its business partners, or third party agents operate. By using our products, you consent that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.
7. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Back to Top
We have put in place reasonable controls designed to help safeguard the personal information we collect via our products. However, no security measures are perfect and we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be accessed or used in an unauthorized way.
8. AGE GUIDELINES AND CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Back to Top
Protecting children’s privacy is extremely important to us. We also encourage parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children’s online experiences at all times.
Bad Wolf’s products are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16. If you are under 16 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian’s permission to use or access Bad Wolf’s products. If you believe Bad Wolf has inadvertently collected such information, please contact us (information below) so we can promptly remove the information.
9. DATA RETENTION
Back to Top
Bad Wolf has a policy of retaining information we collect for no longer than 90 days. During the period when we hold Information, we may transform and aggregate it such that it no longer is personally identifiable. We may retain the de-identified aggregate data products for more than 90 days to support business critical needs.
Uninstalling Bad Wolf applications from your devices does not cause the data that we possess to be deleted. It remains subject to the same data retention and expiration policies.
10. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING (EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA ONLY)
Back to Top
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where: (i) we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver a service you have requested), or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests which are not already described in this Privacy Policy, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
A. TECHNICAL AND USAGE INFORMATION
Back to Top
Bad Wolf does not collect in-game technical or usage data or gameplay analytics for players in the European Economic Area. Note that Google Play Services, Apple Game Center, and other platform-level services may collect gameplay analytics if you are located within the EEA.

Bad Wolf considers any data specific to your use of our apps that is collected or processed through Google Play Services or Apple Game Center to be in our legitimate business interests.
B. ADVERTISING NETWORKS
Back to Top
Bad Wolf works with advertising partners that may collect information from you as part of their process of serving advertisements in our products. This is described above in the section “Ad Serving Technologies.” In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Bad Wolf’s advertising partners in the European Economic Area all function as independent data controllers. Prior to showing you personalized advertisements, you will be asked whether you consent to sharing your information with the advertising company. If you are a resident of an EEA country and indicate that you are below the age of 16, you will be served non-personalized ads and the advertising companies will not collect personal information from you.

A. COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
Back to Top
We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features, or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don’t see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise enhance your user experience. We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie, such as web beacons, pixels and other similar technologies. Your Internet web browser enables you to opt out of tracking with cookies. Please visit
http://www.allaboutcookies.org
or the documentation for your individual web browser if you would like to learn more about managing your cookie preferences.
We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our products, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud, and to enforce our Privacy Policy. Our legal basis for this collection and processing is to protect our legitimate business interests and therefore do not seek consent to collect your information for these purposes. You may contact
bad.wolf.games36@gmail.com
if you have additional questions about these use cases.
B. ANALYTICS TECHNOLOGIES
Back to Top
We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our products, your computer or device and the health of our products.
For example, Bad Wolf may collect and store data from your device when you use our products. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics and system interactions. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and may be transmitted to Bad Wolf when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online components of our games, such as leaderboards, Bad Wolf may also collect, use, store, transmit, and publicly display statistical data regarding game scores and achievements.
Third party analytics services integrated into our products may combine the information they collect in connection with Bad Wolf’s services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites and applications. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of the third party analytics companies that operate in our products can be found in the Appendix below.
C. AD SERVING TECHNOLOGIES
Back to Top
Our products may employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different mobile apps, devices, and websites. The ads can be tailored to your interests. This is called interest-based advertising. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a product we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might receive an advertisement later for that game or similar products in Bad Wolf games or in different mobile applications or on websites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded to your mobile device or web browser and later replaced while you are online.
These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to device advertising identifiers, this information includes:
Advertisements served and the location of the ad;
Length of time an advertisement was visible;
Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and
Advertisement response.
Third party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our products with other information they have independently collected over time and across different products, websites, and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks in our games as well as how to opt out the extent applicable can be found below.
To learn more about some of these ad networks’ practices, see the Your Choices and Controls section below.
European Economic Area only. Prior to being shown ads in Bad Wolf products, you will be asked whether you consent to the tracking that enables personalized ads.

4. HOW WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION
Back to Top
Bad Wolf uses analytics services to understand how users engage with our products. Our analysis relies on your consistent device identifier, or identifier for vendor (IDFV) on Apple devices, so that we can track your behavior over time and develop an understanding of how you prefer to interact with our products. If you have more than one Bad Wolf product installed on your device, those products may share the same identifier value. This enables us to develop an understanding of how you engage with all of the Bad Wolf products you have installed. The identifier value is provided to Bad Wolf through the operating system on your device. In the course of processing your data, we may do any of the following:
Analyze your behavior in our products over time;
Analyze your behavior in aggregate;
Combine your information with the information of other players to create anonymized aggregate reports that allow us to understand large-scale behavior trends;
Analyze your information to understand how well our products perform on your device or to investigate bugs, crashes, and other technical issues;
Combine your information with the information of other players to create customer segments based on behavior in our products or location-based behavior;
Use analysis of your behavior in our products to provide you with customized gameplay experiences;
Use your device identifier to enroll you in an A/B test. An A/B test is a type of simple behavioral experiment wherein groups of users are provided with slightly different experiences in our products so that we can research and analyze which of the experiences is the most compelling to users of our products; and
Analyze your behavior in the context of an A/B test.
European Economic Area (EEA) Only:
Per requirements under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we log your consent state for compliance purposes. This information is stored on servers hosted in the EU and is used solely for GDPR compliance. Your device identifier is stored along with your consent status. If you consent to personalized advertising, your device advertising identifier also is stored in case we need to be able to access it to assist you with data portability or erasure requests. Your device advertising identifier is not stored in our consent logging database if you do not consent to personalized advertising.
Please note that your advertising consent status is only respected when you are playing the game from within an EEA member country.
5. INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES
Back to Top
We do not share personal information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email, or postal address) with independent third parties without your consent, unless it is required by law or we determine that disclosure is critical to protect our rights, property, or operations or to protect our players or third parties. We may share anonymous or aggregated information, or other data that does not directly identify you, with third parties, for instance your persona on leaderboards or to show trends about use of our products.
We employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)) to collect or process personal information on our behalf for various reasons, such as conducting market surveys or analyzing gameplay event data. When our third party agents or service providers collect or receive personal information, we require that they use the data only on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy.
We do not knowingly disclose personal information about children under 16 years of age to independent third parties even with consent.
However, in the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law.
We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity. When third party technologies or social tools are integrated into our products, those third parties may collect information when you use our products. An example is the Facebook “Like” button.
European Economic Area (EEA) Only:
We use your device settings and SIM card registered country to determine whether we believe you are located in the EEA. That processing is done on your device.
If your device indicates that you are located in the EEA:
Bad Wolf does not collect gameplay analytics from your device;
We prompt you for your age to determine whether you are old enough to lawfully consent to tracking of your device identifier and advertising identifier; and

10. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING (EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA ONLY)
Back to Top
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where: (i) we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver a service you have requested), or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests which are not already described in this Privacy Policy, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

4. HOW WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION
Back to Top
Bad Wolf uses analytics services to understand how users engage with our products. Our analysis relies on your consistent device identifier, or identifier for vendor (IDFV) on Apple devices, so that we can track your behavior over time and develop an understanding of how you prefer to interact with our products. If you have more than one Bad Wolf product installed on your device, those products may share the same identifier value. This enables us to develop an understanding of how you engage with all of the Bad Wolf products you have installed. The identifier value is provided to Bad Wolf through the operating system on your device. In the course of processing your data, we may do any of the following:
Analyze your behavior in our products over time;
Analyze your behavior in aggregate;
Combine your information with the information of other players to create anonymized aggregate reports that allow us to understand large-scale behavior trends;
Analyze your information to understand how well our products perform on your device or to investigate bugs, crashes, and other technical issues;
Combine your information with the information of other players to create customer segments based on behavior in our products or location-based behavior;
Use analysis of your behavior in our products to provide you with customized gameplay experiences;
Use your device identifier to enroll you in an A/B test. An A/B test is a type of simple behavioral experiment wherein groups of users are provided with slightly different experiences in our products so that we can research and analyze which of the experiences is the most compelling to users of our products; and
Analyze your behavior in the context of an A/B test.
European Economic Area (EEA) Only:
Per requirements under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we log your consent state for compliance purposes. This information is stored on servers hosted in the EU and is used solely for GDPR compliance. Your device identifier is stored along with your consent status. If you consent to personalized advertising, your device advertising identifier also is stored in case we need to be able to access it to assist you with data portability or erasure requests. Your device advertising identifier is not stored in our consent logging database if you do not consent to personalized advertising.
Please note that your advertising consent status is only respected when you are playing the game from within an EEA member country.
5. INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES
Back to Top
We do not share personal information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email, or postal address) with independent third parties without your consent, unless it is required by law or we determine that disclosure is critical to protect our rights, property, or operations or to protect our players or third parties. We may share anonymous or aggregated information, or other data that does not directly identify you, with third parties, for instance your persona on leaderboards or to show trends about use of our products.
We employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)) to collect or process personal information on our behalf for various reasons, such as conducting market surveys or analyzing gameplay event data. When our third party agents or service providers collect or receive personal information, we require that they use the data only on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy.
We do not knowingly disclose personal information about children under 16 years of age to independent third parties even with consent.
However, in the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law.
We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity. When third party technologies or social tools are integrated into our products, those third parties may collect information when you use our products. An example is the Facebook “Like” button.
European Economic Area (EEA) Only:
We use your device settings and SIM card registered country to determine whether we believe you are located in the EEA. That processing is done on your device.
If your device indicates that you are located in the EEA:
Bad Wolf does not collect gameplay analytics from your device;
We prompt you for your age to determine whether you are old enough to lawfully consent to tracking of your device identifier and advertising identifier; and
If you are of legal age to consent in your country of residence, we prompt you for consent to serve personalized advertising.
6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
Back to Top
Personal information we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy in the United States or any other country in which Bad Wolf, its business partners, or third party agents operate. By using our products, you consent that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.
7. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Back to Top
Protecting children’s privacy is extremely important to us. We also encourage parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children’s online experiences at all times.
Bad Wolf’s products are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16. If you are under 16 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian’s permission to use or access Bad Wolf’s products. If you believe Bad Wolf has inadvertently collected such information, please contact us (information below) so we can promptly remove the information.
9. DATA RETENTION

During the period when we hold Information, we may transform and aggregate it such that it no longer is personally identifiable. We may retain the de-identified aggregate data products for more than 90 days to support business critical needs.

10. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING (EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA ONLY)
Back to Top
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where: (i) we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver a service you have requested), or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests which are not already described in this Privacy Policy, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you are a user of a Tenjin customer’s mobile app, and you wish to exercise your right of access, you must contact the owner or operator of the mobile app (the data collector).
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
The California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) became law on January 1st, 2020 but enforcement begins six (6) months from the date the California Attorney General issues final regulations (which shall be no later than July 1st, 2020). With regard to Tenjin’s Services, under CCPA, Tenjin is a service provider. As a service provider, Tenjin processes, and may store, information sent by Tenjin customers from their mobile apps. Tenjin’s customers may send information about the End Users of their apps, and the users’ devices, to Tenjin for processing and storage. Tenjin customers must comply with the opt-out requirements under CCPA (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.120(a)) and take into account any exceptions or other requirements mandated by law. As a service provider, Tenjin relies on CCPA’s business purpose exemption under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.140(t)(2)(C) and as a service provider, Tenjin does not have any direct obligations to the End Users to obtain consent, provide opt-outs, or delete data. If you are a user of a Tenjin customer’s mobile app and you wish to opt-out or exercise another right under CCPA, you must contact the app publisher (the business).
The above applies to both Section 1 and Section 2 below.
