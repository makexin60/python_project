Align™ technology, inc. And its affiliates (“align”, "we", "us" and "ours") are committed to protecting your information (in this privacy statement, “information” refers to the personally identifiable information, considered personal data, that you provide or we collect on, about, or from you through our websites).
Align designs, manufacturers and markets the Invisalign

We collect the following kinds of personal information and sensitive information about customers, patients (former, potential and current), patients' parents/guardians, physicians, and website visitors when you register to become a member of our sites or via on-line forms or when you download and use the app, for example, when you sign up to receive news alerts from us or to undergo a Smile Assessment, schedule an appointment or virtual consultation with a provider through our Concierge team, or to use the mobile or in-practice SmileView tool:
Contact details such as your name, address, phone number, and email address.
Information to help us treat you such as age, gender, and health information regarding your teeth, including images of your teeth and face.
We will notify you of such purposes at the time that we request to collect personal data or sensitive information from you and will only collect the information that is strictly necessary to fulfil those purposes.
Where we collect health information or other kinds of sensitive data via our Sites, we will ask for your explicit consent, where required by law.
We will also collect information about your use of our sites as described in the section
Manage Cookies
below.
On occasions you may choose to provide us with personal data about other people so that, for example, we can contact them with information about us. You must only share their personal data with us if you have obtained their consent and permission to do so.

What do we do with the information we collect?
The personal information we gather from your use of our sites or provided by you may be used:
To set up and otherwise manage your member account in our sites.
To allow you to use, purchase, book and/or download products and services such as for example the purchase of cleaning supplies.
To provide you with information about our products, services, news and events.
To provide details of physicians and their practices and submit contact requests to them.
To invite you to take part in our surveys or become a member of a fan club (where applicable).
To gather demographic information about user trends, such as age, gender, and general income levels.
To provide certified physicians with information on actual or prospective patients.
To analyze use of our services and products, develop new services and products, and customize our products, services and other information we make available.
To use content uploaded to the app to share via social media and make copies of your content to advertise Invisalign on the internet, on tv, in publications or in any other medium. We will never display your name in any promotional material we create, but you should be aware that other people may still recognise you from your photograph.
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Where we have entered into a contract with you, such as to provide you with our Invisalign goods and services, we will process your information to perform that contract. In other circumstances we may process your information for the legitimate business interests of align such as marketing or improving our products and services, provided that these interests are not overridden by your rights. We will make it clear to you at the time of collection what our legitimate interests are.
We do use a robust combination of data sources (online, orders, customers, etc.) To get a full picture of our product and marketing efforts. This data is only for our efforts and we do not share your information with other businesses for them to use for purposes other than their work with us.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

Who do we share your personal information with?
We partner with other businesses to assist us in our marketing, communications, storage, and sales efforts, and may share information about you for these purposes. These partners are not allowed to use your information for any purpose other than doing business with align™. Check our list of our
current service providers
.
We may also share your information with other align™ companies to carry out the purposes described in "what do we do with the information we collect?" Check the list of our
group of companies
.
In addition, any information we collect, including personal information, may be disclosed to a third party (and their agents and advisers) as part of any actual or potential merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.
We may also disclose personal information about you to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party if we believe that doing so is legally required or is necessary to protect our property or other legal rights (including but not limited to enforcement of our agreements or the rights of others).
We may also share your information if you consent to us doing so, including with Invisalign dentists or orthodontists of your choice and/or at your direction.

How long do we keep your information?
We retain personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with Invisalign goods and services or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

International data transfers
Align's European headquarters are in Switzerland and we operate globally. We may therefore transfer your personal information to other countries where Align or its third party service providers and partners operate, including countries other than your country of residence.
Align™ protects your information when we transfer it to other countries. For example, when we transfer your information to some countries (such as Switzerland) from the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), we can do so because relevant government authorities have identified that country as having adequate data protection laws. Transfers from the EEA or the UK to Switzerland will be carried out pursuant to the EU Commission decision 2000/58/EC, as amended from time to time, which recognises Swiss law as providing adequate level of protection. In other cases, we use the standard contractual clauses or Align's Binding Corporate Rules, both of which are recognised by the appropriate government authorities. Our Binding Corporate Rules (accessible
here
) establish Align's approach to the protection and management of personal information globally.

Security
Our Sites have appropriate technical and organisational security measures in place to try to protect against the destruction, loss, misuse and alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access of the information under our control. Our web portals, such as the Invisalign Doctor Site, transmit patient information (including any personal data) securely via HTTPS. These portals require customer accounts and are not available to the general public.

If you have rights concerning access, disclosure, amendment, or deletion (as determined by applicable law), you may contact us at the address or email listed below.
For example, in California, individuals may request once per calendar year a list of disclosures we make to third parties for their direct marketing efforts. It is not our practice to sell or lease any personal information to other companies for their direct marketing.

Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
Complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact
Your local data protection authority

These are just examples and your particular rights may not be listed here as an example.
