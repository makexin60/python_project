Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how and 
									when This-App collects, uses, and shares 
									your information when you use This-App, 
									including our mobile applications and 
									websites (the "Services"). This-App receives 
									your information through our mobile 
									applications, websites, email notifications, 
									and other interactions with our Services. 
									When using any of our Services you consent 
									to the collection, transfer, manipulation, 
									storage, disclosure and other uses of your 
									information as described in this Privacy 
									Policy. Irrespective of which country you 
									live in, you authorize us to use your 
									information in, and as a result to transfer 
									it to and store it in, the United States and 
									any other country where we operate. Privacy 
									and data protection laws in some of these 
									countries may vary from the laws in the 
									country where you live.
Information Collection and Use
Creating a This-App Account and 
									Profile Information:
When 
									you create a This-App account, you must 
									provide access credentials either in the 
									form of an email address and password or by 
									authentication using another service, such 
									as Google or Facebook. You may optionally 
									provide us with additional profile 
									information, including a short bio, 
									location, and profile picture. If you create 
									your This-App account by connecting through 
									another service, we may use public 
									information from that connected account to 
									help complete your This-App profile. You may 
									update or modify your profile information 
									and contact information at any time. Profile 
									information is available publicly on our 
									Services, such as on your profile page.
Contact Information:
In 
									addition to using your contact information 
									to create your account, we may use this 
									information to send you information about 
									our Services, respond to your requests and 
									facilitate your use of the Services. We may 
									use the contact information (such as your 
									phone number or email address) to help 
									connect you with other This-App users, even 
									if that information is not publicly 
									displayed. Some contact information may be 
									required in order to use certain Services. 
									For example, you must have a verified phone 
									number attached to your account in order to 
									send a This-App Message to someone who does 
									not follow you.
Finding Friends and Connecting to 
									Other Services:
Our 
									Services include several features to help 
									connect you to the accounts of people you 
									already know. For example, you may upload 
									information from your address book or 
									connect your This-App account to your 
									account on another service such as Google or 
									Facebook. This-App will match the 
									information you provide with the contact 
									information of other This-App users in order 
									to provide and improve the Services, for 
									example by making recommendations and 
									routing This-App messages. You may remove 
									address book data from This-App at any time 
									through the settings in your This-App app. 
									When you connect your This-App account to 
									other services, you are able to post your 
									Content to those services as well. You may 
									disconnect your This-App account from your 
									account on the other services at any time. 
									Disconnecting your This-App account will 
									immediately revoke our authorization to 
									cross-post on your behalf or otherwise 
									access that account and we will delete 
									information obtained from that connection 
									(other than information that was publicly 
									posted on This-App, such as profile 
									information), which may take some time.
Content, Following, and other 
									Public Information:
This-App 
									has a feature for video sharing and 
									publishing, so most of the information you 
									provide us is information that you choose to 
									be made public. This includes not only the 
									Content that you post and data provided with 
									such Content, such as when it was posted, 
									but also the accounts you follow, the 
									Content that you like or comment on, and 
									other public interactions on the Services. 
									Your public information is broadly and 
									instantly disseminated. For instance, your 
									profile information and public Content are 
									immediately delivered to a wide range of 
									users and other services that access 
									This-App. When you share information or 
									Content via the Services, you should think 
									carefully about what you are making public.
Location Information:
In 
									addition to profile information, you may 
									also tell us your exact location if you 
									choose to enable your computer or mobile 
									device to send us location information. We 
									may use and store information about your 
									location to provide features of our 
									Services, such as tagging a video with a 
									location, and to improve and customize the 
									Services, for example, with Content that has 
									been tagged near your location.
Links:
We 
									may keep track of how you interact with 
									links across our Services, including our 
									email notifications, third-party services, 
									and client applications, by redirecting 
									clicks or through other means. We do this to 
									help improve our Services, for example to 
									provide relevant advertising, and to be able 
									to share aggregate click statistics such as 
									how many times a particular link was clicked 
									on.
Cookies:
Like 
									many websites, we use "cookie" technology to 
									collect additional website usage data and to 
									improve our Services, but we do not require 
									cookies for many parts of our Services such 
									as viewing public videos. A cookie is a 
									small data file that is transferred to your 
									computer's hard disk. This-App may use both 
									session cookies and persistent cookies to 
									better understand how you interact with our 
									Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our 
									users and web traffic routing on our 
									Services, and to customize and improve our 
									Services. Most Internet browsers 
									automatically accept cookies. If you do not 
									want cookies from This-App or other 
									websites, you can instruct your browser, by 
									changing its settings, to stop accepting 
									cookies or to prompt you before accepting a 
									cookie from the websites you visit. However, 
									some Services may not function properly if 
									you disable cookies.
Log Data:
Our 
									servers automatically record information 
									("Log Data") created by your use of the 
									Services. Log Data may include information 
									such as your IP address, browser type, 
									operating system, the referring web page, 
									pages visited, location, your mobile 
									carrier, device and application IDs, search 
									terms, and cookie information. We receive 
									Log Data when you interact with our 
									Services, for example, when you visit our 
									websites, sign into our Services,view videos 
									hosted by This-App, or interact with our 
									email notifications. This-App uses Log Data 
									to provide our Services and to measure, 
									customize, and improve them. If not already 
									done earlier, we will either delete Log Data 
									or remove any common account identifiers, 
									such as your username, full IP address, or 
									email address, after 18 months.
Third-Party Services:
This-App 
									uses a variety of third-party services to 
									help provide our Services, including to host 
									our various blogs and wikis and to help us 
									understand the use of our Services. These 
									third-party service providers may use 
									cookies and other technologies to collect 
									information about your use of our Services 
									and other websites and services, including 
									your IP address, device ID, pages viewed, 
									and links clicked. Our service providers 
									include
Google 
									Analytics

									demographics and interests reporting

									event that This-App is involved in a
