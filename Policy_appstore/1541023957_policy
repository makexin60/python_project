CRAs may link together the records of people that are part of a financial unit. They may do this when people are known to be linked, such as being married or have jointly applied for credit or have joint accounts.

If we disclose your personal data for this purpose, we will ensure that your personal data is kept confidential and only used it in relation to the possible transaction(s).

With any debt purchaser in the event that we sell your debt. If we disclose your personal data for this purpose, we will enter into a contract with the third party debt purchaser requiring them to keep your personal data confidential and process it in accordance with the terms of this notice. Following the sale of your debt, the debt purchaser will become a controller of your personal data and you can request information from them detailing how your personal data will subsequently be used. On the sale of your debt you will be provided with the debt purchaser's contact details as part of our other regulatory obligations; and
Where we have acquired your account from another creditor, with the previous creditor for administrative, regulatory and legal purposes and to help us deal with any complaints or other issues relating to your account.
What personal data do we share with CRAs and why?
In order to process your quote or application (which includes applying for a balance transfer or a money transfer), we will perform credit and identity checks on you with one or more CRAs. Where you take financial services from us, we may also make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your account with us. Where you have been declined for a credit product and have decided to appeal the decision, we will perform another search with certain CRAs. A "soft search" allows us to make a check on your credit file and will leave a footprint so that you can see that we made the check, but the search will not show up to other lenders and will not affect your credit rating. We use soft searches when we carry out eligibility checks, in order to provide quotes and where you have appealed a decline decision. If you make an application for one of our products, we perform a "hard search" with certain CRAs. These searches are visible to other lenders and may affect your credit rating.
To do this, we will supply your personal data to CRAs and they will give us information about you. This will include information from your credit application and about your financial situation and financial history. CRAs will supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit, financial situation and financial history information and fraud prevention information.
We will use this personal data to:
Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product;
Verify the accuracy of the data you have provided to us;
Where you are applying for a balance transfer, to check whether the account from which the balance is transferring is registered to the same address as the address that you have provided to us;
Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering;
Manage your account(s);
Trace and recover debts; and
Ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.
We will continue to exchange personal data about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform some CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, some CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs.
When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.
If you are making a joint application, or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together, so you should make sure you discuss this with them, and share with them this information, before lodging the application. The CRAs we share data with will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.
The identities of the CRAs, their role also as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal data, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail:

What is the legal basis that permits us to use your personal data?
We are only permitted to use your personal data and special categories of personal data if we have a legal basis for doing so as set out under data protection legislation. We rely on the following legal bases to use your personal data:
Where we have your consent (
Consent
);
Where we need information to enter into a contract, or perform the contract we have entered into, with you (
Contractual Performance
);
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (
Legal Obligation
); or
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (
Legitimate Interest
);
In more limited circumstances we may also rely on the following legal bases:
Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests) (
Vital Interest
); or
Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes (
Public Task
).
When we and FPAs process your personal data, we do so on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity, in order to protect our business and to comply with laws that apply to us.
The table at the end of this notice
provides more detail about the personal data that we use, the legal basis that we rely on in each case and your rights.
Some information is classified as special categories of personal data under data protection legislation. We may process special categories of personal information and criminal conviction information in the following circumstances:
In limited circumstances with your explicit consent, in which case we will explain the purpose for which the information will be used at the point where we ask for your consent; and
We will use information about your physical and mental health or disability status to comply with our legal obligations, including to ensure we are complying with our obligations to treat you fairly and to assess your ability to repay your debt.
We will use behavioural biometric data to help us to confirm your identity when you log into your online account manager or your online banking app. This is necessary to prevent or detect crime.
What are the consequences of processing your personal data for fraud prevention or anti-money laundering purposes?
If we, or a FPA, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide a card and/or product to you, or we may stop providing existing products to you.
A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the FPAs, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us by calling our Compliance Team on
0371 522 5146
^.
What happens if you do not provide information that we request?
We need some of your personal data in order to perform our contract with you. For example, we need to know your address and phone number in order to operate your account. We also need some information so that we can comply with our legal obligations. For example, we need to know your credit history so we can assess your ability to repay the balance on your card and/or product to ensure that we are lending responsibly.
Where personal data is needed for these purposes, if you do not provide it we will not be able to perform our contract with you and may not be able to offer you a card and/or product. If you do not provide the requested information, we may continue to process your personal data for other purposes as set out in this notice.
How and why do we grant third party providers (TPP) access to your online servicing account?
A TPP is a third party service provider that is authorised or registered with the Financial Conduct Authority or another European Economic Area regulator or otherwise permitted by law to carry on certain activities on your instruction. These include:
accessing information about your account held with us if it is accessible online; and
initiating payments from your account held with us if it is accessible online.
If you choose to use a TPP, please ensure you understand how their services work, such as how they access your account with us and how they will protect your information including your personal data. Please also be aware that:
If you use a TPP, the terms of your card and/or product will still apply.
If a TPP is only asking for information about your account (and is not initiating a payment from your account with us), we will assume you have given your consent to us providing the information to that particular TPP and we will provide the information immediately.
If the TPP is a card issuer who asks us to confirm whether you have sufficient credit for it to initiate a card payment from your account, we will only do so if you have given us your explicit consent to provide information to that particular TPP.
Although you must not, generally, give your security details to anyone else, you may give them to a TPP if it is necessary to do so.
We may refuse to allow a TPP to access your account if we are concerned about unauthorised or fraudulent access by that TPP. If we do this, we will tell you why (unless doing so would compromise our reasonable security measures or otherwise be unlawful).
You must check the information provided to you by the TPP, to ensure that they are authorised or permitted by law to provide payment services to you. If we become aware that an unauthorised third party is using your security details, we may block access to your account.
How long do we retain your personal data for?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as it is required in relation to the purposes it was obtained for by us as detailed in this notice. The periods for which we hold your personal data are set out below:
When you have an account with us; we only keep details of your personal information and details of your account for such period of time as is necessary to permit us to comply with any legal or statutory obligations after your account is closed and as may be required to enable us to establish or defend any legal claims that may arise in relation to your account.
When you apply for an account but are declined credit; we will keep your personal data for statistical analysis, fraud prevention and credit scoring purposes. If you have consented to receiving marketing from us, in the event your application is declined, we will continue to retain your personal data in order to send marketing to you.
Please note that you can withdraw your consent to receive marketing from us at any time by contacting Customer Services, using the unsubscribe link in any email we send you or in your Bip app under My account. Please see
Section 17
for more information about how we use your personal data for profiling,
Section 19
about the right to object to the processing of your personal data and
Section 20
about where we rely on your consent to process your personal data;
FPAs can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years by them. For more details about how long FPAs hold your personal data please contact us by calling our Compliance Team on
0371 522 5146

What measures do we have in place to safeguard your personal data?
We know how important it is to keep your personal data secure. We protect your personal data when being transferred and when stored in IT systems.
A variety of technologies are employed to protect the systems that are used to store and manage personal data. To protect our systems and networks from attack we use firewalls, encrypted hard drives, antivirus software, host based intruder detection software and authenticated access protection solutions. Our security solutions are designed in line with industry standards to protect the personal data we store or transmit.
Access to personal information is strictly controlled. We ensure access to personal data is restricted to individuals on a need to know basis. Training is provided to individuals working within the group who need to access personal data to ensure that personal data is managed securely.
When we share your personal data with third parties and organisations as set out in
Section 6
we undertake appropriate due diligence with them to ensure they are complying with the terms of their contract.
When do we transfer your personal data overseas?
We and third parties with whom we share personal data with may transfer your personal data overseas so that we can manage your account and provide other services from countries within the European Economic Area (
EEA
) (where similar data protection standards apply as in the UK) and countries outside the EEA. When personal data is transferred to countries outside of the UK and the EEA those countries may not offer an equivalent level of protection for personal information to the laws in the UK. Where this is the case we and those third parties will ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place to protect your personal information. For example, whenever FPAs transfer your personal data outside of the UK and the EEA, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that personal data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the UK. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to 'international frameworks' intended to enable secure data sharing.
When we transfer personal data to Mastercard, Mastercard have binding corporate rules in place to safeguard your personal data. A link to the Mastercard binding corporate rules can be found by
clicking here then select "Binding Corporate Rules"
(Opens in new tab or window)
.
We may process payments through other financial institutions such as banks and the worldwide payments system operated by the SWIFT organisation. These external organisations may process and store your personal data abroad in order to fulfil any payment instructions for example when you use your card and/or product. Additionally, the SWIFT organisation has to disclose your personal data to overseas authorities to help them to prevent and detect crime and terrorism. If these authorities are outside the UK and the EEA, your personal information may not be protected to the same standards as in the UK.
The countries to which your personal data is transferred and the safeguards in place where personal data are transferred outside the UK and the EEA are set out below:
United Kingdom
Germany (EEA)
Ireland (EEA)
Netherlands (EEA)
Poland (EEA)
USA
India
Canada
Australia
France (EEA)
Spain (EEA)
South Africa
Iceland (EEA)
The safeguards that we rely on to protect personal data that is transferred outside of the UK and the EEA include:
European Commission approved model contract clauses. Further details about the model contract clauses is available here:

How do I find out about cookies?
We are committed to protecting your personal data (anonymous or otherwise) that we collect about you online.
Our Cookies Notice
explains how we use cookies, why, and how this allows us to improve our service. It also tells you how you can manage what cookies are stored on your device. Please read the Cookies Notice to find out more.
Why do we use credit scoring and automated decision making as part of your application?
When you check your eligibility with us or apply to us for credit we may use an automated system known as credit scoring to help us decide whether to lend to you. It is a way of assessing how much you are able to afford to borrow and how you are likely to manage your account. Most lenders use credit scoring to help make fair and informed decisions about lending.
Credit scoring takes account of information from three sources:
The information you give us on your application;
Information provided by CRAs and FPAs, including information about how you manage similar accounts; and
Information that may already be held about you by us.
Credit scoring methods are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased. Using credit scoring helps us to lend responsibly.
You have rights in relation to automated decision making. Please see
Section 19
for more details of these rights.
How do we use your personal data for profiling?
We use various profiling techniques to assist us with running our business. By "profiling" we mean the automated analysis of personal data about an individual to evaluate certain things about that individual - basically drawing conclusions about an individual based on a statistical model.
We use these techniques for instance in the course of evaluating applications for cards and/or products, to manage your account, to guard against fraud and for marketing and targeted advertising purposes.
You have a right to object in relation to profiling. Please see
Section 19.1.7
for more details of this right
.
How do we use your personal data if you are an additional cardholder?
If you are an additional cardholder, we will ask the primary cardholder to provide us with your name, date of birth, email address, phone number and confirmation that you are 18 or over and live at the same address as the primary cardholder. We use this information to issue and send out your card and PIN and to verify your online transactions. The legal basis that we rely on to process your personal data is because it is in our legitimate interests to obtain your information to enable us to issue a card to you.
We will keep your personal data confidential and only share it with other third parties and organisations for the purposes explained below:

You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data, these include the right to:
Information
- Be informed about how we use your personal data;
Access
- Obtain access to your personal data that we hold;
Rectification
- Request that your personal data is corrected if you believe it is incorrect or incomplete;
Erasure
- You do not have a blanket right to ask for deletion of your data. A request that we erase your personal data is only valid in the following circumstances:
If we are continuing to process personal data beyond the period when it is necessary to do so for the purpose for which it was originally collected;
If we are relying on consent as the legal basis for processing and you withdraw consent;
If we are relying on legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing and you object to this processing and there is no overriding compelling ground which enables us to continue with the processing;
If the personal data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in breach of the requirements of the data protection legislation); or
If it is necessary to delete the personal data to comply with a legal obligation
Restriction
- Ask us to restrict our data processing activities where you consider that:
Personal data is inaccurate;
Our processing of your personal data is unlawful;
Where we no longer need the personal data but you require us to keep it to enable you to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; or
Where you have raised an objection to our use of your personal data.
Portability
- Request a copy of certain personal data that you have provided to us in a commonly used electronic format. This right relates to personal data that you have provided to us that we need in order to perform our agreement with you and personal data where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
Objection
- Object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying on legitimate interests or exercise of a public interest task to make the processing lawful. If you raise an objection, we will carry out an assessment to determine whether we have an overriding legitimate ground which entitles us to continue to process your personal data. If you object to us using your personal data for marketing purposes, we will always stop such use of your data.
Automated decisions
- Not be subject to automated decisions which produce legal effects or which could have a similarly significant effect on you.
As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated processes. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if:
our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct; or is inconsistent with your previous submissions; or
you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.
If you apply to us for credit but we are unable to offer you credit, you can contact us within 21 days of the date of your application to ask to have the decision reconsidered.
We will always tell you about the outcome of a request you have made in relation to the rights discussed above (except in relation to changes in marketing preferences, which are mostly automated).
