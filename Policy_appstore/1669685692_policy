3.2
Geolocation in our Shopping Centres
General principle
Subject to your consent given in the App, information related to your location within our Shopping Centre may be collected and processed by us while you are authenticated on our App for the purposes of providing you with location related services.
Geolocation will only take place if you have activated the additional services/specific function in the settings of your downloaded App on your mobile device. You could deactivate those additional services at any time in the settings.
Please note that when given, your consent will be effective immediately for any further connections on our App and for any further visits in our Shopping Centre within 12 months from first connection, unless you withdraw your consent.
To take part in certain challenges, you may be asked to activate geolocation on your mobile device. If this is the case, this request will be linked to the specific nature of the challenge in which you are taking part (for example, to count the number of steps taken in our centres). In any event, the activation of geolocation will not be automatic and will require your specific agreement.
How to manage your geolocation preferences on your mobile device
In order to be located within the Shopping Centre, you will be required to activate the Bluetooth feature on your mobile device.
If you only want to check out the map, the activation of the Bluetooth feature is not required.
Please note that we will not locate you outside our Shopping Centre. The location option is carried out by the Bluetooth beacons which are installed in the common areas of the Shopping Centre only.
You may disable the geolocation of your mobile device through your mobile settings at any time.
3.3 Specific case: step counter challenge
The step counter challenge is a game that involves taking the greatest number of steps during the game. The number of steps you take during the day is counted using an app (native for iOS or downloadable for Androids). At the end of the game, the Shopping Centre will reward the participant(s) who have counted the highest number of steps.
If you decide to take part in a step counter challenge in a Shopping Centre, you need to h
ave a smartphone equipped with an app that counts the number of steps. This app is native for iOS. For Androids, you will need to download the Health Connect app and synchronize it with the "Health" app of your choice. Apps compatible with Health Connect can be found
here
.
To access the rules of the challenges and to know the detailed terms and conditions of the current challenges (i.e. which Shopping Centre is eligible, when the challenge takes place, if there is a reward, etc.), please refer to the App.
4/ How do we share your personal data?
In accordance with your choices, each Data Controller has access to your personal data (see
article 1
above).
In addition, we may share your personal data with:

as listed
here

·
any competent authority or legal entity to answer to legal or regulatory requests, court orders, subpoena or legal process, if necessary to comply with applicable laws;

5/ How do we keep your personal data secure?
We take the security of all the personal data we process very seriously and we are committed to protecting your personal data. We have therefore implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures, and have chosen our providers accordingly.
We have entered into specific data processing agreements with each of our service providers that qualify as a processor and have checked their general technical and organizational measures. The service providers are only authorized to process your personal data, as data processor, in compliance with the provision of this Privacy Notice, only on our behalf and according to our instructions. We cannot control all the risks related to the use of the Internet, and data security also relies on everyone's vigilance and good use of these technologies, therefore we invite you to remain highly vigilant on potential inherent risks while using Internet services.

6.1 Transfer to the Local Data Controller
Depending on your usage of the Services, in particular if you subscribe to the newsletter of a Shopping Centre located in the USA and/or if you select a Preferred Shopping Centre located in the USA, your personal data may be transferred, in the conditions explained in
article 1
, to the
Local Data Controller
in the USA, a country whose legislation has not been recognized by the European Commission or the UK Secretary of State as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data.
In that respect, we have implemented between our companies the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (as amended by the UK Addendum issued by the UK Information Commissioner, where relevant) to secure such transfer.
6.2 Transfer to our service providers
We use third party service providers that help us provide the Services to you and process your personal data on our behalf. Such third party service providers will always be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Notice and the applicable law.
Note that some of our third party service providers that may process your personal data are located outside the EEA and the UK in countries whose legislation has not been recognized by the European Commission or the UK Secretary of State as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data. Therefore, we have implemented with such providers the appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data benefits from an adequate level of protection when accessed and processed from such countries, i.e., we have entered into the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (as amended by the UK Addendum issued by the UK Information Commissioner, where relevant) or, where applicable, our providers rely on Binding Corporate Rules approved by the relevant authority.
