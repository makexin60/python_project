VIII.	Security and Retention.
We use commercially reasonable administrative, organizational, technical and physical security controls to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, or destruction. However, we are not able to guarantee that your Personal Information is absolutely secure, since no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. You should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via our Services or when you communicate with us through email, SMS/texts, chat, or other modes of communication. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Services or those on third-party websites. Please recognize that protecting your Personal Information is also your responsibility and we urge you to take precautions to protect your Personal Information. If you have reason to believe that your DoorDash account or any interaction with us is no longer secure please let us know immediately by contacting DoorDash support or as indicated below in Section XII (How to Contact Us) of this Policy.
We retain your Personal Information for only as long as required to provide our Services to you and engage in the uses described in this Policy, unless a different retention period is required by applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the type of Personal Information being processed, along with:
The time necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected the information;
The duration and status of your relationship or connection with us, including whether your account is active;
Any retention period required for our compliance with legal, regulatory, or government requirements, including the period during which civil claims or regulatory actions may be filed or otherwise commenced and the period needed to resolve ongoing legal proceedings; and
Our internal obligations, contractual commitments, including with Merchants, and other requirements.
