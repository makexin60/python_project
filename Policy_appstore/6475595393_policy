FaceSwap Creative Studio Privacy Policy
FaceSwap Creative Studio is an easy-to-use app for swapping faces, making it fun to create cool content. We care about your privacy and promise to keep your info safe. We only use your personal stuff to provide our services, and we'll always ask for your permission first.
When you use our app, you agree to follow our Privacy Policy along with our Terms of Use. We might update our Privacy Policy now and then.
Here's a quick summary of how we handle your privacy:
FaceSwap Creative Studio is all about editing photos and videos to switch faces in a realistic way.
Any pictures or videos you upload to our app are only used for editing them inside the app.
While we're editing your stuff, we temporarily store it on secure cloud servers and keep it safe with encryption on your phone.
1. Information We Collect
1.1. Content Selection and Processing
When you use FaceSwap Creative Studio and choose photos or videos to edit, we temporarily store them to carry out the editing service you requested:
The specific photos or videos you pick for editing in the app. We only work with the chosen content and don't access your entire photo or video library (including face data), even if you've given us permission. Each chosen photo or video is encrypted and stored locally on your device, ensuring that only your device can access it.
It's worth noting that we don't ask for or need any metadata associated with the photos or videos you select for editing. However, metadata like geotags might be automatically added to your photos or videos. We take steps to remove any attached metadata from the content you provide while using the app.
1.2. Additional Information Gathering
When you use FaceSwap Creative Studio and visit our website, we may collect various information, including:
Data about how you use the app and what you do online, like your interactions with the app, language preferences, when you install and open the app, and how you found our website.
Some of this data might also be collected by third parties, like online advertising networks and their partners, as you browse other websites and use other mobile apps. We collect this info using technologies like cookies, browser storage, and similar methods.
Information about your app purchases, which confirms that you've paid for a subscription to the app. We don't get into specifics like billing addresses or credit card details.
Details about your device, such as what kind of operating system you use, what device you have, unique IDs for your apps, advertising IDs, browser types, screen sizes, IP addresses (and where they're located), and the website you were on before you came to ours.
Keep in mind that usually, only online identifiers like IP addresses, App Instance IDs (each copy of the app on your device gets one), and Advertising IDs count as personal data. But we can't directly figure out who you are just from these identifiers.
1.3. Contacting Us via Email
If you have any questions or need more info about how we collect data, feel free to get in touch with us. We're committed to addressing your concerns because your privacy is super important to us.
2. How We Use Your Information
At FaceSwap Creative Studio, we take your privacy seriously and only use the info you give us to provide our face-swapping features. We promise never to use your videos, photos, or facial features (like face data) for things like face recognition or any other biometric methods meant to identify or authenticate users.
Here's how we might use other info we collect, excluding videos, photos, or facial features:
Improving, testing, and seeing how well our services work.
Finding and fixing technical problems, making sure everything runs smoothly.
Making our technology more secure and safe.
Studying how people use our services and spotting trends.
Trying out new features and making sure they work well.
Customizing our services and ads to match what you like and need.
Using data from cookies and similar tech to make your experience with our services better.
The content you upload is collected so you can use our services easily and conveniently. This content is saved on your device and in the cloud for a while, but only while you're using our services. By sending content to swap, you're giving us permission to collect and store it as described here. Don't worry, we'll never use your uploaded content for things like face recognition or any other biometric methods meant to identify or authenticate users.
If we decide to change how we use your info, we'll let you know ahead of time. And if the law says we need your separate permission to use your personal info in new ways, we'll ask for it.

Additionally, if legally required, we will notify you of changes through alternative means reasonably likely to reach you, such as through the app.
All changes to this Privacy Policy take effect when we post the new terms on the website and/or implement the changes on the app and website (or as indicated at the time of posting). Your continued use of our services after any updated Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised terms.
