3. The protection of your personal data
We have implemented a number of security measures to ensure that our processing of personal data is secure and to protect the personal data we process against unauthorized access, unauthorized processing and misuse. For example, access to the systems in which personal data is stored is limited to our employees and service providers who need to access the data in the context of their duties. They are also informed of the importance of maintaining the security of the personal data. We also continuously monitor our systems to detect vulnerabilities and to protect your personal data.
4. With whom may we share your personal data?
FTo enable us to provide our services and conduct marketing activities, we share your personal data with third parties. For this purpose, the following applies.
a) Service providers that we use in certain parts of our business, including the processing of personal data; We share personal data with these providers mainly for IT operational services (such as data storage, support, maintenance and development), payment services and marketing services such as conducting customer surveys and administering marketing mailings.
b) Information service providers and partners; We share personal data with these providers and partners in order to deliver your purchased goods.
c) IT security providers; We share personal data with IT security providers when this is necessary by law, to protect you or our customers and partners or to protect our services.
d) Government authorities (such as the police, the Swedish Tax Agency and other authorities); We share personal data with authorities if we are required to do so by law or in case of suspicion of a crime.
Most of the third parties with whom we share personal data as described above are, in relation to us, so-called data processors. They may only process the transferred data on our behalf and in accordance with our explicit instructions. We only transfer your personal data to such data processors for purposes that are compatible with the purposes for which we have collected the data, and we ensure through written agreements with the data processors that they undertake to comply with our security requirements and restrictions as well as requirements regarding the international transfer of personal data.
Authorities and companies to which we transfer personal data as described above may be independent controllers of the transferred data. When your personal data is transferred to someone who is an independent data controller, we do not control how the data is then processed, but the responsibility for this then falls on the authority or company to which the transfer has been made, which means, among other things, that the authority or company is obliged to inform you about its processing of your personal data and to ensure that the processing is legal.
5. Where we process your personal data
We aim to always process your personal data within the EU/EEA where all our own IT systems are located. However, it may happen that your personal data is shared with data processors who either themselves or through subcontractors are established or store information in a country outside the EU/EEA. In such cases, we will take all reasonable legal, organizational and technical measures necessary to ensure that the level of protection for that processing is equivalent to that within the EU/EEA.
6. Your rights as a data subject
This section describes your rights as a data subject. You can always enforce these rights by contacting dataskydd@convini.se.
6.1 Right of access
If you wish to receive information about what personal data we process about you, you can request access to the data. The information will then be provided in the form of a register extract indicating what personal data we process, for what purposes we process them, where the data has been obtained from, which third parties the data has been transferred to and how long the data will be stored. If your request is made in electronic form, the information will be provided in a commonly used electronic format, unless you request otherwise.
6.2 Right to rectification
You have the right to have inaccurate data concerning you rectified without delay. You also have the right to have incomplete data completed.
6.3 Right of deletion
You have the right to have your personal data erased without delay if any of the following occurs:
a) the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
b) you withdraw your consent for processing based on consent and there is no other legal basis for the processing;
c) you object to processing based on a legitimate interest and your reason for objecting outweighs our legitimate interest;
d) the personal data has been processed unlawfully;
e) the personal data must be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation.
6.4 Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted if any of the following options apply:
a) you contest the accuracy of the personal data for a period that allows us to verify the accuracy of the data; or
b) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the data and request a restriction of their use instead; or
c) we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing but you need them for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims;
d) you have objected to processing based on a balance of interests and we check whether our legitimate interests outweigh your legitimate interests.
Where processing has been restricted in accordance with this paragraph, personal data subject to restriction of processing, with the exception of storage, shall only be processed for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of third parties or for reasons of substantial public interest of the EU or of an EU Member State.
6.5 Right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes
You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This right to object also covers the analysis of personal data (so-called profiling) carried out for direct marketing purposes.
6.6 Right to data portability
Where our processing of personal data is based on your consent or fulfillment of a contract, you have the right to request that the data that you have provided to us be transferred to another data controller. However, a prerequisite for this is that the transfer is technically possible and that it can be transferred in an automated manner.
6.7 Withdrawal of consent
In cases where our processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you always have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Such withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal. If you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process the personal data based on the consent, unless we are legally obliged to continue processing them. Should our legal obligations prevent us from erasing your data, we will instead mark it so that it is no longer actively used in our systems.
					You can send an email to dataskydd@convini.se at any time to withdraw your consent. We will respond to your request promptly.
6.8 The right to file a complaint
If you believe that we process your personal data incorrectly, you can, in addition to contacting us, file a complaint with the Swedish Data Protection Authority, see www.datainspektionen.se.
