Device and Activity Information
Your fitness tracking device or mobile smartphone collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like your steps, distance traveled and active minutes moved. Not every device tracks every one of these metrics. The data collected varies depending on the device you use. When your device syncs with our applications and software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device or device app to our service.
When you pair your device to your account, you grant us access to your exercise or activity data from that device service. You can use your account settings and tools to withdraw this consent at any time by stopping use of a feature, removing our access to a third-party service, unpairing your device, or deleting your data or your account.
Location Information
We collect your timezone. This is either gathered from your mobile device, your connected fitness device or is manually set by you. We use timezone to allow challenges to start and end locally at the same time for everyone participating in the challenge. You can change your timezone at any time in your profile settings.
