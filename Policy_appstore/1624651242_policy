Your privacy is critically important to us. At SessionBox we
            have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand
                services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the
                law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the
                on-going operation of one of our services.
If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact
            our support team.
Extension and Application Users and Website Visitors
Like most website and extension, SessionBox collects non-personally-identifying
            information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SessionBox’s purpose in
            collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SessionBox’s visitors use its
            website and its browser extensions. From time to time, SessionBox may release non-personally-identifying
            information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website and its
            extensions.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain users of SessionBox’s extensions and website choose to interact with SessionBox
            in ways that require SessionBox to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
            information that SessionBox gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users who
            sign up for a SessionBox account to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with
            SessionBox – by upgrading their account, for example – are asked to provide additional information,
            including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In
            each case, SessionBox collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the
            purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SessionBox. SessionBox does not disclose personally-identifying
            information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
            information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.
Aggregated Statistics
SessionBox may collect statistics about the behavior of users to its extensions and its
            website. SessionBox may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SessionBox does
            not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
SessionBox discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
            that information in order to process it on SessionBox’s behalf or to provide services available at
            SessionBox’s extensions and website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
            employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
            SessionBox’s extensions and website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SessionBox
            will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
            Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SessionBox
            discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
            subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SessionBox believes in good faith that
            disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SessionBox, third parties or the
            public at large. If you are a registered user of SessionBox and have supplied your email address, SessionBox
            may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
            up to date with what’s going on with SessionBox and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs
            to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send
            us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right
            to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
            SessionBox takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
            alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and
            that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. SessionBox uses cookies to
            help SessionBox identify and track users, their usage of SessionBox extensions and website, and their
            extension access preferences. SessionBox visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
            should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using SessionBox’s websites, with the drawback that
            certain features of SessionBox’s extensions may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Third-Party Cookies and Storage data
SessionBox is handling cookies and storage data from third-party websites to provide
            its main functionality. All third-party cookies and storage data are stored and transferred in encrypted
            format. Cookies and storage data are encrypted and decrypted at the device level. Cookies and storage data
            stored by SessionBox is kept secret, even from SessionBox employees.
Business Transfers
If SessionBox, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely
            event that SessionBox goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets
            that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
            any acquirer of SessionBox may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
