Foursaken Media Privacy Policy

Last updated: Jan 1, 2017

Your privacy is an important matter. This notice explains how and why our applications use your information.

We do not collect information about you that can personally identify you. That means we do not collect your name, address, phone number, or email address.

We do not collect your exact geographic location. We may read your general geographic location (example: North America East), to better your experience. For example, to choose the best default language or to choose the best multiplayer server.

Ad companies may collect and analyze anonymous data about your interests to custom tailor your ad experiences. These data are not linked to your identity, but they may be linked to your device.

We may read your friends list when logged into various game services (Google Play Games, Gamecenter), which we use to allow you to invite your friends to play a game with you. 

We may use unique device identifiers to anonymously identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience.

Ad services and analytics we use may also use anonymous device identifiers in order to track patterns related to how you use our apps. For example, how many times our app was booted up, how long play sessions are, how many IAPs were purchased, etc. All of the data collected in this manner is anonymous.
