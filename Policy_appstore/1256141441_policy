8.
COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
A.
Cookies, Generally
.
“
Cookies
” are small pieces of data (often text files) that are placed on your computer or device by our  services that you visit or our partners. As a standard feature of major browser applications, cookies are widely used to make online services work or operate more efficiently, as well as to provide info to the providers of those online services about your browsing experiences. When you return to those same online services again, your browser sends the previously stored cookies back to the online service which allows it to recognize you and remember important info to make your use of the online services more personalized or convenient, such as by remembering your saved preferences, keeping items in your cart, or keeping you logged-in to our forum.
We and our partners also use other technologies, including data stored on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software for similar purposes. This includes the following:
Pixel tags:
Pixel tags (also called beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage, email, app, or ads which can retrieve certain info about your device and browser and how you interact with it. This includes, for example, information about your device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address, whether you’ve opened an email or clicked on an ad, and other similar info, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect info about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner.
Local storage:
This refers generally to other places on a browser or device where info can be stored by websites, ads, or third parties (such as HTML5 local storage and browser cache).
Software development kits (“SDKs”):
Software development kits (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. Pieces of code (the SDK) are installed in the app that allow us and our partners to collect certain info about your interaction with the app and info about your device and network.
IP address:
IP address is the short form for Internet Protocol address which is assigned by internet access providers to every computer that is connected to the internet. Website owners have access to IP addresses of their users. Using IP addresses, we and our partners can identify the country, state and city from which a computer is connecting to the Internet. IP addresses are, for example, used for IP geolocation purposes.
Device identifiers:
We may also collect unique device identifiers or create a unique device fingerprint (this is a unique combination of different information from your device so that we can single it out) so we can identify your device. We may then use this in a similar way to cookies.
In this policy, we refer to all of these and similar technologies as “cookies.” These technologies can be used to recognize when your device does things. For instance, they may recognize when you visit pages on our or others’ sites, use parts of an app or when you open emails we send you, or links in technologies.
B.

DATA TRANSFERS
A.
Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) Program
.
We conform and adhere to the DPF Program set forth by the US Department of Commerce. We store your personal information in the United States of America. Our processing of this information complies with the Privacy Policy Framework regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the DPF Program, the DPF Program will govern. To learn more about the DPF Program and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
In the event we transfer your personal information to a third party, we will remain liable under the DPF Program where such personal information is transmitted in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Program unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the DPF Program, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF), we provide a dispute resolution mechanism through JAMS Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) for European Union, United Kingdom, and individual Swiss complaints.
If you are a European Union, United Kingdom, or Swiss individual and believe you have a claim concerning the collection, use, and retention of your personal information, please contact us at
privacy@telltalegames.com
so that we can attempt to resolve your complaint in compliance with the mediation terms set forth in the Mediation section below. If we fail to satisfy your complaint after meaningful mediation, you may contact JAMS to begin the process of opening a Data Privacy case. Your case must address an alleged breach of one or more of the DPF Program principles.
B.
Standard Contractual Clauses
.
We will rely on EU Standard Contractual clauses and other safeguards to enable transfers outside these areas if we transfer information from European (re. European Economic Area), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland.
16.
RESOLVING DISPUTES
Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) refers to the different ways people can resolve disputes without a trial. We will comply with JAMS ADR procedures specified in the JAMS International Mediation Rules, available at
https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution
. JAMS Mediation will be conducted in English in Santa Monica County, California, before one mediator who is selected under such rules and procedures. All documents submitted to such mediation will be in English. The dispute may also be referred to US Federal Trade Commission, which has DPF Program investigatory and enforcement powers over us.
We strive to provide our users with the best possible experience and to resolve any issues that may arise in a fair and transparent manner. If you have concerns with how we are handling your personal data, please email us through our dedicated channel, at
privacy@telltalegames.com
, so that we can attempt to resolve your complaint. If we can’t come to a resolution, you can use the independent recourse mechanism provided under the DPF Framework, which is free of charge for you. If that doesn’t work, you can raise the issue with your Data Protection Authority, who will then work with the Department of Commerce to resolve the issue. However, there are certain conditions that must be met before you can do this, and some restrictions apply. In the unlikely event that you have a dispute or claim arising out of this Privacy Policy or your relationship with us, we offer a process for resolving the issue through mediation and binding arbitration.
Mediation is the first step in the process, and it provides an opportunity for both parties to discuss and try to resolve the issue with the help of a neutral third-party mediator. If the dispute or claim cannot be resolved through mediation, the matter will proceed to binding arbitration.
To initiate the mediation process, either you or we may communicate with JAMS (and the other respective party) a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will then cooperate with JAMS and one another in selecting a mediator from the JAMS panel of neutrals and scheduling the mediation proceedings.
If you need to contact JAMS to initiate mediation or arbitration, you can visit their Website at
www.jamsadr.com
to find contact information for their various offices and to submit a request for mediation or arbitration online. You can also contact JAMS by phone at
800-352-5267
to speak with a representative who can assist you in initiating the process. When submitting a request for mediation or arbitration, be sure to include a detailed description of the dispute or claim and the relief you are seeking. JAMS will then work with both parties to select a mediator or arbitrator and schedule the mediation or arbitration proceedings.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the DPF Program website available at
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/program-articles/FAQs%E2%80%93General
, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. If mediation is unsuccessful, you or we may initiate arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration. Arbitration is a legal process where a neutral third-party arbitrator will make a final and binding decision on the dispute or claim. The process is quicker and less formal than going to court, and it allows both parties to avoid the expenses and stress of a lawsuit. Any arbitration will take place in the state of California and will be governed by the laws of the State of California.
We hope that you will not need to use this process, but we want you to know that we are committed to resolving any issues that may arise in a fair and transparent manner.
