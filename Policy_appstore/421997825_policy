PRIVACY POLICY FOR GAMES
Updated October 21, 2024
ABOUT US AND THIS PRIVACY POLICY
Your privacy is very important to us, and we will always use your personal information only for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy for Games (the "Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy sets out the privacy practices Outfit7 Limited and its subsidiaries (referred to as "Outfit7", "we", "us" or "our", "ours") follow in the "Outfit7" branded software applications (the "Game/s"), which may operate on any type of computing device, and applies to your interaction with the Game(s), and is a part of, and incorporated by reference, into the End User License Agreement ("EULA"). EULA is available at
https://talkingtomandfriends.com/eula/
. Additional information is available for players who come from certain regions:

You can always determine your country of residence in the app settings by clicking a "Country" button and selecting your country.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU
Most of the information that we collect about you comes from you or your device when you play our Games, interact with third-party ads in our Games, or interact with our ads in apps or websites of others. Other than that, we may receive your information when you contact us directly via email. Some data is provided directly by you, whereas other data is collected automatically.
We follow the data minimization standards when collecting information, meaning that we'll only collect information necessary for a certain purpose and not reuse it for a different, undisclosed purpose.
Information you provide directly
If you decide to contact us directly via email, we will use your data solely to respond to your inquiry. You may also be asked to participate in a survey or testing of our Games - which is all voluntary; please read more about this in the section
Participation in the testing and surveys
. Other than in these cases, we do not collect any "traditional" personal information through our Games (such as your name or email address, with which you could be personally identified directly).
If you are in any way engaging with User Generated Content, note that no information is collected from you from the Game; please read more information about this in our Social Media Engagement Policy, accessible at
https://talkingtomandfriends.com/social-policy
.
For some of our Games we collect information about the nickname you choose or information about the name you give to your virtual pet and your rating of the Game (if any). Please do not use your real name. Please note that if you are a Child (as defined below) your nickname is only shown to you and not to any other players in order to provide an additional layer of safety.
Information collected automatically
The information we automatically collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you play our Games, how you interact with our ads, and third-party ads. This includes your approximate geolocation and online identifiers, which do not identify you personally but may uniquely identify your device, and other device data. We may also collect information from app store platforms, partners and other third parties, such as information about your interests and in-app purchases (but we never receive your payment or credit card information).
We also ask you to submit, and we may process, other non-personally identifiable information that may be personal to you - like your year of birth.

HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
We use and share your information to provide you with Games and to run a successful operation. As described in greater detail below, we may share your information (including personal data) with our subsidiaries and with other companies and use it for the purposes as described below.
Providing You with Games and Support
We use the information we collect about you/your device to provide Games to you and to operate our business. Your information is used to develop, deliver and improve our Games and video content, to provide Game updates, and fix any bugs and crashes that may occur.
We use your information to provide timely and accurate customer support to you and to respond to your inquiries. In case we are contacted by Children, we will delete all the communication, including any personal information included, after a one-time response.
To learn more about who your data is shared with, please expand this section.
Learn more
Analytics and Research
We use your information to understand and analyze trends in connection with the usage of our Games, gather demographic information about our user base, and data about where the Game was downloaded from. We may also create reports and analysis for the purposes of research or business intelligence. We also analyze how you play our Games - how often and for how long you play, how you progress through the Game and which events occur in the game. We also use your information to improve Games and to enhance security.
To learn more about who your data is shared with, please expand this section.
Learn more
Advertising
We offer our Games for free or at low cost, which is possible because of the advertisements we show in the Games. When playing our Games, information from your device is collected and used by us and other companies so that ads may be delivered and displayed to you. Information may be logged from your device using different technologies, such as Software Developer Kits (SDKs) or web beacons, to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Game and to calculate the number of ads shown to you and how you interact with them.
You can read more about the types of advertisements we show in the Games and which of your information is used for each type below.
Learn more
Please read more about interest-based advertising practices and the choices you have in regards to them in the Interest-based Ads Notices link currently available at
talkingtomandfriends.com/privacy-general/iba-notices
. We never allow advertising providers to show interest-based (personalised) ads to Children (as defined below).
To learn more about who your data is shared with, please expand this section.
Learn more
Advertisement of our Games
When you use other apps or other online services, you may see ads for our Games in them. When you use these other online services, you are subject to the terms and privacy practices of the online service provider you are using at the time.
Information from your device is used to attribute performance of our advertising campaigns, to assess and measure their success, and to identify and prevent any fraud. We also use certain information from your device to
not
show you repetitive advertisements or ads for those of our Games which you have already installed. In addition, information on how you play our Games and how you interact with the ads may also be used and shared with advertising providers to optimize our advertising campaigns and to show our ads to the audience that may be more interested in our Games. If you would like to know more about the choices you have regarding the sharing of your information for these purposes, read our Interest-based Ads Notices available at
talkingtomandfriends.com/privacy-general/iba-notices
.
Information from your device may be logged using SDKs, cookies, web beacons and other technologies. These technologies enable us or other companies we've partnered with to check how you interact with ads and attribute views, impressions, clicks, installs or other performance indicators.
We check data like impressions, downloads and traffic sources to see how many times people viewed or downloaded our Games from the app stores. The device data used and shared with providers for this purpose are encoded. The providers assign a random ID to this data and they are not able to match it back to you personally. We also aggregate this data for benchmarking.
To learn more about who your data is shared with, please expand this section.
Learn more
Cross promotion of our Games
We use some of the information we automatically collect from you (read more about the collection of information in the section
Information Collected Automatically
of this Privacy Policy) for cross promoting our Games, which means we promote one of our Games while you are playing a different Game of ours.
Game Notifications
We use game notifications to remind you about your activities within the Game. We have two types of notifications in our Games - local and push notifications. Local notifications are contextual and sent from the device, whereas push notifications are sent from the server.
If you decide to receive push notifications, we get your push notification token so we know we can send them to you. To read more about how you can unsubscribe from receiving push notifications at any time, find the instructions by expanding this section.
Learn more
Participation in the testing and surveys
We are conducting surveys to improve our Games or customer support service. If any of your personal data may be processed for these purposes and if your local legislation requires consent as the legal basis for the processing of information obtained in the course of the survey, we will always ask for your consent before conducting a survey.
From time to time, we, or our partners, may conduct an in-app survey and collect demographic and usage information for the purposes of internal analysis, marketing and brand development. We will use the information to create a better user experience. Collected information shall be anonymized and aggregated.
Participating in any survey is completely voluntary.
In some territories we may invite you to participate in the testing of our Games.
You may voluntarily decide to apply.
If you do so, you will be directed out of the app to an online survey, where we will ask for your consent for the processing of any personal information we might need to be able to invite you to the testing of our Games. You can read more about our privacy practices in relation to the testing of our Games in the Privacy Policy for User Testing, which is currently available at
https://outfit7.com/user-testing-privacy-policy
.
App stores' game centers
Some of our Games enable you to connect to app stores' game centers, such as Google Play Games Service or Apple Game Center, where you may be able to participate in leaderboards. Gaming centers are governed by their own privacy policies, terms and end user agreements and we are not responsible for, and have no control over, the sharing practices or policies of such centers that operate those sites.
Learn more
Security and Legal Obligation
We use your information to enhance the safety and security of our Games, and where we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our users, user experience, or our operations. We use your information when we are required to do so by law and in order to comply with any legal requirements. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger or sale we may transfer any and all information (including personally identifiable information) we collect to the relevant successor.
In-App Purchases
Our Games enable in-app purchases. Payment transactions for in-app purchases are completed through the app store via your app store account.
We do not process payments for in-app purchases, nor do we have access to your credit card information.
Read more details about in-app purchases and refunds in our EULA, available here:
https://talkingtomandfriends.com/eula/en
.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
We consider ourselves to be family oriented and we take the privacy and safety of players below the age limit as required by the applicable data protection legislation ("Children/Child") under special consideration, hence we implemented higher protection standards to ensure this. Even though our products and services are not primarily directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from Children, with the sole exception of online identifiers, we have decided to voluntarily implement higher child protection standards, as described in this section.
If we learn that we have collected personal information, other than online identifier, of Children, we will take all reasonable steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If you become aware that your Child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at
privacy@outfit7.com
.
To preserve the family-friendly reputation of our Games, we age-gated some of the features in some of our Games, so that they are not available for use by Children.
Learn more
To read more details about how the information is used and shared in general, please see the section
How we use and share your information
of this Privacy Policy. For details about which companies we share information from Children,

.
Kids Privacy Assured Program
We voluntarily participate in kids privacy assured programs, which means our Games are inspected and certified by an independent third-party organization as being compliant with applicable privacy practices.
Learn more
SPECIAL FEATURES IN SOME OF OUR GAMES
In some of our Games there is an option for the virtual character to repeat back what you said to it. Before doing so, you will always be asked to give permission to access the microphone. Please note that none of our Games have the option to record audio - you can learn more below.
Learn more
In the US, some of our Games offer you the option to connect your device to an entertainment device, i.e. a talking, animatronic streamer GameBud™ Talking Tom® (the "Entertainment Device"). To read more about this, please expand this section.
Learn more
THIRD-PARTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Our Games may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services. For example, the Games may feature offers from third-party advertisers or the ability to engage in transactions with such entities. Please note that while using such third-party offerings, you are using sites, products, and services developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by us. We cannot control the actions of those people or companies, the content of their sites, products or services, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Our link to such third parties does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies. Nor is such linking an endorsement of such third-party's privacy or information security policies and practices, or their compliance with laws. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location information or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of third parties with which you interact.
TRANSFER, SECURITY AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION
Security of your personal information
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the collected information, and to prevent unauthorized access and the use of information contrary to this Privacy Policy. We regularly review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware that, despite our best commercially reasonable efforts to assure that your information remains secure when maintained by us, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
How long your information is stored for
We store your information for as long as needed to provide you with our Games. We may store information longer, but only in an aggregated and anonymized form - this means the information cannot be linked to you or your device. We delete the information as soon as we do not need it for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy and in any event no later than five (5) years after your interaction with all our Games has ceased.
When required by law, we will retain your information for as long as we are legally obligated to do so. If you request us to delete your data, we will delete your data as described below in the "Your Rights" section of the territory-specific privacy section of this Privacy Policy.
International transfer
We operate globally, so we may need to transfer your personal data to our affiliated entities and/or to other third-party service providers across borders and from your territory to other territories around the world. Please note that not all these territories may have the same data protection laws as your own territory, but we will always take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy and protection of your personal data.
Certain territories have safeguards in place which set out the rules on how the personal data from such places may be transferred to other territories. Please read more about such safeguards in the territory specific sections of this Privacy Policy below.
YOUR RIGHTS
You have certain rights in connection with your personal information and how we handle it. Some of these rights may be subject to some exceptions or limitations. You can exercise these rights at any time by sending your requests regarding your personal information to

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy as necessary to protect our users, furnish current information, and respond to legal and technical changes. We may also contract with additional companies or change existing service providers to perform any services in connection with the Games. These changes shall be updated twice a year or promptly in case of material changes in our data processing practices. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of your information and will be available at

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY
Expand all
Who are we?
We’re Outfit7 – we make the games you’ve been enjoying!
In this document – it’s called a
Privacy Policy
– we might talk about ourselves in a couple of different ways:
We
Us
Our
Ours
When we do that, we mean
Outfit7 Limited
– and all of our
subsidiaries.
Who are you?
You’re someone who plays our games and you live in one of the countries on this map!
Outfit7 Limited, a company registered at 1st Floor Sackville House, 143-149 Fenchurch Street, London EC3M 6BN, United Kingdom, with a business address at Christaki Kranou 20, 2nd Floor, 4041 Limassol, Cyprus. Contact us:
privacy@outfit7.com
Word of the day
“Subsidiary”
A subsidiary is a company that’s owned by a parent company.
So Outfit7 is a parent company – and we have subsidiary companies (or “subsidiaries”).
Who are you?
You’re someone who plays our games and you live in one of the countries on this map!
WHAT’S A PRIVACY POLICY?
When you play one of our games, we get some of your information – including
personal information.
Basically, a Privacy Policy is an explanation of how we will use your personal information.
But first…
Important things about you
There are some bits of
information about you
that are really important.
Your name
Your email or phone number
This is called
classical personal information.
It’s information that lets people know who you are – and
everyone should protect this information about themselves.
YOUR SECRET IDENTITY!
Imagine you’re a superhero… Like Super Tom!
Your classical personal information is like your secret identity.
For your own protection, you want to keep it secret and
only share it with the people you really trust.
You can play our games without giving us this information.
We want you to keep your secret identity safe!
So when you play games and you’re thinking about using an in-game nickname, or you want to give your virtual pet a name –
do not use your own name.
INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR DEVICE
Just like there’s information about you, there’s information about your device.
Some information about your device also counts as
personal
information
- even though it doesn’t say anything about you as a person.
Personal information is information that relates to YOU as described above, but it can also be information that can be used to identify YOUR DEVICE, such as IP address and some device identifiers.
Getting in touch with us
If you want to talk to us directly, your name and email address will be shared with us but they will only be used to reply to you. Once we have replied to you, we will delete your name and email address. Our customer support partner also gets your name and email address. After we use it to reply to you, we both delete your personal information immediately.
Before you get in touch with us, speak to your parent or legal guardian first to ask permission.
Device
What kind of device you’ve got
IP address
Device identifiers
Whether you’re connected to the internet and how you're connected
Other device data
This is technical device information (e.g. device model and name, operating system name and version, CPU information, storage size, screen size, firmware, software, API key).
Including: user agent string (UA), platform, SDK version, timestamp, and browser plugin types and versions.
Game
How long you play for
Whether you have any of our other games
This is technical device information (e.g. device model and name, operating system name and version, CPU information, storage size, screen size, firmware, software, API key).
Including: user agent string (UA), platform, SDK version, timestamp, and browser plugin types and versions.
Map
The country you’re in
The language spoken where you are
The time zone where you are
When you contact us
Name
Email address
A FEW MORE THINGS
We also create a special code name for you – called a unique user ID – which helps us know that it’s you. A unique user ID is needed so you can play the games and so we can see which features of the games you really like and which ones you don’t enjoy. We also use a unique user ID so we can restore your progress for you, in case you change your mobile phone or accidentally delete the game.
By the way:
If you have an older version of one of our games, it may still collect a couple other things – a Unique Device ID and an International Mobile Equipment Identity number.
Don’t want these collected? Just update the app and it’ll stop! Easy.
PHRASES OF THE DAY
“IP Address”
A special string of numbers – a kind of label – that can identify devices on a computer network.
For example, we use your IP address to determine which country you’re located in so we can show you games in your language.
”Device Identifiers”
Unique pieces of information that refer to a digital object. They include things like:
Device ID
IDFA
IDFV
Advertising ID
They don’t link to one specific person – like you – but they could,
over time
, help identify you
as a user, or your device.

HOW DOES YOUR INFORMATION GET COLLECTED?
There are a couple of ways it might get collected:
When you play our games
When you see or click on an ad in our games
When you see or click on one of our ads in someone else’s games
WHY DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION?
Information we get from you helps us keep our games working – and make them even more fun!
It helps us:
Develop and improve our apps and other products
Show you ads in our apps
Show you other apps we have
See how ads are working and make sure they are shown to you from our partners
Understand how you play our apps
Keep our games safe and secure
Answer your questions and help other players when they have questions
Obey the law
Develop and improve our apps and other products
We use information to make our products, deliver updates, fix problems, and keep our apps working.
Show you ads in our apps
To show ads for things you might like, based on the content you are watching or the game you are playing. These ads do not track you or build a picture of you or your habits.
Show you other apps we have
To show you some of our other games that you might want to play.
Understand how you play our apps
To understand how often you play the app, for how long you use the app, the events that occur within the app, in-app progress, in-app purchases you make and their value, aggregated usage, performance data, life time value of user etc ,and to help us see where problems are.
WHO SEES YOUR INFORMATION?
We can’t do everything ourselves. To make games that are fun and work well, we work with other companies. They are
our partners
. They help us with different tasks, like running our apps and showing ads, for example. You can find out more about who our partners are by
clicking here
.
Working together is important. We’re all better together.
When we work together, we share information.
That way, everyone has everything they need to do their jobs.
We share information with our partners that can personally identify your mobile phone or tablet.
But we don’t give them important information about you. They can’t identify you personally.
If you have any questions, please ask your parent or guardian to contact us on:
privacy@outfit7.com
WHAT DO OUR PARTNERS KNOW?
They know the information is about someone, but our partners don’t know it’s about
you
.
Remember we talked about you being a superhero like Super Tom? When he’s on a mission, the world sees a superhero called Super Tom. Only the people he trusts the most know that his real name is Talking Tom.
So when we share information with our partners, we keep your secret identity SECRET!
WHO MIGHT WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH?
Information is shared with our partners and they are not allowed to use your data for any other purpose than the purposes described
here
. If you want to find out more about our partners,
speak to your parent or legal guardian and then get in touch with us via our email address:
privacy@outfit7.com.
OTHER SITUATIONS WE MIGHT SHARE INFORMATION
If we start working with new partners. We’ll let you know when that happens by updating this Privacy Policy (a couple of times a year).
If we’re asked to do so in connection with a legal issue. That means someone from the law or government has asked us to do so. We all have to follow the rules.
If we need to follow through on our Terms and Conditions, or protect our operations, our users (like you!), or the user experience.
We may have to share information with another company, if a new company buys us, for example.
If you have any questions, ask your parent or guardian to contact us on:
privacy@outfit7.com
.
ADVERTISEMENTS
We want to share the fun of our games with as many people as possible. That’s why they’re free to play!
Part of how we’re able to do that is by showing
advertisements.
What are they?
Sometimes, when you’re playing a game, a pop-up or a banner labelled as an “AD” appears on the screen. This is an advertisement. Advertisements appear in different shapes and sizes.
Word of the day
“Advertisement”
An advertisement – also known as an “advert” or an “ad” for short – is a type of communication that positively shows you a product, service, or person.
INFORMATION FROM ADS
From ads, we get information that lets us know a few useful things:
Which ads you’ve seen
How long the ad is shown
How you interact with it (e.g. do you click on it?) - this is for our ads shown in other apps and the ads shown in our apps
Word of the day
“Advertisement”
An advertisement – also known as an “advert” or an “ad” for short – is a type of communication that positively shows you a product, service, or person.
SHARING AD INFORMATION WITH OUR PARTNERS
In order to show you ads, we share some information with our partners.
As we said before, sharing and collecting information helps us all do our jobs properly. Some partners might collect something called an advertising identifier. They’ll only use this to show you
contextual ads
and to check if the ad was shown to you and how you interacted with it. But don’t worry, they aren’t allowed to track you across the internet or build a picture of your habits.
Your secret identity (your name) stays safe!
WORD OF THE DAY
“Contextual Ads”
Ads that are shown to you based on the content you’re engaging with at that moment.
Example: When you play My Talking Tom, we will show you ads for similar games.
VIDEO ADS
To be able to play or show you videos in our apps we collect some information. This information does not identify you, it’s
anonymous.
WORD OF THE DAY
“Anonymous”
If you’re talking about a person:
Their name is not known.
If you’re talking about an object:
There’s nothing specific or personal about it.
GAME NOTIFICATIONS
Sometimes you might see little messages pop up on your device. These are called notifications, and they are sent directly from your device.
THE “TALKBACK” FEATURE
Did you know that you can talk to the Talking Tom & Friends characters in some of our games? They’ll even repeat back what you say in a funny voice!
Don’t worry, the game can’t record anything you say – we don’t have your voice recordings. Everything happens on your device.
This feature uses the microphone on your mobile phone or tablet, so we’ll always ask you if this is okay first. If it’s not, that’s fine! It will just mean that this feature doesn’t work.
REMEMBER!
Some of our games let you play in multiplayer mode and connect with other players. To help keep your identity secret, we will pick a name for you if needed.
IN-APP PURCHASES
Sometimes there are special things you can buy in our games. These are called
in-app purchases
.
When you buy something, it’s between you and the app store on your mobile phone or tablet. We’re not involved in taking the payment from you and we do not see your payment information.
It’s like when you go into a real store – you pay the shop, you don’t pay the toys and game makers
For more information, please read the In-App Purchases Section of the End User License Agreement, which is available here:
https://outfit7.com/eula/
.
This section only applies to you only if you are at or above the age of consent.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE AT OR ABOVE THE AGE OF CONSENT?
Your county has laws that deal with the protection of personal information. And these laws allow children who reach a certain age to make their own decisions about their personal information. If you have reached such an age, then this section applies to you.
This helps our partners understand how you interact with interest-based ads. They use this information to provide you with personalized ads in the future.
This allows our partners to provide their advertisers with more detailed information about who saw or interacted with their ads, and help build audiences for other advertisers.
INTEREST-BASED ADS
If you are above the age of consent set by the law that deals with the protection of personal information in your country, we may ask you if we can share your personal information with our partners, so they can show
interest-based ads to you
,
measure the performance of such ads
and
help us and them understand our audience
We will share your information for these reasons, only if you give your consent to do so.
Word of the day
“Interest-Based Ads”
These ads are not random – they’re shown to you based on your age, gender, behavior, interests you have, or things you like. They are also called “personalized ads” or “targeted ads”.
These ads can track you, or build a picture of you or your habits.
Example:
You play one of our games and give us permission to share your information. We share your advertising ID with one of our partners – and with it, they know that your device has clicked on a sports ad in a game before. So they will show you a sports ad in our game because they think you will like it.
WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED?
We will not share your email, name, or address with our partners. We will only share information that can personally identify your phone or tablet, such as advertising ID, IDFA, and IP address (we talked about these
here
). We may also share other information that may be personal to you, like your age or gender. Our advertising partners can use this information for interest-based ads.
WHO CAN SHOW INTEREST-BASED ADS TO ME?
You can check who can show interest-based ads to you and find out more about how such providers can use your information by
clicking here.
IMPORTANT
You can choose who you allow us to share your information with. We will ask for your consent in the game – and when we do, you have the option to choose the providers that you like and trust.
YOU HAVE A CHOICE
Before you give consent, make sure you understand what will happen with your personal information, including how and for what reasons it can be used. If you didn't understand this section, please DO NOT give your consent.
Instead please speak to your parent or legal guardian, and then you can get more detailed information together by clicking
here
or you can get in touch with us via our email address:
privacy@outfit7.com
Can I change my mind?
Yes!
You can change your mind at any time. Go to "Settings"  in the app and click on the "Interest-Based Ads" button.
A pop-up will open and show you a list of providers. You can then deselect some of the providers, or hit “Deselect All” to opt-out from interest-based ads.
REMEMBER
When you change your mind, or if you do not provide your consent, you may still see the same number of ads on your phone or tablet. The difference is that these ads may be less of interest to you because they won’t be based on things you like, your age, your gender, etc.  Our partners may also continue to show you ads based on the content of the game you’re playing.
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SEE AND DO?
Some of our games let you to interact or compete with other players. We will ask you to pick a name that other players will be able to see.
Please do not choose your real name.
You can always change your name by going to 'Settings' and selecting the 'Change Name' or 'Edit' button.
YOU HAVE RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
You have rights when it comes to your personal information (information about you) and
you can act on these rights.
We’re going to talk about some of these rights now.
YOUR RIGHTS
The right to object
The right of access
The right to correct personal information
The right to deletion
The right to complain
The right to restrict
The right to move your information (data portability)
The right to object
If you don’t like how we’re handling your information, you can delete our games to prevent any further collection of information. It’s as easy as that!
The right of access
You’re allowed to know what information we have about you, so you can ask us!
The right to correct personal information
If you think your information isn’t correct, let us know and we’ll fix it.
The right to deletion
If you don’t want us to have your information, you can ask us to delete it. It’s only fair - it’s your information! However, in order to check if it’s really you, we may need to ask you for some additional information. But we may need to keep some of your information because of legal rules. And we might also keep bits of anonymous data.
The right to complain
Are you unhappy with how your personal information has been handled? You can make your voice heard. You can speak to the authorities in the country where you live.
The right to restrict
Sometimes you can ask to put limits on how we use your information.
The right to move your information (data portability)
You can ask us to give back your information so you can give it to another company.
ACTING ON YOUR RIGHTS
To make one of these requests or to ask us a question about your rights,
speak to your parent or legal guardian and then get in touch with us via our email address:
privacy@outfit7.com.
There are a few things to remember about requests like these:
1) To be safe, we’ll need to make sure you are you. Why? Because privacy is important. And we don’t want to let someone else know your secret identity.
2) It could take about a month for us to deal with requests like those above. And, at the end of the process, if we can’t do what you asked, we will let you know why. Honesty is important.
EEA and UK RULES
Following the rules is important
You live in an area called the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”). That’s the area where the rules in this Privacy Policy apply.
We follow EEA and UK data protection legislation.
And we even have a special “Data Protection Officer” (ePrivacy GmbH, Große Bleichen 21, 20354 Hamburg) who helps us with this too.
By the way: When you play our games, we estimate the country where you are located, but you can always change your country via the app settings (by clicking and choosing the right place using the “Country” button) on your device. But you don’t have to.
The right to object
If you don’t like how we’re handling your information, you can delete our games to prevent any further collection of information. It’s as easy as that!
The right of access
You’re allowed to know what information we have about you, so you can ask us!
The right to correct personal information
If you think your information isn’t correct, let us know and we’ll fix it.
The right to deletion
If you don’t want us to have your information, you can ask us to delete it. It’s only fair - it’s your information! However, in order to check if it’s really you, we may need to ask you for some additional information. But we may need to keep some of your information because of legal rules. And we might also keep bits of anonymous data.
The right to complain
Are you unhappy with how your personal information has been handled? You can make your voice heard. You can speak to the authorities in the country where you live.
The right to restrict
Sometimes you can ask to put limits on how we use your information.
The right to move your information (data portability)
You can ask us to give back your information so you can give it to another company.
BEYOND THE EEA AND THE UK
To make and offer our games to you, we might need to share information with our partners – like we talked about.
Sometimes those partners will be far away – beyond the EEA or UK where you live. So those places would have different rules.
But even then, we have special measures in place to keep you and your personal information protected.
It might go to a country that has rules that are as strong as those in the EEA or the UK.
It might go to one of our partners outside the EEA or the UK, but we have a special contract in place – a set of rules – to protect your privacy. Or they might have a special certificate that says they respect the same rules as we do. You can find more information on our website:
https://outfit7.com/privacy/en.
LEGAL BASES
The law requires us to have an appropriate reason to collect your information.
These are the legal reasons we rely on. The names might sound confusing, but we’ll explain them!
Legitimate interests
Consent
Legal obligations
Legitimate interests
This is information that we use to give you the best experience playing our games. It helps us improve our games, to respond to you when you write to us, and to make sure that our games stay free-to-play (or at least low cost). We also use it to make sure that your information stays secure and that nothing we do gets in the way of your rights.
Consent
When we need something from you, like some particular information, we’ll ask you first. You can say no and ask us to stop and we will. If you want us to delete what we already have, you’ll need to ask for this separately.
Legal obligations
This is about information that we have to keep to make sure we obey the rules.
T.O.M.s
We’ve done our very best to make sure that your information is safe.
This means we’ve worked hard to put technical and organizational measures in place. We call these... T.O.M.s!
But even the best measures aren’t perfect.
HOLDING ONTO INFORMATION
We’ll hold onto the information we’ve collected for as long as you want to play our games.
If we keep it for a bit longer, don’t worry – it won’t be about
you
specifically. It’ll be
anonymous.
We’ll get rid of it as soon as we don’t need it. Or if you haven’t played one of our games for around five years.
But you can ask us to delete it sooner if you like!
Keep in mind that we may also have to store your information for a longer period if we have to do so in order to obey the law.
