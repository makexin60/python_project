Privacy Policy
I. INTRODUCTION Interior AI ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your data when you use the Interior AI software application (hereafter referred to as the "App").
When we refer to "personal data" or "personal information," we mean any information that can be used to identify an individual, directly or indirectly. This includes details such as your name, email address, or other identifying information.
This Privacy Policy applies to all users and other individuals who access or use the App ("Users").
A brief description of how Interior AI works: Interior AI uses advanced image processing and artificial intelligence techniques to enhance and modify photos uploaded by users. It offers various features to improve and stylize your photos but does not use your personal data to train separate AI models.
Please take a moment to review our Terms of Use to understand how our services are provided to you.

III. PHOTO DATA POLICY We take your privacy seriously when processing your photos. Most processing activities occur on your device.
AI Model Training:
At Interior AI, we use Modelslab Interior Design API to train the AI model using user photos. Modelslab stores photos used for training in their database for 30 days, after which they are deleted. Users can request immediate deletion of their photos. If you want your photos deleted immediately, please contact us at: help.interiorai@gmail.com.
AI-Generated Photos:
AI photos generated by the AI model are stored on your device, and all your photos are deleted when you delete the photo in the app or uninstall the app from your device.
