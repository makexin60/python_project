4. Legal grounds for Processing your information
4.1 Legal basis for processing:
We will use the information we collect about you in connection with the Services and for any such use, we rely on an appropriate legal ground. Where processing involves sensitive personal information, we also rely on an additional legal justification to use such information.
a.
Performance of the contract
Where we offer Services or enter into a contract with you to provide Services, we will collect and use your personal information where necessary to enable us to take steps to offer you the services, process your acceptance of the offer and fulfil our obligations in the contract with you.
b.
Legal and regulatory obligations
The collection and use of some aspects of your personal information is necessary to enable us to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. For example, Aon is licensed and regulated by certain industry regulators and is required to provide some Services in accordance with relevant regulatory rules, such as financial and prudential regulations, tax rules, obligations to prevent and detect unlawful activities, among others.
c.
Consent
You may also provide us with your consent to receive certain Services, marketing or communications from us (where legally required). In such situations, you are not obliged to provide your consent and you may choose to subsequently withdraw your consent at any stage once provided. However, where you refuse to provide information that we reasonably require to provide the Services, we may be unable to offer you the Services and/or we may terminate the Services if not possible to fulfil the Services without the respective information.
d.
Legitimate interests
The collection and use of some aspects of your personal information is necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate commercial interests.
For example, we have legitimate interests in:
providing professional Services across all Aon solution lines;
operating our business, and managing and developing our relationships with clients, suppliers and with you;
understanding and responding to inquiries;
receiving information from third parties and Aon affiliates to provide Services;
sharing data in connection with mergers and acquisitions and transfers of business;
preventing and detecting fraud;
improving our Services; and
understanding how you and our clients use our Services and websites.
Where we rely on this legal basis to collect and use your personal information, we shall take appropriate steps to ensure the processing does not infringe the rights and freedoms conferred to you under the applicable data privacy laws.
Additional legal conditions for processing sensitive information and data relating to criminal records and offences.
e.
Explicit Consent
We rely on your explicit consent to collect and use personal information concerning any criminal convictions or alleged offences, specifically for the purpose of assessing risks relating to your prospective or existing insurance policy. We may also share this information with other insurance market participants and third parties where necessary to offer, administer and manage the Services provided to you, such as insurers and insurance underwriters, reinsurers, brokers and vetting agencies. Where we rely on your consent to collect and use your personal information, you are not obliged to provide your consent and you may choose to subsequently withdraw your consent at any stage once provided. However, where you refuse to provide information that we reasonably require to provide the Services, we may be unable to offer you the Services and/or we may terminate the Services if not possible to fulfil the Services without the respective information. Where you choose to receive the Services from us you agree to the collection and use of your personal information in the way we describe in this Section of this Statement. You also agree that such information may be collected and used for the above purpose by the insurance underwriter named in your insurance policy documentation. You should refer to the insurer’s privacy notice on their website for further information about their privacy practices.
f.
Substantial public interest or exemption regulations pursuant to local laws.
If applicable laws allow, we may collect and use your personal information for a substantial public interest or specific exemptions provided under such laws. For example, for insurance purposes or for determining benefits under an occupational pension scheme. The collection and use of some aspects of your personal information, such as information concerning your health, is necessary for insurance and/or occupational pension scheme purposes.
We may also use your personal information, including information relating to criminal convictions or alleged offences to prevent and detect unlawful acts, fraud, other financial crime, and crime generally in the insurance and financial services industry.
g.
The establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
We may also need to process some sensitive personal information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims by us or third parties.

6. Recipients of your information

You should refer to the insurer’s privacy notice on their website for further information about their privacy practices;

7. Overseas transfers of your information
7.1
We operate on a global and worldwide basis, and we may therefore transfer personal information about you to other countries to be processed for the purposes outlined in this Statement. In particular, we may make such transfers to offer, administer and manage the Services provided to you and improve the efficiency of our business operations. We endeavour to ensure that such transfers comply with all applicable data privacy laws and provide appropriate protection for the rights and freedoms conferred to individuals under such laws.
7.2
Where we collect personal information about you in the UK or the European Economic Area (the “
EEA
”) we may transfer the information to countries outside the UK or EEA for the processing purposes outlined in this Statement. This may include transfers to Aon group entities or third parties in countries that the European Commission (the “
EC
”) and UK data protection regulator consider to provide adequate data privacy safeguards and to some countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision (which includes participants under the EU Data Privacy Framework, or the UK Extension to the Data Privacy Framework, also known as the UK-US Data Bridge). Where we transfer personal information to countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision we shall put in place appropriate safeguards, approved by the European Commission or UK data protection regulator. Transfers within Aon group are covered by an intra-group data transfer agreement which contains the European standard contractual clauses to ensure that personal information about you receives an appropriate and consistent level of protection across the Aon group entities. Transfers to third parties will be subject to contractual commitments that provide for an adequate level of protection for your personal information.
7.3
We may make disclosures where we receive a request from a foreign regulatory body. We will make such disclosures where an adequate level of protection is in place, or an exemption applies. In any event, such requests will be carefully validated before personal information is disclosed. Where necessary, we may implement additional technical, organizational or contractual measures to ensure an adequate level of protection for your personal information. You can obtain further information concerning these safeguards by contacting us.
8. Retention of your information
We retain appropriate records of your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes listed in Section 3, to operate our business and comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. These records are retained for predefined retention periods that may extend beyond the period for which we provide the Services to you. In most cases we shall retain your personal information for no longer than is required under the applicable laws. For example, we retain certain details of your contract until the time limit for claims arising from the Service has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding how long such information is retained. In some cases, we may retain personal information if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation.
Where personal information is no longer needed for the purposes listed in Section 3 above, we may de-identify the information to use it for statistical purposes, or to perform business analytics or product and service development. We may retain anonymised information indefinitely. We have implemented appropriate measures to ensure your personal information is securely destroyed in a timely and consistent manner when no longer required. If you would like to know more about how long your personal information is retained, please contact us.
9. Information Security
The security of your personal information is important to us, and we have implemented appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the personal information we collect about you and ensure that such information is processed in accordance with applicable data privacy laws.
10. Your Information Rights
10.1
You have the following rights under applicable data privacy laws in respect of any personal information we collect and use about you:
a.
Right to access:
a right to access and inspect your personal information or be provided with a permanent copy of the information being held about you.
b.
Right to correction:
a right to request the correction of your personal information or in cases where the accuracy of information is disputed, to supplement the information to give notice that you dispute its accuracy.
c.
Right to erasure:
a right to request the erasure of your personal information, particularly where the continued use of the information is no longer necessary.
d.
Right to object to processing:
a right to object to the use of your personal information, particularly where you feel there are no longer sufficient legitimate grounds for us to continue processing the information.
e.
Right to object to direct marketing:
a right to object to the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. See Section 11 below for further information.
f.
Right to restrict processing:
a right to request the restriction of your personal information from further use, e.g. where the accuracy of the information is disputed, and you request that the information not be used until its accuracy is confirmed.
g.
Right to portability:
The right to request that some aspects of your personal information be provided to you or a third party of your choice in electronic form to enable its reuse.
h.
Right to object to automated decision making:
a right to object to decisions involving the use of your personal information, which have been taken solely by automated means. See Section 12 below for further information.
i.
Right to withdraw consent:
where the processing of your personal information is based on consent, you can withdraw your consent at anytime. Where you exercise this right, it will not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out prior to the withdrawal of consent.
j.
Right to obtain a copy of, or reference to the safeguards we implement to transfer your personal information outside the EEA or the UK:
where you exercise this right, we may redact some commercially sensitive information within such documents.
k.
Right to lodge a complaint with a regulator:
a right to complain to the relevant data protection regulator about our processing of your personal information. See Section 13 below for further information.
10.2
It is important to note, however, that some of the rights described above in Section 10.1 can only be exercised in certain circumstances or countries. If we are unable to fulfil a request from you to exercise one of your rights under applicable data privacy laws, we will write to you to explain the reason for refusal. Where required, further information concerning these rights and their application can be obtained by contacting us using the contact details set out in Section 14 below.
11. Direct Marketing
We will use your personal information to send you direct marketing about other products and services that we feel may be of interest to you, in the form of letter, email, SMS, telephone or online advertisements. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your informed consent prior to sending you direct marketing. We will give you the opportunity to refuse direct marketing at the point that you apply or register to receive the services and, on each occasion, thereafter that you receive direct marketing communications from us. You can also change your marketing preferences at any stage by contacting us. Please note that, even if you opt out of receiving direct marketing communications, we may still send you service-related communications where necessary.
12. Automated Decisions, Profiling and use of Artificial Intelligence
Where you apply or register to receive a Service, we may carry out a real-time automated assessment to determine whether you are eligible to receive the Service and to calculate your premiums. An automated assessment is an assessment carried out automatically using technological means (e.g., computer systems) without human involvement. In some cases these decisions may involve evaluating behaviour or making predictions about you which are relevant to the Service (“Profiling”).
This assessment requires that we compile and analyse personal information from the various sources set out in Section 2 and comprises several checks, e.g., credit history and bankruptcy check, validation of your driving licence and motoring convictions, validation of your previous claims history and other fraud prevention checks. Your personal information (including sensitive personal information) may therefore be matched against models and also used to create models to determine Service eligibility and premiums. Where your application to receive the Service does not appear to meet the eligible criteria, it may be automatically refused, and you will receive notification of this during the application process. However, where a decision is taken solely by automated means involving the use of your personal information, you have the right to challenge the decision and ask us to reconsider the matter, with human intervention. If you wish to exercise this right, you should contact us.
13. Complaints
If you wish to make a complaint about the way we use your personal information you should raise this with us by contacting us using the contact details set out in Section 14 below.
However, if you are not satisfied with the way we have handled your complaint you have the right to raise the matter with the relevant data protection regulator in your country.

They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

Please note that we may from time to time modify or update our functional cookies. When that happens, we will update our list accordingly.

Targeting and Advertising Cookies
These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.

Please note that we may from time to time modify or update our targeting cookies. When that happens, we will update our list accordingly.
