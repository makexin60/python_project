5. Where we store your personal information
It is possible that some of the information about you that we hold may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, one of our suppliers or someone else. For instance, if it is necessary to do so to complete a transaction, your personal information (e.g. name and account details) may be sent to a third party or one of our contracted supplies outside the EEA. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy statement. You thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage or processing of that information in the EEA and you understand that your information may be available to government authorities under lawful orders and laws as applicable. We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will comply with applicable laws that govern the transfer of personal information in transactions and provide with appropriate notification and choice, as required by law. As a result, please be aware that in such event and to the extent permitted by law we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged. Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.  Nevertheless, to the extent permitted by law, we may not be able to promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.

Any payment transactions undertaken through CU Online are encrypted using SSL technology. You must keep your PIN, Password and Username for CU Online, and any other security device we give you, safe and secure. You should log off CU Online and your Online Account when finished using CU Online. The use of the Internet, by its nature, is not always secure.

You are responsible for providing all you require to safely and properly access and use CU Online and the Online Services including a computer, an Internet connection and security software.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Waterford Credit Union is concerned about children’s privacy. The websites that we operate provide a forum for all of our members, including children, to view our products and what is happening in our Credit Union world. While we encourage children to participate appropriately in our websites, their privacy is extremely important to us. This Children’s Privacy Statement explains our information practices in connection with information provided by children under the age of 18 on websites that link to this Children’s Privacy Statement. The websites are controlled and operated by us from Ireland and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the Republic Of Ireland. Our goal is to minimise the information gathered from and disseminated about children under 18 while permitting them active participation in the trustworthy information, education and independent voice for which Waterford Credit Union is known.
A. How We Collect and Use Information from Children
Children can explore the websites, and can view and print reviews, comments and other content without providing any personal information. We do not permit children under 16 years of age to become an on-line banking user. We may use information collected from children during the exploration of our Sites in the following manner:
To confirm the child’s account
To determine the child’s current age in order to respond to any queries in an appropriate manner.
Children may post comments on our websites provided they are eligible users of said websites. We moderate all postings including children’s postings to remove personal information, and
we encourage parents to discuss with their children why they should NEVER include personal information in comments posted to the websites
. Children may also participate in other online activities, such as polls. All members, including children, have the ability to delete their postings to the websites. Or the member can send an email requesting deletion to info@waterfordcu.ie, noting their name and date of the comment. It is possible that deleted reviews or comments will remain in our system (such as in backups of our data), but they will not be visible through the Sites. Please note that your request or deletion does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been re-posted by another user. When children interact with the websites, certain technical information may automatically be collected, both to make our websites more interesting and useful and for various internal purposes related to our business. Examples of information that is automatically collected include: the type of computer operating system, the device’s IP address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our websites, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers (which we define under the “Use of Cookies” section of our general Privacy Policy). This information may be collected by us or by a third party. Persistent identifier information is used by Waterford Credit Union for the sole purpose of providing support for our internal operations, including in order to:
Ensure that the websites function properly
Enable us to conduct research and analysis to understand, address and improve the use and performance of the websites, and
Diagnose and respond to problems
We may work with third parties to perform site analytics and provide services to keep your user experience on the Site free of spam.
B. What Information About Children Is Shared?
We do not disclose to third parties any children’s personal information that we collect other than as follows, consistent with applicable law: (a) with a parent’s permission, (b) as required by any applicable law, (c) to third-party service providers who help us operate or manage the Sites, (d) as part of aggregated data shared with third-party service providers, (e) to comply with legal process, (f) to respond to governmental requests, (g) to enforce our Terms of Service, (h) to protect our operations, (i) for assistance in fraud detection and prevention; (j) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Waterford Credit Union, your child or others, (k) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain, and (l) in connection with a disposition of all or a substantial portion of our business, assets or stock, such as a sale, merger, consolidation, reorganisation, joint venture, assignment, or bankruptcy or similar proceedings.
C. How May Parents Access, Change or Delete Information About Their Child?
Parents may at any time access or change the personal information that we have collected online from their children. Parents may also ask us to cease further collection of personal information from their children, or to make no further use of, or delete, the personal information we have collected online from their children, in which case, the child’s account will be deleted. Parents may contact us at info@waterfordcu.ie. For your child’s protection, we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
D. How May Parents Raise Other Questions or Concerns?
If a parent has any questions or concerns about his or her child’s use of the Sites, we encourage the parent to contact us at info@waterfordcu.ie
