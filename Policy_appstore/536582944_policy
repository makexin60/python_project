What information do you collect on me?
We collect information about the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of all visitors to the site which helps us monitor the level of activity and the service we provide. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify your computer.
Computing devices require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop, and to make sure messages get from one device to another and that the messages are understood.
Back to top
What about if I fill in a web form?
To provide you with services, such as qualifications or professional membership, or answering an online query, we need to obtain and use your data.  We provide specific information and Privacy Notices for each of our services at the time you submit your information, so you always know what’s going to happen to your information, also ensuring you are in control of how it is used.
In addition to specific Privacy Notices about a particular service, we also maintain a more general
Data protection notice
that covers a wider view of our activities for people that want further details.  We also have the
ACCA Privacy Promise
, which spells out our overall commitment to privacy.

If you get in touch with us using ACCA Connect or the Webchat facility on our website, or otherwise using the contact details or social media referred to on our website, we may collect and retain your contact details and the contents of your communication in order to handle your query and maintain records for training and development purposes.
Calls made to ACCA's customer call centre and other communications may also be recorded and retained for training and record-keeping purposes.
We may also retain records of interactions with you using social media sites including
Facebook
,
ACCA on LinkedIn
and
ACCA on Twitter
with tools that analyse your interactions with us.
Back to top
What about other websites you provide links to on your site?
While we take all reasonable precautions to make sure that other organisations who we deal with have good security practices, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other organisations whose websites may be linked to our service, or whose contact details we may provide on our website (such as joint scheme partners).
We are also not responsible for the privacy practices of social media providers with whom ACCA has pages or accounts.

Appendix to ACCA's data protection notice ACCA affiliated entities
Why a general privacy notice?
When the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and its affiliated entities (together 'ACCA', 'us' or 'we') collects your information, we are required by law to be fair in notifying individuals on how their information will be managed and to inform them of their rights. But more than that, we want to be transparent, open and ethical in our practices.
This data protection notice provides information on how we use personal data relating to our prospective and existing customers, our partners and other individuals we do business with (also referred to in this notice as 'you'), including:
ACCA members, affiliates, registered students and potential students
subscribers to ACCA magazines and other publications
representatives from employers of students and members
representatives of partner organisations and service providers
registrants for continuing professional development training courses or other events
donors and lenders as part of our benevolent fund
complainants and enquirers
continuous learners
A list of ACCA affiliated entities relevant to this notice and their activities is set out in the
appendix to this notice
.
We have a separate Privacy Notice for our staff, employees and those wishing to become our employees, which can be accessed at the time of applying to ACCA.
Back to top
I’ve been redirected here from another privacy notice. Why?
We try and give you all the information you need at the point of collection, in tailored privacy notices specific to the product or service you want to take up.
However, it is sometimes impossible to give you all the information in a small space, or to tell you everything in as much detail as you may want.  In that case we redirect you to this longer notice, which outlines a more general approach to privacy (but will not hold specifics for the product or service), which you may read at your leisure.
Back to top
This is a bit much. Can you shorten it?
We try to use plain language throughout the next sections, but there is a lot of detail to communicate, which is however important for you to understand.
If you want a more principle based approach to our general intention surrounding privacy, you should
read our privacy promise
and you can always navigate directly to the part or question of your interest directly.
Back to top
Why does ACCA hold information on me?
We will only process personal data where we have a lawful basis to do so.
The basis for processing your personal data will vary depending on the activity we collected it for. In some occurrences, we may have more than one lawful basis for processing.
The information below summarises the basis on which we process personal information.
A summary of the legal basis used by ACCA are:
Public interest:
ACCA as a regulatory body processes personal data to protect members of the public and in the public interest. This includes, but not limited to, the maintenance of the Members Directory, Regulatory Activities, and Member Investigations and Disciplinary Actions.
Contract:
ACCA processes personal data which is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you may be a party to, or may want to enter. This includes, but not limited to, ACCA membership, examinations, career services and subscriptions.
Legal obligation:
ACCA processes personal data which is necessary to comply with its legal obligations. This includes, but not limited to, providing personal information to regulators, law enforcement agencies and statutory bodies.
Legitimate interest:
ACCA processes personal data in order to meet its legitimate interests as a professional association and regulator of Chartered Accountants. This includes, but is not limited to responding to general enquiries, supporting our students, members and partners, and improving our services relating to their Continued Professional Development, training and employment.
Vital Interest:
Where ACCA has a reasonable belief that an individual is at immediate risk of harm or threat to life, it may share your personal details with the emergency authority services. This legal basis will only be used in emergency medical situations.
Consent:
ACCA processes personal data where you have provided your consent to do so. ACCA only uses your express consent in certain circumstances (such as marketing communications). You may freely withdraw your consent for these purposes at any time with no impact to our service to you.
Administration of studentship and membership records
We will collect and hold personal data relating to members, affiliates and registered students in order to administer membership or studentship with ACCA and comply with our regulatory obligations. We will use this information to provide and manage your access to our student, affiliate, and member portals (myACCA).
In certain cases, it is also voluntary for members, affiliates and registered students to provide us with details of ethnic origin, in order for us to review equality or opportunity of treatment.
Training and examinations
We will use your information to administer courses and exams and to monitor the pass rates and performance of learning providers, as well as ACCA students. We may use sensitive information to determine your eligibility for special accommodations in order to provide you with assistance as part of the examinations and to comply with various equality and disability legislations. Please note that some examinations may be taken electronically and therefore may require the collection of additional information for the purpose of electronic processing.
ACCA works with third-party service providers to deliver online exam delivery solutions which feature remote invigilation whilst ensuring the security and integrity of our exams. As part of this exam delivery method, the capture of audio, video and biometric information may be necessary to allow third-party service providers to administer the exams, verify student identity, and remote invigilators to monitor students during the exam session.
This information will be used solely for the purpose of exam delivery and any subsequent ACCA disciplinary processes relevant to the exam. More details with regards to the data captured during exams featuring remote invigilation will be presented to students in the supporting pre-exam documentation.
Statistical Analysis
We will use your information to carry out statistical analysis and research that will be performed to provide personalised learning support and tailored interventions which will improve our services and products to you so that we may continue to provide you with the best outcomes on your ACCA journey.
We are committed to maintaining high standards of confidentiality and have robust internal policies, processes, and training in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws. Additionally, we will adhere to industry standard methods that ensure all relevant technical and organisational safeguards are applied to any processing.
ACCA will rely on Legitimate Interests in order to undertake this processing activity.
Practice tests
ACCA self-study students and students studying with our Approved Learning Partners (ALPs) and tutors can undertake practice test papers, using our online resources. Practice test results will be retained by our service provider. These practice test results can be accessed by students, and our ALPs and tutors in order to assist their studies. We may use information from these practice test results to identify areas of improvement within our syllabus and exams. Practice exam results will not be shared with any other third parties.
ACCA Exchange
This is a service offered to employers and learning providers. It enables them to upload details of the ACCA students, affiliates and members whom they employ and/or are training and monitor examination status exam results, PER and CPD. ACCA requires such employers and learning providers to obtain your consent before including your details on this service.
ACCA Learning Community
We will use your personal data to validate your registration to ACCA’s learning community services.
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and other courses
ACCA offers CPD training courses and other training events, online or offline, for both members and non-members and we will need your information, in order to administer such courses. We will use your information to establish and validate your work experience as part of your progression to membership.
ACCA Connect
We will use your information to respond to enquiries and assist you with your request. Your communications with ACCA, including online, by email, text message (SMS), via ACCA's customer contact centre (or otherwise) may be recorded and retained for training and record-keeping purposes. Records may be used to monitor the quality of the assistance given and to verify the matters discussed.
If you post or interact with us via social media, we may use your information, in order to contact you in relation to the query, we will not use this for the purpose of further marketing or communications, unless you give us your consent to do so. We may share information with our third-party service delivery partners in order to assist you.
Communications (including marketing)
ACCA will contact you in through service messages relating to your account management. A service message is an important notification that is sent to you for administrative purposes and that may have a detrimental impact to your account should you fail to receive or act upon it, such as information about student exam dates, member subscription deadlines and any other information fundamental to your relationship with ACCA. ACCA may utilise certain platforms connected with the information you have already provided us with, to send you general service messaging.
We may also use your information for marketing purposes and to send you relevant communications about our qualifications, our products and services and any other relevant events.  We may use your contact details to send you registration or information packs, learning support and recruitment materials, surveys, questionnaires, invitations regarding ACCA-based consultations, details of ACCA courses and events or to notify you of any updates and changes to ACCA's products and services. You will have the right to always withdraw your consent for these for marketing messages and we will make this process as easy as possible.
ACCA uses email management tools to manage our email communications and newsletters. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies including clear gifs to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter and campaigns to ensure they remain relevant to you.
ACCA may also carry out mailings on behalf of third parties (without disclosing your details to such third parties), subject to obtaining your consent. Consent may be requested on your ACCA registration form or separately by ACCA. Please let us know if you do not wish to receive (or wish to change the way in which you receive) any of the above materials (see “

We will always inform you when participating in public campaigns and will seek your explicit agreement prior to using your information. Examples of these are ambassador and leadership campaign programmes or interviews undertaken during public events.
Professional conduct
We will use your information for the purpose of enquiries, investigations and complaints relating to members, affiliates and registered students (or prospective and former students) and may disclose your personal data to third parties in order to investigate complaints and disciplinary matters.

How will ACCA collect the information?
We will collect data directly from you (for example from registration forms, change of details forms, at fairs and events and via our website) and will create some data internally (e.g. when we assign you an ACCA ID or determine examination results).
Where we collect information, whether that be via websites, telephone, or manual forms we will provide at the point of collection a more tailored and specific privacy notice pointing out the relevant information for that product or service and justifying why the collection is necessary.
We may also collect some data from external sources. For example:
Employers and learning providers may provide ACCA with relevant information on members and students employed by and/or training with them, including where they are registering you for a course
ACCA's service providers (e.g. examiners and invigilators) will send ACCA information relevant to the service they are providing
The general public may provide information to ACCA in relation to complaints and/or investigations.
Back to top
Where will my data be stored?
ACCA's main information systems are located within the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Economic Area (EEA) and accessed by ACCA's customer services teams, which may be located in regional hub centres.
We process information within the UK & EEA, but may also transfer data outside of UK & EEA to our suppliers as part of our operations and service delivery. Other teams within ACCA may need to access, use and store your data in certain circumstances for the purposes listed above, e.g. to communicate with you in relation to training or examinations or to investigate incidents or complaints.
If you are an overseas member or student, your information may be accessed by ACCA's national office in your country and records may be maintained locally (subject to local legislation).
Some of our partners or service providers, or technology vendors may pass information outside of the UK & EEA into jurisdictions where privacy laws, obligations and rights may vary.  For such transfers, we will always ensure that appropriate safeguards and measures are put in place to protect your privacy and we will also point this out to you in specific privacy notices for that product or service, if applicable.

How do I keep my information up to date and accurate?
Please note that it is your responsibility to inform us of any change to your contact details during your studentship or membership with ACCA and to keep us informed of which courses you have attended to satisfy ongoing CPD requirements.  We endeavour to provide self-service where possible, so you can review and update your own information at your leisure via
myACCA

Service providers
ACCA uses a number of third-party service providers in order to carry out the activities described above, for example, to send you mailings or operate or administer exams, including exam solutions delivered with remote invigilation. ACCA requires such service providers to use your personal data only for the purpose of the relevant service.
Joint scheme partners & other professional bodies
In some countries, ACCA operates
joint qualification schemes
with national professional accountancy bodies. Under these partnerships, students register with both ACCA and the national partner and are thereby able to satisfy the exam criteria for membership of both simultaneously. ACCA and the joint scheme professional bodies need to share information with each other to operate the scheme. This information will include, but is not limited to, information on exam results, subscription payments and contact details. In certain circumstances, ACCA may also rely on legitimate interest as the legal basis when introducing a new joint scheme.
Event sponsors
ACCA may organise events, such as webinars, CPD sessions, conferences and career fairs which may be sponsored by other organisations or partners, and in order to administrate these events we may share your personal information with these sponsors.

In addition, disciplinary hearings and outcomes may be made public.
Verification of details and employment assistance
