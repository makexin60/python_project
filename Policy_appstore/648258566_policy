by which you may be personally identified, such as your name, e-mail address, biographical information,
professional title and history, social media accounts, images and photographs, financial information,

We collect this information:
directly from you when you provide it to us, such as during the registration process or in your user profile;
automatically, as you navigate through or use the Services, through the use of cookies, browser detection
and other tracking technologies; and
from third party services with which you have linked your account, such as Facebook.
Most of the content and features related to the Services require you to register for an account in order
for us to provide you with access and a personalized experience. During our account registration process,
we will collect from you your email address, your first and last name, and a password.
You must provide all of this information in order to obtain an account.
After completing our registration form, you will receive a welcome email describing your new account
and how to access that account. You may, at your option, also store additional information in your user profile,
such as your photograph, social media credentials, biographical information,
location, language preferences, political and/or religious beliefs, opinions, sexual orientation
and other personal details, as part of your account with our Services.
Please be aware that the information contained in your user profile may be available to
other users of the Services and other third parties.
If you choose to use the Services via a paid account, Podomatic will also collect the following information
from you: your full billing address, credit card number, credit card expiration date, and zip code.
Podomatic will keep this information on file in our secure server in order to process recurring invoices.

credit card authenticity and process payments as per your applicable credit card service agreement.
Upon discontinuation of the Services, your credit card information will be deleted from our billing system.
If we are unable to process your subscription for a given month, this information, along with your account
information, may be used to contact you.
Podomatic uses third party payment processors to assist it in processing your payments securely.
Podomatic provides the information described under “Paid Account Subscriptions” to those processors.
Their use of such information is governed by their respective privacy policies,
which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.
Payments are currently processed and managed using the third party vendors listed below. We will inform

When accessing web pages on the Websites or resources through the Services, Podomatic may use
automatic collection methods to obtain certain information about your sessions, devices, browsing actions
and patterns, including your IP address, access URL, time of access, geographic location,
browser type and referral URL.
This information is collected in order to administer the Services and provide you with a personalized experience.
We also collect this information in order to track users’ movements within the Services,
to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole and to provide us with internal information
regarding site traffic, trends and usage statistics. This information may also be used to identify
users who are using the Service for spam or other activity that is deemed in conflict with our Terms of Service.
Otherwise, this information is used in the aggregate, and is never linked back to any
personally identifiable information.
The methods that we use to automatically collect data consist of: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.
For example, we use cookies (a small data file placed on the hard drive of your device) for authentication purposes,
for tracking user sessions, preferences and movements around the Services, for anonymous and aggregated marketing
analytics, performance analytics, retargeting and for tracking aggregate trends. Users can control the
use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Services,
but your ability to use some features or access certain areas of the Services may be limited.
Please note that we do not respond to “do not track” requests.
Some content or applications, including advertisements, available on or through the Services are served
by third parties, including our partners, affiliates, service providers and application providers.
These third parties may use cookies, alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies,
to collect information about you when you access or use the Services. The information they collect
may be associated with your personally identifiable information or they may collect information,
including personally identifiable information, about your online activities over time
and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information
to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.
If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content,
you should contact the responsible provider directly.
Your use of the Services includes the ability to create, display, transmit or otherwise “post” content
to make available to other users of the Services and to other third parties (collectively, “User Contributions”).
If you post any User Contributions through the Services, including any comments on other users’
User Contributions, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to provide
may be read, collected or used by other users of the Services, as well as other third parties,
and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Your User Contributions are posted and transmitted to others
at your own risk. We are not responsible for the information you choose to post, and we will not control or
limit the use of that information by others.  YOU POST INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK.
The Services also provide the opportunity for you to link to, interact with and post content,
including User Contributions, through various social media and third party sites.
For example, the Services may include social media features such as the Facebook button, widgets such as the
“Share this” button and other interactive mini-programs that run on the Services (collectively, the “Features”).
These Features may collect your IP address, which page or resource you are visiting on the Website
or otherwise in connection with the Services and may set a cookie to enable the Features to function properly.
The Features may be hosted either by a third party or hosted directly through the Services.
Your interactions with such third party sites, including the Features, and any information you provide
in connection with those interactions, may be publicly viewable outside of the Services.
Each social media and third party site and service has its own privacy policies and practices
that may be more or less protective than this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the policies
and practices of such sites and services, then you should not access or use them.
We are not responsible for information you choose to post in connection with such sites or services.
Uses of Information
Podomatic collects the aforem entioned information in order to provide you with the Services,
which allow you to create, browse, search and listen to podcasts. Various features within the Services will,
at your discretion, display your name, or adjust the date and time of events based on your locale.
We also use the information that we collect about you or that you provide to us,
including any personally identifiable information:
to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us;
to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it;
to provide you with notices about your account;
to provide you with customer service;
to make announcements related to the Services, or any products or services we offer or provide though them;
to allow you to participate in interactive features on the Services (including newsletters and promotions);
in any other ways we may describe when you provide the information; and
for any other purpose with your consent.
Information collected through automatic collection methods is used only to identify potential cases
of abuse and establish statistical information regarding traffic and usage.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We may disclose aggregated information about our visitors and registered users without restriction.
This information contains statistics related to traffic and the geographic location of our visitors and users.
However, it does not identify individual visitors or users.  We may share aggregated demographic information
about our users with our marketing partners. We may also share aggregated user information with third parties
who help us to analyze such information in order to improve the Services.
Other than as described herein, we do not link aggregated data with personally identifiable information.
We may disclose personally identifiable information that we collect or that you provide:
to the general public or other users of the Services, if such information is contained within
your user profile or otherwise made available by you in connection with your use of the Services;
to our personnel, contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to
support the Services and our business;
to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it;
to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization,
dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern
or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personally identifiable information
held by us about the Websites’ visitors or the users of the Services is among the assets transferred; and
for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
We may also disclose your personally identifiable information:
to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request;
to enforce or apply our Terms of Service, including acceptable use policies
(see
https://www.podomatic.com/about/tos
);
or
if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Podomatic, our users or others.
Podomatic uses third party service providers to perform functions on its behalf. Examples include credit card processing,
email service providers, analyzing data and providing customer service. These service providers may receive access to
personally identifiable information needed to perform such functions on our behalf and are only authorized to use your
personally identifiable information as necessary to provide these services to us.
In connection with the Services, we may also partner with third parties to give you the ability to make your
User Contributions available on their audio podcast platforms (e.g., Pandora, Google Podcasts, Spotify,
Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, Audible, Deezer, etc.). By choosing to make your User Contributions available on
such third party platforms, you consent to Podomatic’s disclosure and sharing of your User Contributions and
any other information required to such third-parties on your behalf, including your personally
identifiable information. Such third parties’ use of your personally identifiable information
is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections
as protective as this Privacy Policy.
We also use YouTube API Services to give You the ability to upload your Content to YouTube. By choosing to upload Your Content on YouTube, You consent to Podomatic’s disclosure and sharing of your User Contributions and any other information required to YouTube on your behalf, including your personally identifiable information.  YouTube and Google's use of your personally identifiable information is governed by the Google Privacy Policy at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy
To delete your Data from YouTube, You can revoke the access to Your Data via the access to their data via the Google security settings page at https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions
Information Security
We store all user information in secure databases protected by a variety of industry-standard access controls.
For example, we use secure passwords, SSL encryption, disk-based encryption, firewalls, and other measures to
help us protect your information. However, no company, including Podomatic, can fully eliminate security risks
associated with the transmission of personally identifiable information through online transactions, and you
do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures
contained on or within the Services.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have
chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping that password
confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Accessing Your Personally Identifiable Information
All information that Podomatic stores related to your account, including subscription billing information,
is accessible through your account. You may use access to your account to correct, update or delete your
information at any time, and we encourage you to keep this information current so that your customer service
requests and billing processes operate efficiently. You may also make changes by contacting us at
legal@podomatic.com
. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe
the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
To remove all of your personally identifiable information from our system, you must submit your account
for deactivation and submit a request to be forgotten. To do so, you must first navigate to the Settings
menu in your account and click on “Delete Account;” then you must email us at
legal@podomatic.com
to request that we delete any additional information about you that we
may have obtained and stored. Once we receive such request, we will delete your personally identifiable
information from our servers, although if you used a login name instead of an email address,
your login name will remain on our system indefinitely. If you wish to only remove your billing subscription
information, you must terminate your paid account. If you registered through Paypal,
you must cancel your subscription via Paypal. Please be aware that copies of your personally identifiable
information or your User Contributions may have been copied or stored by other users or third parties.
Proper access and use of information provided through the Services is governed by
our Terms of Service
https://www.podomatic.com/about/tos
.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Services to you.
After such time, we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
Your Rights and Choices Regarding Our Use and Disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information
You may decline to provide personally identifiable information when it is requested by Podomatic,
but if you decline, certain parts of the Services, or all of the Services, may be unavailable to you.
If you no longer wish to receive marketing-related emails from us, you may opt-out via the unsubscribe
link included in such emails. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
Please note that if you opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from Podomatic, we may still send
you important administrative messages that are required to provide you with the Services.
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising
on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information
about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon
your browsing activities and interests. If you do not wish to allow the use of cookies, you can
set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
If you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of the Services may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising.
However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected
or used in this way. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you
interest-based ads, you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from members of the
Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) on the NAI’s website by clicking
here
(for a similar option if located in the European Union,

Please note this does not opt you out of being served other ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information.
This Section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
You have the right to request that we disclose to you certain information about our collection and use of your
personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request
(discussed
below
),
we will disclose to you:
the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
the categories of sources for the personal information we have collected about you;
our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information;
the categories of third parties with whom we sell or share that personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you (also called a data portability request); and
if we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
(i) sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
(ii) disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories
that each category of recipient obtained.
You also have the right to request that Podomatic delete any of your personal information that we have collected
from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request
(discussed
below
),
we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal
information from our records, unless an exception applies.
Podomatic may deny your request to delete your personal information if it is necessary for us or our service
providers to maintain your personal information in order to:
complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good
or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing
business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between the Podomatic and you;
detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity;
or prosecute those responsible for that activity;
debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech,
or exercise another right provided for by law;
comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter
3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code;
engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest
that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of the information
is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research,
if the consumer has provided informed consent;
enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with Podomatic;
to comply with a legal obligation; or
otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible
with the context in which you provided the information.
To exercise the access, data portability and deletion rights described above,
please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
logging into your user account and submitting a request.
calling us at 415-975-9981.
emailing us at
legal@podomatic.com
with the subject line heading of “CCPA Consumer Privacy Request.”
sending us a request by regular mail to:
Podomatic, Inc.
Attn: Legal Department
185 Clara Street, Suite 101C
San Francisco, CA 94107
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
related to your personal information. To designate an authorized agent, please provide such
authorized individual with signed permission to do so. An agent’s failure to provide evidence
of authorization may result in our denial of the request.
You may only make a verifiable request for access to your personal information twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we have
collected personal information or an authorized agent, which may include providing the email address
we have on file for you, and referencing a non-public detail that is included in your user profile
that we may use to verify your identity;
and
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity
or the authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However,
we do consider requests made through your password-protected account sufficiently verified when the
request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify
the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Once we receive a verifiable consumer
request from you, we will confirm receipt within 10 days and we endeavor to respond to you within 45 days
of receiving the verifiable consumer request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason
and extension period in writing.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of the verifiable
consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request,
if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information
that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to
another entity without hindrance.
We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you
why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
We do not sell your personal information. However, we want to make sure that you are aware of all of your
consumer rights under the CCPA, which includes the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
Under the CCPA, if you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct a business, at any time,
not to sell your personal information (the “right to opt-out”). If you are under the age of 16, you
(or your parent or guardian if you are 13 years or younger) are required to provide affirmative
authorization (the “right to opt-in”) to the sale of your personal information. Consumers
who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your California Consumer Privacy Act rights.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
deny you goods or services;
charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts
or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level
or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result
in different prices, rates or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer
will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms
that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program
requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
European Residents
Podomatic, Inc. recognizes that the European Economic Area (“EEA”) has established strict protections
regarding the handling of certain personally identifiable information that we may receive from visitors
to or users of the Services in the EEA, including requirements to provide adequate protection of such
information outside of the EEA. Where we collect personally identifiable information relating to
individuals in the EEA, it will be transferred to our servers within the United States.
Under European data protection law, in certain circumstances, you may have the following rights:
the right to request access to any personally identifiable information that we hold about you
as well as related information, including the purposes for processing the information, the
recipients or categories of recipients with whom the information has been shared, where possible,
the period for which the information will be stored, the source of the information, and the
existence of any automated decision making;
the right to obtain without undue delay the rectification of any inaccurate personally
identifiable information that we hold about you;
the right to request that personally identifiable information held about you be deleted;
the right to prevent or restrict processing of your personally identifiable information; and
the right to request the transfer of personally identifiable information directly to a
third party where this is technically feasible.
Where the processing of your personally identifiable information is based on your previously given consent,
you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You may also have the right to object to the
processing of your personally identifiable information on grounds relating to your particular situation.
We will collect, use and share personally identifiable information in the same manner and for the same
purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy.
In order to exercise your data protection rights, please contact Podomatic as described in the Contact Us
section
below
. Podomatic takes each request seriously and will comply with your request to the extent required
by applicable law. For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before responding to your request,
such as verifying that the email address from which you send the request matches your email address that
we have on file.
We will not be able to respond to a request if we no longer hold your personally identifiable information.
If you feel that you have not received a satisfactory response from us, you may consult with the data
protection authority in your country.
By choosing to visit or use the Services, or provide information to us, you agree that any dispute over
privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the laws of the State of
California and the United States of America. You also agree to abide by any dispute resolution mechanisms or
limitations on damages contained in our Terms of Service, or other agreements that we have with you.
Changes in this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. The date this
Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. If we decide to make any changes to our
Privacy Policy, we will notify you of those changes by posting on the Websites and other places we deem
appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances,
if any, we disclose it.
Children Under 13
Our Websites and Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. Still, we recognize that children
may gain access to our Website and Services, so it is possible that we may collect personally identifiable
information from children in connection with such access. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
and its rules (collectively, “COPPA”) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this
section, “parents”) about our practices for collecting, using and disclosing personal information
from children under a certain age (each a “child,” collectively “children”).
Certain content and features are only accessible by registered users and we endeavor to limit our collection,
use and disclosure of personally identifiable information to that of our registered users. However, anyone
(including children) can access any of the publicly available parts of our Websites and Services and
any public content without providing us with their personally identifiable information.
Further, we have taken certain measures to prevent children from registering on the Websites and Services and,
except in connection with those measures, we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose the
personally identifiable information from children under 13. For example, we request that each
person seeking to register for an account provide us with information used to determine
that person’s age. If a potential registrant is identified as being a child, or we learn that
we have collected or received personal information from a child without verification of
parental consent, we will delete that child’s information.
We also use certain technologies, such as cookies, to automatically collect information from our
unregistered users (including children) when they visit or use the Websites and Services.
However, such information may be considered “personal information” under COPPA but
it is collected only to support our internal operations. Specifically, we use cookies
to recognize a child that has been unable to register for an account, for the sole purpose of
preventing him or her from circumventing our age verification procedures.
If you are under 13, do not, without parental consent, use or provide any information on the Websites,
or through any of their features, register for an account for the Services or provide any information
about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any username
you may use. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please
contact us at
legal@podomatic.com
.

“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services.

Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the

For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.

You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe

Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users.

This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our

During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User.

PayPal Privacy Statement
Last updated on February 13, 2025
Overview
PayPal, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “PayPal”) provides this Privacy Statement to describe our use of your Personal Information when you use your PayPal account, Xoom account, visit our websites, or apply for, or use our Services, like Braintree and Zettle. This Privacy Statement does not apply to Excluded Services, such as Venmo and Hyperwallet.
We encourage you to read this Privacy Statement and to use it to help you make informed decisions.
Certain capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in the Statement are explained in the
Definitions
section below.
We revise this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes to our business, Services, or applicable laws. If the revised version requires notice in accordance with applicable law, we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the change on the "
Policy Updates
" or "
Privacy Statement
" page of our website, otherwise the revised Privacy Statement will be effective as of the published effective date. If you are a new User or are receiving this Privacy Statement for the first time and there is an upcoming change described on the
Policy Updates
or Privacy Statement page at the time you receive this Privacy Statement, such upcoming change will apply to you on the indicated effective date.
For most of our Services, we act as a “data controller” or “business”, however there are some products and features where PayPal may also act as a “data processor” or “service provider” when providing services to our Partners and Merchants.  The “data controller” or “business” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that has the control over the purposes and means by which the data processing is performed.  The “data processor” or “service provider” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that processes the Personal Information for the data controller, for the data controller’s specific purposes, and as otherwise permitted under applicable data protection laws.
Non-Account Holders and Fastlane Profile Users
Our Services may be accessed by individuals without a PayPal or Xoom account. We will collect Personal Information from you even if you are a non-account holder when you use our Services, such as when you use our Pay Without a PayPal account, use Unbranded Payment Services (e.g., Braintree and Zettle), use a Fastlane profile, or when a non-accountholder receives a payment through the Visa+ service from a PayPal account holder (“Recipient”). If you Pay Without a PayPal account, we may link your transaction information with your PayPal account, if you have one at the time you use the Service without logging in, or if you create a PayPal account later.
With a Fastlane profile, individuals can store their payment methods and other Personal Information with PayPal so that they can complete the checkout process faster,  create a store or loyalty account, or facilitate other transactions at participating Partners and Merchants with payment card, contact information, shipping data or other data they save in their Fastlane profile as relevant to the specific interaction, participating Partner or Merchant, all without having to manually input payment method details and other Personal Information each time they checkout ("Fastlane").
When you create a Fastlane profile, you are agreeing to let PayPal store your Personal Information, including your name, email, phone number, address information, billing information and payment method details, and other data that may be relevant to specific Partner or Merchant interactions, and pre-populate that information in the checkout flows or other interactive features of participating Partners and Merchants so that you can  enjoy a faster Partner and Merchant experience by not having to manually input  your payment or other information. We will also collect transaction and other Partner or Merchant data related to your purchases and other Partner or Merchant interactions when you use Fastlane. If you have a Fastlane profile, we may recognize you as a Fastlane user when you shop on the participating Partners’ and Merchants’ sites, and we may prompt you to engage in participating Partner or Merchant interactions, such as registering for a store or loyalty account using your Fastlane profile information. If you choose to interact with participating Partners or Merchants through Fastlane, you agree to let PayPal disclose your Fastlane profile information to the Participating Partners and Merchants and their service providers, and to facilitate your transaction and shopping experience on the participating Partners and Merchants sites.
The Visa+ Service enables eligible customers with a PayPal account to send and receive money to and from Venmo and third-party Visa+-enabled digital wallets (“Visa+”).
When you shop on Partner and Merchant sites, the Partner or Merchant may disclose Personal Information with PayPal that we will use in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the relevant PayPal user agreement.

Your Data Protection Rights
Your rights to access, correction, deletion, and restriction to use or share your Personal Information.
Under applicable data protection law, depending upon the jurisdiction in which you reside and subject to applicable exceptions and definitional differences among various state laws, you may have certain rights about how your Personal Information is collected, stored, used and shared.
We recognize the importance of your ability to control the use of your Personal Information and provide several ways for you to exercise your rights to access (right to know your information), right to know third-parties to which we have disclosed Personal Information, correction, deletion (erasure), and to restrict certain information (right to opt-out of sharing and right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information).
Certain state laws also provide residents of those states with the right to opt out of the “sale” (disclosing Personal Information in exchange for money or other consideration) or “sharing” (disclosing Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising) of your Personal Information or use of your Personal Information for certain types of targeted advertising.  Global Privacy Control settings is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. PayPal does not respond to the Global Privacy Control signal because we do not sell or share your data.
We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights; although, certain personalized services for PayPal customers may not provide the same level of personalization with limited data sharing. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we handle your
Privacy Rights
.
How do you exercise your rights?
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information,
contact us
or submit your request from your account settings. If you have a PayPal account, you can exercise your privacy rights by accessing “Data and Privacy” from account settings in the PayPal app.
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information in your Fastlane profile,
contact us
or submit your request from your Fastlane profile management portal.
Even if you do not have a PayPal account (for example, where you use Pay without a PayPal account), you can submit a request for access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at the number provided in our
Contact Information
section.
We’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.
Your
right to request a copy of the Personal Information
. If you want to request the data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months, you have choices:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and submit a request
Call or contact us

PayPal does not respond to these settings because we do not sell or share data. Some personal information collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution are subject to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our
Consumer Privacy Notice
for more information about their rights under US federal law.
Understanding your choices
You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.
Choose how we collect Personal Information
You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function.
For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.
Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information
If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.
You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.
Choose what we disclose with other Users
Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.
Choose what we share with Partners and Merchants for Personalized Shopping
Unless we are required by law to obtain your consent, we share Personal Information collected after November 27, 2024 (or from earlier if you consent) for personalized shopping experiences. Personal Information we disclose includes, for example, products, preferences, sizes, and styles we think you’ll like. To opt-out of Personal Information sharing with Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences, log into your PayPal account and edit your preferences in the Data and Privacy setting. If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.
Choose how we communicate with you
Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Fastlane profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.
You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal or Fastlane marketing email, opt-out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.
You won’t be able to opt-out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account or Fastlane profile's status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.
How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?
We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and account/Fastlane profile registration information and verifying that the Personal Information we maintain about you is accurate and current.

CCPA California Notice at Collection
Most of the Personal Information we collect is subject to federal and state privacy laws that apply to financial institutions. To the extent the Personal Information is not subject to these federal and state financial privacy laws and to the extent it is collected in California about California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may apply. The following section pertains only to Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA (“CCPA personal information”) and makes statements that reference unique definitions and requirements of law.
This CCPA California Notice at Collection describes: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “CCPA personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose CCPA personal information for a business purpose, and/or (b) “share” CCPA personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or (c) “sell” such CCPA personal information, as applicable.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the sharing or disclosure of CCPA personal information by a business to a third party, for the targeting of advertising to a consumer, based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s CCPA activity across businesses, websites, applications, or services, other than those with which a consumer uses or directs a business to internally disclose CCPA personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties. “Selling” is defined as the disclosure of CCPA personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, but does not apply to such disclosures when a consumer uses or directs a business to intentionally disclose CCPA personal information or interact with one or more third parties.
We do not sell or share your CCPA personal information, including any Sensitive CCPA personal information, outside the exceptions.
We also do not sell or share, and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any CCPA personal information of anyone under 16 years of age.
