About Indeed Flex
Indeed Flex (“Flex”) is a flexible staffing platform that connects workers with employers in the industrial, facilities management, and retail sectors.
Previously known as “Syft” in the UK, Flex is bringing flexibility and control back to the hands of employers and workers in staffing.
Breaking from the traditional staffing agency model, Flex seeks to benefit both employers and workers through technological innovation. An easy-to-use app which features qualified workers and a range of businesses; experienced workers who are verified by the Flex team and ready at short notice; a rating system where you can see Flexers’ previous job ratings and rate them after each shift. Flex saves employers time, money and provides a better staffing experience for both workers and businesses.

Welcome
Indeed Flex’s core mission is to provide job seekers with a fast way to find temporary work that fits their lifestyles and to provide employers with a better staffing experience. With the backing, support, and resources of Indeed, the world’s #1 job site, we’re striving to transform the temporary staffing landscape to make access to work and job seekers fast and frictionless.
Since each of Indeed’s Affiliates and Brands (as detailed in our
HR Tech Privacy Center
) shares the mission to help people get jobs, and help employers find great candidates, we developed the
Privacy Center
as a way of educating our users about our affiliates, and how we share data with them to provide the strongest product and service offerings to our users. You can find out more about how we share data between affiliates on our
Privacy Center FAQ page
.
We’ve recently updated our Privacy Policy to maintain trust and to ensure that our Privacy Policy clearly explains how we collect and use personal and non-personal data.
Here’s a summary of key updates:
We have made changes to the structure and layout of our Privacy Policy to make it easier to read and understand.
We have added more detail about the information we collect, how we use Personal Data, and the legal bases we rely upon to use Personal Data.
We have updated our Region-Specific information section in attention to updates to the California Consumer Privacy Act in the California Privacy Rights Act (together, the “CCPA”) that went into effect on January 1, 2023.
We have expanded our Region-Specific information to include new U.S. state privacy laws and clarified our approach to the “Do Not Sell” requirement under the CCPA.
We have provided additional details on automated processing and the forms of appeal for automated decisions.
We have clarified Flex roles, such as Agency Worker and Client Worker, and their respective data processing responsibilities.
We have refined definitions to align with updated data protection regulations and updated the information collected sections to provide greater transparency.
We have provided additional details for exercising privacy rights, appealing denied requests, and contacting the appropriate data protection authorities.
We encourage you to review the “Last Updated” legend below to determine when it was last amended. Any changes to the Privacy Policy become effective on the “Last Updated” date indicated below.
If Indeed Flex is going to use Personal Data collected through the Sites in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, then Indeed Flex will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on the applicable Sites for 30 days prior to such use or by other means as required by law.
Indeed Flex reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time.
Privacy Policy
Last updated: 12 December 2024

Introduction
This Privacy Policy details the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal data provided to Indeed Flex (referred to here as “Flex”) when you access or use Flex’s online and/or mobile services, applications, and websites, and software provided by Flex on or in connection with such services or websites (the “Sites”).
The Flex App (UK site:
https://indeedflex.co.uk/
US site:
https://indeedflex.com/
) connects Clients with Flexers at a lower cost than a traditional flexible staffing agency. Flex+ (
https://indeedflex.co.uk/indeedflexplus/
) is a platform used by Clients for scheduling Client Workers, Flexers and Agency Workers.  We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand what data we collect, how that data is used, and the ways it can be shared by us and you.
1.1 Who is Responsible for Your Information
This section explains when Indeed Flex is either a controller or a processor of your Personal Information, and which entity is responsible for your Personal Data.
The ‘data controller’, which is the entity responsible for your information, will depend on your location and what kind of worker you are when using the Apps. For Flexers, Indeed Flex is the Controller of your information. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Flex”, “Syft”, “we”, “us” and “our” means:
Syft Online Limited T/A Indeed Flex if you are located in the United Kingdom;
Indeed Flex Inc. if you are located in the United States; and
Indeed Ireland Operations Limited (‘
Indeed Ireland
’) if you are located anywhere else.
If you are a Client Worker, the Client is your data controller and in certain circumstances Indeed Flex is the data processor in respect of your personal data. If you are an Agency Worker, the Agency that employs or engages you and Indeed Flex are separate Controllers of your information.
For Clients and Flexers outside the United States, Syft Online Limited T/A Indeed Flex and Indeed Operations Ireland Limited act as independent controllers of your personal data in certain instances and have determined their respective responsibilities for compliance with applicable data protection laws in this regard.

1.3 The Scope of Indeed Flex’s Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers data that we collect through the Sites, directly from data subjects, or that we obtain from third parties. In cases where you follow a link to a third-party website, you are no longer covered by our Privacy Policy, and any data collection or processing activity that takes place on that website will be governed by that website’s own privacy policy. We only collect data on the Sites that display a direct link to this Privacy Policy.
The Sites are not for use by anyone under the age of 18 or the applicable minimum age provided for in local laws. In all jurisdictions outside the UK or EEA, if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use the Sites under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian, or responsible adult.
Indeed Flex adopts a range of measures to try to ensure that we do not accept individuals who do not meet the minimum age and any other applicable age requirements. These measures can include but are not limited to confirmation of the date of birth during the application process, and confirmation of documentation provided.
If you are applying to work directly for Indeed Flex UK or US as an employee, and not as part of the App offering, please refer to the
Applicant Privacy Policy
.
Current and former employees of Indeed Flex should reach out to their Human Resources partner to reference the Global Employee Privacy Notice.
2. Data Collection and Use
2.1 Information that Indeed Flex Collects
In accordance with applicable data protection laws in the UK and the EEA, controllers must have a legal basis to process Personal Data. This means we rely on different legal bases to process your Personal Data, depending on the purpose of processing outlined in this Privacy Policy. Where Indeed Flex collects or processes sensitive personal information, it is done without the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer.
Full details of the types of personal data we collect from you, the purpose of processing it, our processing operations, and details of the legal bases we rely upon for UK GDPR are detailed below.
2.2 Retention of Your Information
Where Indeed Flex acts as a controller of your Personal Data, we retain such data until it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose it is being used for, as required by applicable laws,  or until you ask us to delete it.
In determining these appropriate retention periods, we consider the purposes for which we process Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We also consider the extent, nature, and sensitivity of Personal Data and our legal obligations with respect to data. Where possible and relying on our legitimate interest in improving our Sites, Flex anonymizes or aggregates Personal Data, so that it can no longer be associated with or identify a user, in which case Indeed Flex can further process the information. Go
here
for more information on our retention periods.
Where Indeed acts as the Processor of your Personal Data, we store such data until instructed to delete it by the relevant Controller.

3. Disclosures and transfers of your information
3.1 Sharing your information with Flex Affiliated Entities and Websites
As mentioned above, our core mission is to connect workers with Clients which is a mission we share with each of our affiliates. In order to support that mission we share certain information with our affiliates. Such information sharing is governed by this Privacy Policy. We also developed the Privacy Centre as a way of educating our users about our affiliates and how we share data with them to provide the strongest product and service offerings to our users. We encourage you to visit the
Privacy Centre
to learn more.
Information shared by you with Indeed Flex may also be shared with any Indeed Flex affiliated entity, no matter where it is located, to provide you with enhanced and optimised functionality on Indeed Flex. This aligns closely with the purposes detailed in this Privacy Policy, in particular, by strengthening Indeed Flex’s ability to provide a simple and effective recruitment solution that connects Clients and Flexers. If you do not wish for your information to be transferred in this way you should not use the Apps.
For the purposes of this Policy, “affiliates” means any entity that directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control of or with a Indeed Flex entity, now or in the future. “Control” for these purposes means having a majority of shares or the right and ability to direct management. And this includes Indeed Flex affiliated entities located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom or Switzerland.
For more information on how we handle international transfers of data, please review
Section 4
: Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the UK and EEA.
Our affiliates and affiliated websites include:
Indeed
,
Glassdoor
,
Simply Hired
,
Resume.com
,
Workopolis
. In compliance with CCPA, we affirm that we do not have actual knowledge of selling or sharing the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information unless reasonably necessary and only for purposes permitted by CCPA, including but not limited to performance of services and user security.
Such data sharing with Indeed Flex affiliates will be performed for a number of specific reasons:
Improved Services
To provide Flexers with a more personalised and improved content, performance, features and services on Indeed Flex and its affiliates’ sites. For example, Indeed Flex and its affiliates will use your previous search and browsing history (e.g. the engagements/jobs you click on), IP address, or your profile information, to determine relevant search results. Such sharing will also be performed to facilitate improved data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement.
More Employers, More Job Listings and More Workers
Such data sharing will allow Flexers to access an even broader database of jobs and Clients, and for Clients to access more Flexers. For example, Indeed Flex will be able to recommend jobs or Clients on Flex or on websites of Flex affiliates, as well as facilitate applications and display engagements/job listings from the Apps to Flex affiliates’ websites and vice versa. Flex or another Flex affiliate will be able to recommend a Flexer to a Client hosted by Flex or to a Client hosted by a Flex affiliate. Equally, a Flex affiliate will be able to recommend an engagement/job listing hosted by a Flex Client to a Flexer hosted by a Flex affiliate. Indeed Flex and its affiliates will also be able to share Client data (such as account information and behavioural data) to provide a better experience to those Clients.
Better Security for Users
Such data sharing will allow Indeed Flex and Flex affiliated entities to process your personal data for the purpose of improving user security and internal operations, troubleshooting, and detecting and preventing fraud and spam.
3.2 Transfers of information to Clients
Indeed Flex shares Flexer information with Clients through the Apps.
If you are a Flexer using the Flex App, by applying or signing up for an engagement with a Client you agree to the disclosure of your personal data to that Client. It should however be noted that Indeed Flex provides limited information to Clients in such cases. Please also note that Clients process personal data received through the Apps as data controllers, independently responsible for their own handling of your personal data. As such, if you are a Flexer, any requests to exercise your rights in respect of personal data processed by a Client as Controller should be directed to that Client.
If you are a Client, you agree to process the personal data of Flexers, provided to you through the Flex App, only for the purpose of (i) availing of the Flex App service in accordance with the Flex App Terms and Conditions which includes engaging a Flexer or (ii) as otherwise required or permitted under applicable data protection laws. As a Client you further agree to comply with all of your obligations under applicable data protection laws with respect to the collection, processing and storage of Personal Data provided to you by Indeed Flex, including the provision of your own Privacy Notice to the worker where necessary.
3.3 Information shared with Clients by Workers
Indeed Flex is not responsible for or liable to the Client acting as Controller of data such as but not limited to data which Client is legally required to maintain, data which is uploaded to the platform, data  exchanged directly between Flexers/workers and Clients during an engagement or otherwise shared with one another outside of the Apps, Clients processing data for their own purpose on the Flex+ App. Clients, as Data Controllers are responsible for their own processing of worker information.

4. Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the UK and EEA
Information shared by you with Indeed Flex will be shared with our service providers and other Indeed Flex affiliated entities, no matter where they are located, for the purpose of providing you with the Apps and improving the Apps, and any other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This means that your personal data will be transferred to other countries, both inside and outside of the UK and the EEA.
We rely on a combination of legal mechanisms to support transfers of personal data outside of the UK and the EEA, which may include, where appropriate, the execution of Standard Contractual Clauses with the relevant recipients to ensure that any personal data transferred is subject to appropriate safeguards and other decisions from appropriate authorities that a third country provides an adequate level of protection.
4.1 GDPR Protections
Transfers which are subject to the GDPR  are performed based on agreements that also incorporate the protections and requirements provided for under Chapter V (and Article 28, where appropriate) of the GDPR. This incorporates EU data protection requirements to ensure adequate protection of such personal data transfers.
5. Automated Processing
In order to optimise the performance of the Apps and the Site, Flex performs automated processing of personal data including profiling in limited instances. This processing involves the Apps suggesting suitable engagements for you on our platform, on the basis of your Skills, experience and previous ratings. As explained below, Flex also uses automation to help prioritize candidates for interviews, and Flex and Clients use automation to shortlist suitable candidates for shifts.
Automation related to Flex interviews
Flex uses a machine learning model to help prioritize candidates for interviews. The model factors in your experience and proximity to the work site. Even if you’re not automatically selected, you can re-apply at any time and remain eligible to apply for other jobs. Our recruiters may also still contact you for an interview if a spot becomes available.
Automation related to strikes and bans – only Flexers
If you are a Flexer, your work performance will be assessed based on certain behaviours. Certain actions may result in you receiving a ‘strike’ or a ‘ban’ from Clients and are recorded on the Flex platform.  These ratings are visible to Clients. If you receive 3 ‘strikes’ then this results in a ‘ban’ from the App, a ban can also result in certain behaviours as explained below and can be manual or automatic. You can object to strikes and bans and will be offered a manual review of the rating. If you are banned from the platform your access will be revoked.
Client Workers and Agency Workers on the Flex+ platform can receive ratings from the Client for internal quality control, but they are not subject to the strikes and ban automation.
For more details on Strikes and Bans, please refer to our Flexer Terms and Conditions (
UK Flexer Terms
,
US Flexer Terms
)
Automatic Strike – Lateness – If you are 15 mins late to a shift you will receive a strike notification 2 hours after your shift ends;
Automatic Ban – No Show – Failure to attend a shift without notification will result in an automatic ban;
Manual Ban – If you cancel a shift less than 24 hours, but more than 30 minutes, before that shift is due to start – You will be banned from our service when 3 activated strikes are accumulated against your profile at the same time;
Manual Strike – Strikes can result from negative feedback/ratings from clients including but not limited to: wrong uniform, bad attitude or incidents.
If a strike or ban is applied to your profile, you will receive an email notification with the details. To contest a ban or strike, you can reply to the email notification to raise a support ticket. This will offer you a right to discuss the strike and whether it is justified.
Automation related to ‘ratings’ –
only Flexers
Automatic 5* Rating – We start everyone at 5* to help them get their first shift. This rating disappears after the first rating from a Client;
Automatic venue block – If a client rates you less than or equal to 3* on a role, you will get automatically blocked from future offers for that venue;
Automatic preferred Flexer – If a client rates you as 5* on a role, you will get added to the Client’s preferred staff pool;
Automatic skill progression – Ratings of 4/5* by Clients lets them comment on additional skills that you have displayed during the engagement. This can increase the skills listed on your profile and may increase the job offers that you are eligible for;
Manual ratings and comments – Ratings from Clients to Flexers are made after every engagement is completed;
Manual ratings and comments – Ratings from Flexers to Clients are made after every engagement is completed.
Automation related to work history –
only Flexers
Work history and references require a valid contact name and email address to verify.  You should ensure that you have your referee’s permission to supply their contact details (Email, Name, Phone number) to Flex.
Automation related to surveys –
only Flexers
Surveys on satisfaction are sent on an automatic cadence to measure engagement, your preferences relating to engagements, and to improve our product and services.
Automation related to right to work or critical documents –
only Flexers
If your right to work document expires, you will be automatically unverified. If you are not verified, you cannot receive offers through the platform. Please ensure that you maintain up to date right to work documents.
Smart matching feature
Flex offers Clients several smart matching features that assist Clients in offering and assigning engagements to Flexers. Depending on the specific options that a Client selects, our smart matching will determine which Engagements are shown to Flexers on the Flex App. The smart matching feature may also offer engagements to Flexers and Client Workers on a priority order basis, and determine which Flexers and Client Workers are accepted for an Engagement based on the criteria described below.
Skills: this criteria considers whether the Flexer has the skills required for the job, such as whether the Flexer has been verified for the role through the onboarding and verification process, and whether the Flexer has the Skills requested by the Client on the Flex Platform.
If a Flexer’s onboarding document that allows them to work for Flex expires, such as their right to work document, they will be automatically unverified in the Platform. Flexers who are not verified are unable to receive Engagement offers or apply for Engagements through the platform.
Flexer / Client Worker preferences availability: this criteria considers whether the Flexer / Client Worker is available for the Engagement and whether the Flexer / Client Worker’s preferences match the terms of the Engagement. For example, to be eligible for an Engagement, the Flexer / Client Worker must not already be booked for conflicting Engagements. The hourly rate and location for the Engagement must also match the Flexer / Client Worker’s pay and location preferences.
Performance: this criteria considers whether the Flexer meets minimum performance standards for the Engagement. This includes a Flexer’s average rating and other performance-related standards, such as how frequently the Flexer is late or does not show up for a shift.
Flexer activity on the Flex App: this criteria considers the Flexer’s interactions with the Flex App. For example, Flexers who have been inactive on the app for over three months may not be considered eligible for an Engagement.
Client Preferences: this criteria considers whether the Flexer or Agency Worker meets the Client’s set preferences. For example, Clients may choose to prioritize offers to Flexer or Agency Worker who have worked with them before. They may also exclude Flexer or Agency Workers they have not had a good experience with.
To the extent that our smart matching features rely on automation, such processing is carried out where it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with our users and to allow Flex to provide its services to Flexers and Clients.
Forms of Appeal for Automated Processing

Please note that when you use our services, either as a Client or a Flexer, the processing of your information, and/or that of your team who you nominate to liaise with us, will become a condition of the contract between us as we require certain information in order to be able to provide you with our services (e.g. contact information, ‘right to work’ documentation etc.). In those circumstances, if you do not provide certain information when requested, we may be unable to provide our services to you.
6.2 Exercising your rights

form
.
You can exercise all of the other rights at any time by contacting us at privacy @ indeedflex.com (remove spaces). Please note that we may attempt, where reasonably necessary, to verify your identity through the email address or telephone number associated with your use of the Apps prior to fulfilling any such request and reserve the right to deny a request where we are unable to satisfactorily complete this process.

7. Your U.S. Privacy Rights
Some U.S. states have privacy laws providing privacy rights to their residents. These laws include the; Texas Data Privacy Security Act (TDPSA), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act, Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act, Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act. However, these rights are available to all Indeed Flex users subject to certain legal obligations and limitations.
See
Section 6
of our Privacy Policy for guidance on how to exercise your rights or call our designated toll-free telephone number at 800-616-6535.

“Do not sell my personal information”
requirement, how it may apply to your use of our Site, and how you can exercise this right, please go to

Indeed Flex records Do Not Sell (DNS) opt-out preferences on a user-account basis, without linking them to IP addresses, cookies, or other tracking identifiers. While users have the option to opt out of the selling or sharing of data, this preference is not currently integrated with cookie-based tracking settings. Should Indeed Flex engage in the selling or sharing of personal information as defined by CCPA and CPRA in the future, we would fully respect and enforce user opt-out preferences.

We cookies to enhance your experience when you visit the Apps, either as a user of the Apps or other visitor. A cookie is a text file that websites send to a user’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the device and browser or to store information or settings in a browser. Cookies help distinguish you from other users of the Apps and help personalise your experience.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but browser settings can be changed to prevent these cookies from collecting information. You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you set your browser to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our website and some of the services you request through the Apps may not work correctly.
Two kinds of cookies are used on the Apps – session cookies and persistent cookies.
1. Session cookies are used to remember selections made when you use the Apps. Session cookies are deleted automatically when you leave the Apps or close your browser.
2. Persistent cookies are used to identify you when you return to the Apps and/or to remember specific information about your preferences. These cookies also help us understand browsing behaviour within the Apps, which can help us develop the Apps in a way we believe will be most relevant to your interests. Persistent cookies are stored on your device and are not deleted when the browser is closed, they remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie) – these cookies must be ‘manually’ deleted if you want to remove them.
First and third party cookies
We set cookies (first party cookies) on our web pages, however, where we require additional information or services, we also allow other companies to host cookies on our web pages (third-party cookies). These partner companies have been carefully selected by us.
What do we use cookies for?
The cookies we use are categorised into five groups:
1.
Strictly Necessary cookies
– these cookies are used for technical reasons and are necessary to enable the Apps to operate efficiently so that you can navigate the Apps with ease and use specific features. These include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of the Apps and cookies that help us to debug any errors. The type of personal data which may be collected through these cookies includes IP address; location data and the fact that you are logged on to the Apps. These cookies are deleted when you leave the Apps or close your browser and do not store your preferences or information beyond your current visit. If these cookies are blocked or disabled, some of the Apps’ functions will not be available to you and you may not be able to use our service.
2.
Performance cookies
– these cookies are used to obtain statistics about the number of users of the Apps and how such users interact with the Apps. These cookies collect information that is aggregated and therefore cannot be used to identify an individual’s identity. This data is used to analyse things like how frequently people visit the Apps, how it is found and which pages are most frequently viewed. Such information allows us to continuously improve the Apps to provide users with a better online experience (such as enabling users to find what they are looking for more easily). These cookies remain on your device for varying periods with some deleted when you close your browser and others remaining on your device until deleted.
3.
Functionality cookies
– these cookies are used to improve the functionality of the Apps and make it easier to use. They help us to identify you as a repeat user of the Apps and help us remember your preferences (such as choice of language, country setting or mobile device preferences, for example), which saves you time by making the user experience easier. In order to provide these features these cookies do collect your personal information. Usually functionality cookies expire after a maximum of 2 years but they can be deleted from your browser history at any time up to the point of their expiry.
4.
Analytical
– these cookies gather information about your habits when using the Apps (including the pages you have visited). We may combine such information with other personal data that we have collected about you (for example your user profile) to enhance the Apps and make them more tailored to you. These cookies may be placed on the Apps by carefully selected third parties such as Google Analytics, on our behalf (with our permission) in order to help us collect statistical data about users of the Apps and conduct market research. These cookies remain on your device for varying periods with some deleted when you close your browser and others remaining on your device until deleted.
To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites please visit:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
5. Advertising/Targeted Cookies
– these cookies are used to deliver advertisements relevant to you, based upon your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. These cookies record your visit to the Apps, the pages you have visited and the services/features you have selected. We will use this information to make the Apps and the advertising displayed more relevant to your interests. These cookies are also used to link to social media networks and other third parties which may also use this information about your visit to target advertising to you.

Introduction
Introduction
Our privacy values
The benefits of data sharing
Platform activity recording
Welcome to the HR Tech Privacy Center
APP USERS: Use of our app is subject to the Terms and Privacy Policy for that app and website. For privacy information about the app you are using, please review the Privacy Policy for its website. For example, the use of the Indeed app is subject to the Indeed Terms and Privacy Policy.
Introduction
We take your personal data seriously
Welcome to the HR Tech Privacy Center – a website detailing how multiple online job search and recruitment
platforms
share data and protect privacy. The Indeed Platform includes the
Indeed sites
, and the Glassdoor Platform includes the
Glassdoor sites
(together, the “Platforms”). For more details about the appropriate data controller for each platform, please check
Indeed Privacy Policy
and
Glassdoor Privacy Policy
.
Our core mission is to help people get jobs and help employers find great candidates. We developed this website to help you learn more about our
Privacy Values
, how your data is shared between these platforms, and why it’s important for us to share it.
Sharing data between the Platforms allows us to:
Help connect job seekers with more job listings and employers
Improve and customize services for our users
Enhance security for our users
You can find out about how we share data between the Platforms
below
or find answers to some
frequently asked questions
.
The information provided here doesn’t change how each of the Indeed sites and the Glassdoor sites collects, uses, or shares personal data. The Privacy and Cookie policies for each site clearly explain how we collect and use personal and non-personal data.
If you have specific questions about a particular platform, we encourage you to visit that Platform’s Privacy Policy or the Contact Us page for further information.
Our privacy values
Prioritizing your trust
Whether we’re helping you find jobs or great candidates, we value the trust you place in us. To maintain that trust, we make significant investments to protect your personal data. These efforts are guided by our privacy values:
We treat all users equally by providing a broad suite of global privacy rights. Any user can request the following:
access to and portability of their personal data
rectification or deletion of their personal data
restriction of or objection to certain processing of their personal data
We adhere to principles of privacy by design, which informs how we build and operate our services.
We’re transparent about what personal data we collect and how it’s processed.
We want to ensure the personal data we gather will be used for the purposes of helping our job seekers find jobs, our employers find great candidates, and improving the services we provide to you.
We limit our collection and storage of personal data to what’s adequate, relevant, and necessary.
We strive to keep your personal data accurate and up to date, where appropriate.
We want to process your personal data using appropriate security measures to protect personal data.
We demonstrate accountability and responsibility under applicable privacy laws.
The benefits of data sharing
Why do you need my data anyway?
Data sharing not only provides a range of benefits to job seekers and employers, but it also enables us to improve our services.
Data sharing means more employers, more job listings, and more job seekers
Data sharing between the Platforms allows job seekers to access a broader database of job listings and employers. It also helps employers access more job seekers. For example, one platform may be able to recommend jobs or employers on another platform. It can also help applications, resumes, or job listings work across the Platforms.  The personal data shared depends on your interaction with the platforms in the course of your job search and application activities.
The Platforms can also share employer data, such as account information and behavioral information, to provide a better experience to those employers.
Data sharing improves our services
Data sharing allows our Platforms to provide personalized and improved content, performance, features, and services.
For example, our Platforms may use and share your previous search or browsing history (e.g. the jobs you click on) and your profile data, including resume to determine relevant search results and job alerts. Data sharing may also help provide career insights such as company reviews, job listing salary data, interview tips, and more.
This sharing also helps improve data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement across our Platforms.
Data sharing facilitates better security
Sharing data allows our Platforms to better protect our users. In particular, it allows affiliated Platforms to improve user security and internal operations. It also facilitates troubleshooting and detection, and prevention of fraud and spam.
Platform activity recording
What we do with the data
We process your activity on the Platforms to help us better understand how you use them. This helps us improve and inform the products and services we offer. All of which allows us to help you find jobs.
It’s important to note that our Platforms may not work as intended without certain data collection and sharing. This includes processing, collecting, analyzing, storing, and sharing personal data across the Platforms or with third-party service providers, including in real-time.
Data collected can include any and all interactions and communications you have on our Platforms. It may also include without limitation the areas of the Platforms you visit and where you click, scroll, hover, mouseover, or otherwise interact with our Platforms. It may also include when and for how long each activity occurs.
For more information, please see the Privacy and Cookie policies for each Platform.
We consider this processing to be critical to the way our Platforms operate, and, at this time, without transferring certain data to Indeed’s affiliates, we are not able to provide our core products and services to you. Please, check our FAQ to understand how you can stop this sharing.
Frequently Asked Questions
Personal data sharing
What personal data is shared between the Platforms?
What personal data is shared is determined by the Privacy and Cookie policies of the Platforms you use.
The personal data shared depends on your interaction with the Platforms in the course of your job search and application activities. It may include your first and last name, user name, email address, telephone number, profile data, including resume , IP address, advertiser ID, answers to any employer screener questions, job listings, job notifications, application progress, and users’ search, click and session activity on the Platforms.
Why is my personal data shared in this way?
Your personal data is shared for a few reasons, including to:
Connect more job seekers with more job listings and employers
Improve our services
Facilitate better security for users
More details on the
benefits of data sharing
are available to you.
When is data shared and how does sharing take place?
When and how your personal data is shared depends on the individual Platform, the type of data being shared, and the actions you take on the Platforms.
For example, our Platforms may use and share your previous search or browsing history (e.g. the jobs you click on) and your profile data, including resume to determine relevant search results and job alerts. Specific actions may also automatically initiate sharing, such as opening an account on one of our Platforms.
How do I stop my personal data from being shared in this way?
Indeed values your privacy and tries to facilitate your preferences. If you do not wish your information to be shared in this way, depending on the site, you can request the deletion of your account, request the deletion of your personal data, or request that your data not be shared this way while maintaining an account. These options can be requested by following the instructions in the Privacy Policy of the sites you have used.
HR Tech Privacy Center and the Platforms
Does the information in the HR Tech Privacy Center change how my personal data will be used?
No, the information set out in our FAQs and Privacy Center is designed to provide you with more transparency about how we use data.
Does this mean that all my data is shared by the Platforms without restriction?
No, the sharing of your personal data is governed by the provisions of the privacy and cookie policies of the Platforms you have used. We encourage you to refer to those provisions, so you have a clear understanding.
How do the Platforms manage the transfer of my personal data among the affiliated Platforms?
We use various mandated legal methods to ensure that adequate protections are applied to the transfer of data. That may include one or a combination of measures. This may include
standard contractual clauses
or other mechanisms as we determine to be appropriate to adequately protect transfers of your personal data.
Who is the data controller of my personal data?
The data controller of your personal data should be specified in the Privacy Policy of the Platform you used.
How do the Platforms view privacy?
The HR Tech Platforms take the privacy of their users very seriously. We invest significant resources as part of our efforts to protect your personal data and endeavor to adhere to applicable privacy rules. We very much value the trust that our job seekers place in us to help them find jobs, and our employers place in us to help them find great candidates. Please consult our
Privacy Values
for more information.
In what language does each Platform provide its privacy or cookie policy?
A Platform’s Privacy and Cookie policy is available in the local languages of the markets targeted by that Platform. If a particular Platform does not have its privacy or cookie policy in a specific language, it is because the Platform does not yet target users in markets where that language applies.
Your privacy rights

Welcome to the HR Tech Privacy Center
APP USERS: Use of our app is subject to the Terms and Privacy Policy for that app and website. For privacy information about the app you are using, please review the Privacy Policy for its website. For example, the use of the Indeed app is subject to the Indeed Terms and Privacy Policy.
Introduction
We take your personal data seriously
Welcome to the HR Tech Privacy Center – a website detailing how multiple online job search and recruitment
platforms
share data and protect privacy. The Indeed Platform includes the
Indeed sites
, and the Glassdoor Platform includes the
Glassdoor sites
(together, the “Platforms”). For more details about the appropriate data controller for each platform, please check
Indeed Privacy Policy
and
Glassdoor Privacy Policy
.
Our core mission is to help people get jobs and help employers find great candidates. We developed this website to help you learn more about our
Privacy Values
, how your data is shared between these platforms, and why it’s important for us to share it.
Sharing data between the Platforms allows us to:
Help connect job seekers with more job listings and employers
Improve and customize services for our users
Enhance security for our users
You can find out about how we share data between the Platforms
below
or find answers to some
frequently asked questions
.
The information provided here doesn’t change how each of the Indeed sites and the Glassdoor sites collects, uses, or shares personal data. The Privacy and Cookie policies for each site clearly explain how we collect and use personal and non-personal data.
If you have specific questions about a particular platform, we encourage you to visit that Platform’s Privacy Policy or the Contact Us page for further information.
Our privacy values
Prioritizing your trust
Whether we’re helping you find jobs or great candidates, we value the trust you place in us. To maintain that trust, we make significant investments to protect your personal data. These efforts are guided by our privacy values:
We treat all users equally by providing a broad suite of global privacy rights. Any user can request the following:
access to and portability of their personal data
rectification or deletion of their personal data
restriction of or objection to certain processing of their personal data
We adhere to principles of privacy by design, which informs how we build and operate our services.
We’re transparent about what personal data we collect and how it’s processed.
We want to ensure the personal data we gather will be used for the purposes of helping our job seekers find jobs, our employers find great candidates, and improving the services we provide to you.
We limit our collection and storage of personal data to what’s adequate, relevant, and necessary.
We strive to keep your personal data accurate and up to date, where appropriate.
We want to process your personal data using appropriate security measures to protect personal data.
We demonstrate accountability and responsibility under applicable privacy laws.
The benefits of data sharing
Why do you need my data anyway?
Data sharing not only provides a range of benefits to job seekers and employers, but it also enables us to improve our services.
Data sharing means more employers, more job listings, and more job seekers
Data sharing between the Platforms allows job seekers to access a broader database of job listings and employers. It also helps employers access more job seekers. For example, one platform may be able to recommend jobs or employers on another platform. It can also help applications, resumes, or job listings work across the Platforms.  The personal data shared depends on your interaction with the platforms in the course of your job search and application activities.
The Platforms can also share employer data, such as account information and behavioral information, to provide a better experience to those employers.
Data sharing improves our services
Data sharing allows our Platforms to provide personalized and improved content, performance, features, and services.
For example, our Platforms may use and share your previous search or browsing history (e.g. the jobs you click on) and your profile data, including resume to determine relevant search results and job alerts. Data sharing may also help provide career insights such as company reviews, job listing salary data, interview tips, and more.
This sharing also helps improve data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement across our Platforms.
Data sharing facilitates better security
Sharing data allows our Platforms to better protect our users. In particular, it allows affiliated Platforms to improve user security and internal operations. It also facilitates troubleshooting and detection, and prevention of fraud and spam.
Platform activity recording
What we do with the data
We process your activity on the Platforms to help us better understand how you use them. This helps us improve and inform the products and services we offer. All of which allows us to help you find jobs.
It’s important to note that our Platforms may not work as intended without certain data collection and sharing. This includes processing, collecting, analyzing, storing, and sharing personal data across the Platforms or with third-party service providers, including in real-time.
Data collected can include any and all interactions and communications you have on our Platforms. It may also include without limitation the areas of the Platforms you visit and where you click, scroll, hover, mouseover, or otherwise interact with our Platforms. It may also include when and for how long each activity occurs.
For more information, please see the Privacy and Cookie policies for each Platform.
We consider this processing to be critical to the way our Platforms operate, and, at this time, without transferring certain data to Indeed’s affiliates, we are not able to provide our core products and services to you. Please, check our FAQ to understand how you can stop this sharing.

California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
Updated on March 13, 2024
The
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
(CCPA) gives consumers more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them and the
CCPA regulations
provide guidance on how to implement the law.  This landmark law secures new privacy rights for California consumers, including:
The
right to know
about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared;
The
right to delete
personal information collected from them (with some exceptions);
The
right to opt-out
of the sale or sharing of their personal information including via the
GPC
;
The
right to non-discrimination
for exercising their CCPA rights.
In November of 2020, California voters approved
Proposition 24, the CPRA
, which amended the CCPA and added new additional privacy protections that began on January 1, 2023. As of January 1, 2023, consumers have new rights in addition to those above, such as:
The
right to correct
inaccurate personal information that a business has about them; and
The
right to limit
the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information collected about them.
Businesses
that are subject to the CCPA have several responsibilities, including responding to consumer requests to exercise these rights and giving consumers certain
notices explaining their privacy practices
. The CCPA applies to many businesses, including
data brokers
.
CPRA amends the CCPA; it does not create a separate, new law.  As a result, our office typically refers to the law as “CCPA” or “CCPA, as amended.”

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
These FAQs provide general consumer information about the CCPA and how you can exercise your rights under the CCPA. They are not legal advice, regulatory guidance, or an opinion of the Attorney General. We will update this information periodically.
A. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CCPA
1. What rights do I have under the CCPA?
If you are a California resident, you may ask businesses to disclose what personal information they have about you and what they do with that information, to delete your personal information, to direct businesses not to sell or share your personal information, to correct inaccurate information that they have about you, and to limit businesses’ use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information:
Right to know
: You can request that a business disclose to you: (1) the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information they have collected about you, (2) the categories of sources for that personal information, (3) the purposes for which the business uses that information, (4) the categories of third parties with whom the business discloses the information, and (5) the categories of information that the business sells or discloses to third parties. You can make a request to know up to twice a year, free of charge.
Right to delete
: You can request that businesses delete personal information they collected from you and tell their service providers to do the same, subject to certain exceptions (such as if the business is legally required to keep the information).
Right to opt-out of sale or sharing
: You may request that businesses stop selling or sharing your personal information (“opt-out”), including via a user-enabled global privacy control. Businesses cannot sell or share your personal information after they receive your opt-out request unless you later authorize them to do so again.
Right to correct
: You may ask businesses to correct inaccurate information that they have about you.
Right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information
: You can direct businesses to only use your sensitive personal information (for example, your social security number, financial account information, your precise geolocation data, or your genetic data) for limited purposes, such as providing you with the services you requested.
You also have the right to be notified, before or at the point businesses collect your personal information, of the types of personal information they are collecting and what they may do with that information. Generally, businesses cannot discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. Businesses cannot make you waive these rights, and any contract provision that says you waive these rights is unenforceable.
2. What if I am not a California resident?
Only California residents have rights under the CCPA. A California resident is a natural person (as opposed to a corporation or other business entity) who resides in California, even if the person is temporarily outside of the state.
3. What is considered personal information and sensitive personal information under the CCPA?
Personal information
is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with you or your household. For example, it could include your name, social security number, email address, records of products purchased, internet browsing history, geolocation data, fingerprints, and inferences from other personal information that could create a profile about your preferences and characteristics.
Sensitive personal information
is a specific subset of personal information that includes certain government identifiers (such as social security numbers); an account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number with any required security code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; precise geolocation; contents of mail, email, and text messages; genetic data; biometric information processed to identify a consumer; information concerning a consumer’s health, sex life, or sexual orientation; or information about racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership. Consumers have the right to also limit a business’s use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information.
Personal information does not include publicly available information (including public real estate/property records) and certain
types of information
.
4. What is not considered personal information under the CCPA?
Personal information does not include publicly available information that is from federal, state, or local government records, such as professional licenses and public real estate/property records.  The definition of publicly available information also includes information that a business has a reasonable basis to believe is lawfully made available to the general public by the consumer or from widely distributed media, or certain information disclosed by a consumer and made available if the consumer has not restricted the information to a specific audience.
The CCPA also exempts certain types of information such as certain medical information and consumer credit reporting information.
5. What businesses does the CCPA apply to?
The CCPA applies to for-profit businesses that do business in California and meet any of the following:
Have a gross annual revenue of over $25 million;
Buy, sell, or share the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents or households; or
Derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling California residents’ personal information.
6. Does the CCPA apply to nonprofits or government agencies?
The CCPA generally does not apply to nonprofit organizations or government agencies.
7. What can I do if I think a business violated the CCPA?
You cannot sue businesses for most CCPA violations. You can only sue a business under the CCPA if there is a data breach, and even then, only under limited circumstances. You can sue a business if your nonencrypted and nonredacted personal information was stolen in a data breach as a result of the business’s failure to maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect it. If this happens, you can sue for the amount of monetary damages you actually suffered from the breach or “statutory damages” of up to $750 per incident. Before suing, you must give the business written notice of which CCPA sections it violated and allow 30 days to respond in writing that it has cured the violations and that no further violations will occur. If the business is able to actually cure the violation and gives you its written statement that it has done so, you cannot sue the business, unless it continues to violate the CCPA contrary to its statement.
For all other violations of the CCPA, only the Attorney General or the California Privacy Protection Agency may take legal action against non-compliant entities. The Attorney General does not represent individual California consumers. Using consumer complaints and other information, the Attorney General may identify patterns of misconduct that may lead to investigations and actions on behalf of the collective legal interests of the people of California. If you believe a business has violated the CCPA, you may
file a consumer complaint
with the Office of the Attorney General. If you choose to file a complaint with our office, explain exactly how the business violated the CCPA, and describe when and how the violation occurred. Please note that the Attorney General cannot represent you or give you legal advice on how to resolve your individual complaint.  Starting on July 1, 2023, you also will be able to file complaints with the
California Privacy Protection Agency
for violations of the CCPA, as amended, occurring on or after that date.
8. What kind of data breach can I sue a business for under the CCPA?
You can only sue businesses under the CCPA if certain conditions are met. The type of personal information that must have been stolen is your first name (or first initial) and last name in combination with any of the following:
Your social security number
Your driver’s license number, tax identification number, passport number, military identification number, or other unique identification number issued on a government document commonly used to identify a person's identity
Your financial account number, credit card number, or debit card number if combined with any required security code, access code, or password that would allow someone access to your account
Your medical or health insurance information
Your fingerprint, retina or iris image, or other unique biometric data used to identify a person's identity (but not including photographs unless used or stored for facial recognition purposes)
This personal information must have been stolen in nonencrypted and nonredacted form. In addition, the personal information must have been stolen in a data breach as a result of the business’s failure to maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect it. If this happens, you can sue for the amount of monetary damages you actually suffered from the breach or “statutory damages” of up to $750 per incident. Before suing, you must give the business written notice of which CCPA sections it violated and allow 30 days to respond in writing that it has cured the violations and that no further violations will occur. If the business is able to actually cure the violation and gives you its written statement that it has done so, you cannot sue the business, unless it continues to violate the CCPA contrary to its statement.
9. Do businesses need to comply with the statutory CPRA amendments to the CCPA that went into effect on January 1, 2023?
Yes. As of January 1, 2023, the CPRA’s amendments to the CCPA are in effect, and businesses are required to comply with all express statutory requirements. Businesses are also required to comply with those CCPA regulations currently in effect.
10. Are there any CCPA regulations currently in effect?
Yes. The California Department of Justice promulgated an initial round of regulations implementing the CCPA on August 14, 2020 and further amended on March 15, 2021. Those regulations were recently updated by the California Privacy Protection Agency. These regulations appear in
Title 11, Division 6, Section 7001 et seq. of the California Code of Regulations
and were effective on March 29, 2023.
11. Are the statutory exemptions for employee data and business-to-business transactions still in effect?
No. The exemptions for employment-related personal information and personal information reflecting business-to-business transactions described in Civil Code Sec. 1798.145(m)-(n) expired on December 31, 2022.
12. Can I use an authorized agent to submit a request?
Yes.  You may authorize another person to submit a CCPA request on your behalf.  You may also authorize a business entity registered with the California Secretary of State to submit a request on your behalf.
Please note that if you use an authorized agent, businesses may require more information from either the authorized agent or from you to verify that you are the person directing the agent.  For example, for requests to know or delete your personal information, the business may require the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave that agent signed permission to submit the request.  Businesses may also require you to verify your identity directly with the business or directly confirm with the business that you gave the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

B. RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF SALE OR SHARING
1. What is the right to opt-out?
You may request that businesses stop selling or sharing your personal information (“opt-out”).  Note that sharing refers specifically to sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising, which is the targeting of advertising to a
consumer
based on the
consumer
’s
personal information
obtained from the
consumer
’s online activity across numerous websites. With some exceptions, businesses cannot sell or share your personal information after they receive your opt-out request unless you later provide authorization allowing them to do so again. Businesses must wait at least 12 months before asking you to opt back in to the sale or sharing of your personal information.
2. Can businesses sell a child’s personal information?
Businesses can only sell the personal information of a child that they know to be under the age of 16 if they get affirmative authorization (“opt-in”) for the sale of the child’s personal information. For children under the age of 13, that opt-in must come from the child’s parent or guardian. For children who are at least 13 years old but under the age of 16, the opt-in can come from the child.
3. How do I submit my opt-out request?
Businesses that sell personal information are subject to the CCPA's requirement to provide a clear and conspicuous “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on their website that allows you to submit an opt-out request. Businesses cannot require you to create an account in order to submit your request. Businesses also should not require you to verify your identity, though they can ask you basic questions to identify which personal information is associated with you.
You can also submit an opt-out request via a user-enabled global privacy control, like the GPC, discussed in FAQ 8 & 9 below. If you can’t find a business’s “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link, review its privacy policy to see if it sells or shares personal information. If the business does, it must also include that link in its privacy policy.
If a business’s "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link or other designated method of submitting opt-out requests is not working or difficult to find, you may report the business to our office (
https://oag.ca.gov/contact/consumer-complaint-against-business-or-company
).
4. How long does the business have to respond to my opt-out request?
Businesses must respond as soon as feasibly possible to your request, up to a maximum of 15 business days from the date they received your request to opt-out.
5. Why is the business asking me for more information?
While businesses are not required to verify that the person submitting an opt-out request is really the consumer for whom the business has personal information, they may need to ask you for additional information to make sure they stop selling the right person’s personal information. If the business asks for personal information to verify your identity, it can only use that information for this verification purpose.
6. Why did the business deny my opt-out request?
There are some exceptions to the opt-out right. Common reasons why businesses may refuse to stop selling your personal information include:
Sale or sharing is necessary for the business to comply with legal obligations, exercise legal claims or rights, or defend legal claims
The information is publicly available information, certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA.
See
Civil Code section 1798.145
for more exceptions.
If you do not know why a business denied your opt-out request, follow up with the business to ask it for its reasons.
7. Why did I get a response that the business is a service provider that does not have to act on my request?
Many businesses use other businesses to provide services for them. For example, a retailer may contract with a payment card processor to process customer credit card transactions or a shipping company to deliver orders. These entities may qualify as “service providers” under the CCPA.
The CCPA treats service providers differently than the businesses they serve. It is the business that is responsible for responding to consumer requests.  If you submit a request to opt-out to a service provider of a business instead of the business itself, the service provider may deny the request. You must submit your request to the business itself.
If a service provider has said that it does not or cannot act on your request because it is a service provider, you may follow up to ask who the business is. However, sometimes the service provider will not be able to provide that information. You may be able to determine who the business is based on the services that the service provider provides, although sometimes this may be difficult or impossible.
8. What is the GPC?
Businesses that sell or share personal information must offer two or more methods for consumers to submit requests to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. For businesses that collect personal information from consumers online, one acceptable method for consumers to opt-out of sales or sharing is via a user-enabled global privacy control, like the
GPC
.  Developed in response to the CCPA and to enhance consumer privacy rights, the GPC is a ‘stop selling or sharing my data switch’ that is available on some internet browsers, like Mozilla Firefox, Duck Duck Go, and Brave, or as a browser extension. It is a proposed technical standard that reflects what the CCPA regulations contemplated – some consumers want a comprehensive option that broadly signals their opt-out request, as opposed to making requests on multiple websites on different browsers or devices. Opting out of the sale or sharing of personal information should be easy for consumers, and the GPC is one option for consumers who want to submit requests to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information via a user-enabled global privacy control. Under law, it must be honored by covered businesses as a valid consumer request to stop the sale or sharing of personal information.

https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa/gpc
9. How do I submit my opt-out request using the GPC?
To learn more about the GPC, you can visit its website
here
.  Developers have begun to innovate around the GPC and created different mechanisms for consumers, such as EFF’s
Privacy Badger
extension or the Brave Privacy Browser.

C. REQUESTS TO KNOW
1. What is the right to know?
You may request that businesses disclose to you what personal information they have collected, used, shared, or sold about you, and why they collected, used, shared, or sold that information. Specifically, you may request that businesses disclose:
The categories of personal information collected
Specific pieces of personal information collected
The categories of sources from which the business collected personal information
The purposes for which the business uses the personal information
The categories of third parties with whom the business shares the personal information
The categories of information that the business sells or discloses to third parties
Businesses must provide you this information for the 12-month period preceding your request. They must provide this information to you free of charge.
2. How do I submit my request to know?
Businesses must designate at least two methods for you to submit your request—for example, an email address, website form, or hard copy form. One of those methods has to be a toll-free phone number and, if the business has a website, one of those methods has to be through its website. However, if a business operates exclusively online, it only needs to provide an email address for submitting requests to know.
Businesses cannot make you create an account just to submit a request to know, but if you already have an account with the business, it may require you to submit your request through that account.
Make sure you submit your request to know through one of the business’s designated methods, which may be different from its normal customer service contact information. If you can’t find a business’s designated methods, review its privacy policy, which must include instructions on how you can submit your request.
If a business’s designated method of submitting requests to know is not working, notify the business in writing and consider submitting your request through another designated method if possible.
3. How long does the business have to respond to my request to know?
Businesses must respond to your request within 45 calendar days. They can extend that deadline by another 45 days (90 days total) if they notify you.
If you submitted a request to know and have not received any response within the timeline, check the business’s privacy policy to make sure you submitted your request through the designated way. Follow up with the business to see if the business is subject to the CCPA and to follow up on your request.
4. Why is the business asking me for more information?
Businesses must verify that the person making a request to know is the consumer about whom the business has personal information. Businesses may need to ask you for additional information for verification purposes. If the business asks for personal information to verify your identity, it can only use that information for this verification purpose.
5. Why did the business deny my request to know?
There are some exceptions to the right to know. Common reasons why businesses may refuse to disclose your personal information include:
The business cannot verify your request
The request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or the business has already provided personal information to you more than twice in a 12-month period
Businesses cannot disclose certain sensitive information, such as your social security number, financial account number, or account passwords, but they must tell you if they’re collecting that type of information
Disclosure would restrict the business’s ability to comply with legal obligations, exercise legal claims or rights, or defend legal claims
If the personal information is certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA
See
Civil Code section 1798.145
for more exceptions.
If you do not know why a business denied your request to know, follow up with the business to ask it for its reasons.
6. Why did I get a response that the business is a service provider that does not have to act on my request?
Many businesses use other businesses to provide services for them. For example, a retailer may contract with a payment card processor to process customer credit card transactions or a shipping company to deliver orders. These entities may qualify as “service providers” under the CCPA.

If a service provider has said that it does not or cannot act on your request because it is a service provider, you may follow up to ask who the business is. However, sometimes the service provider will not be able to provide that information. You may be able to determine who the business is based on the services that the service provider provides, although sometimes this may be difficult or impossible.

D. REQUESTS TO DELETE
1. What is my right to delete personal information?
You may request that businesses delete personal information they collected from you and to tell their service providers to do the same. However, there are
many exceptions
(see FAQ D.5) that allow businesses to keep your personal information.
2. How do I submit my right to delete?
Review the business’s privacy policy, which must include instructions on how you can submit your request to delete.
Businesses must designate at least two methods for you to submit your request—for example, a toll-free number, email address, website form, or hard copy form. However, if a business operates exclusively online, it only needs to provide an email address for submitting requests.
Businesses cannot make you create an account just to submit a deletion request, but if you already have an account with the business, it may require you to submit your request through that account.
Make sure you submit your deletion request through one of the business’s designated methods, which may be different from its normal customer service contact information.
If a business’s designated method of submitting requests to delete is not working, notify the business in writing and consider submitting your request through another designated method if possible.
3. How long does the business have to respond to my request to delete?
Businesses must respond to your request within 45 calendar days. They can extend that deadline by another 45 days (90 days total) if they notify you.
If you submitted a request to delete and have not received any response within the timeline, check the business’s privacy policy to make sure you submitted your request through the designated way. Follow up with the business to see if the business is subject to the CCPA and to follow up on your request.
4. Why is the business asking me for more information?
Businesses must verify that the person making a request to delete is the consumer about whom the business has personal information. Businesses may need to ask you for additional information for verification purposes. If the business asks for personal information to verify your identity, it can only use that information for this verification purpose.
5. Why did the business deny my request to delete?
There are exceptions to the right to delete. Common reasons why businesses may keep your personal information include:
If the information is exempt from the CCPA.  This includes:
Publicly available information (such as your address, which is often in public real estate/property records)
.  However, if you are a law enforcement officer, public official, or Safe at Home participant (available to victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, elder and dependent abuse, as well as reproductive health workers), you may request a website to not publicly post your address as described
here
.
Certain
types of information
such as medical information or consumer credit reporting information.
The business cannot verify your request
To complete your transaction, provide a reasonably anticipated product or service, or for certain warranty and product recall purposes
For certain business security practices
For certain internal uses that are compatible with reasonable consumer expectations or the context in which the information was provided
To comply with legal obligations, exercise legal claims or rights, or defend legal claims
If the personal information is certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA
See
Civil Code sections 1798.105(d)
and
1798.145
for more exceptions.
If you do not know why a business denied your request to delete, follow up with the business to ask it for its reasons.
6. Why did I get a response that the business is a service provider that does not have to act on my request?
Many businesses use other businesses to provide services for them. For example, a retailer may contract with a payment card processor to process customer credit card transactions or a shipping company to deliver orders. These entities may qualify as “service providers” under the CCPA.
The CCPA treats service providers differently than the businesses they serve. It is the business that is responsible for responding to consumer requests.  If you submit a request to delete to a service provider of a business instead of the business itself, the service provider may deny the request. You must submit your request to the business itself.
If a service provider has said that it does not or cannot act on your request because it is a service provider, you may follow up to ask who the business is. However, sometimes the service provider will not be able to provide that information. You may be able to determine who the business is based on the services that the service provider provides, although sometimes this may be difficult or impossible.
7. Why is a debt collector still calling me about my debt even though I asked it to delete my information?
Creditors, collection agencies, and other debt collectors can still try to collect debts that you owe even if you asked them to delete your personal information. Learn more about debt collectors—including what they can and can’t do—

E. REQUESTS TO CORRECT 
 (RIGHT TO CORRECT)
1. What is the right to correct?
You may ask businesses to correct inaccurate information that they have about you.
The California Privacy Protection Agency is currently engaged in a formal rulemaking process and has
proposed CCPA regulations pertaining to the right to correct
, but these are not currently final or effective.
2.  How do I submit my request to correct?
Review the business’s privacy policy, which should include instructions on how you can submit your request to correct.
Businesses must designate at least two methods for you to submit your request—for example, a toll-free number, email address, website form, or hard copy form. However, if a business operates exclusively online, it only needs to provide an email address for submitting requests.
Businesses cannot make you create an account just to submit a correction request, but if you already have an account with the business, it may require you to submit your request through that account.
Make sure you submit your correction request through one of the business’s designated methods, which may be different from its normal customer service contact information.
If a business’s designated method of submitting requests to correct is not working, notify the business in writing and consider submitting your request through another designated method if possible.
3. How long does the business have to respond to my request to correct?
Businesses must respond to your request within 45 calendar days. They can extend that deadline by another 45 days (90 days total) if they notify you.
If you submitted a request to correct and have not received any response within the timeline, check the business’s privacy policy to make sure you submitted your request through the designated way. Follow up with the business to see if the business is subject to the CCPA and to follow up on your request.
4. Why is the business asking me for more information?
Businesses must verify that the person making a request to correct is the consumer about whom the business has personal information. Businesses may need to ask you for additional information for verification purposes. If the business asks for personal information to verify your identity, it can only use that information for this verification purpose.
5. Why did the business deny my request to correct?
There are exceptions to the right to correct. Common reasons why businesses may deny your request to correct include:
The business cannot verify your identity to complete your request
The request is manifestly unfounded or excessive
The information is publicly available information, certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA
If you do not know why a business denied your request to correct, follow up with the business to ask it for its reasons.

F. REQUESTS TO LIMIT USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION (RIGHT TO LIMIT)
1. What is the right to limit?
You can direct businesses to only use your sensitive personal information (for example, your social security number, financial account information, your precise geolocation data, or your genetic data) for limited purposes, such as providing you with the services you requested.
The California Privacy Protection Agency is currently engaged in a formal rulemaking process and has
proposed CCPA regulations pertaining to the right to limit
, but these are not currently final or effective.

G. RIGHT TO NON-DISCRIMINATION
Businesses cannot deny goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your rights under the CCPA.
However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to a business or ask it to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for the business to provide you with goods or services, the business may not be able to complete that transaction.
Businesses can also offer you promotions, discounts and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information. But they can only do this if the financial incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your personal information. If you ask a business to delete or stop selling your personal information, you may not be able to continue participating in the special deals they offer in exchange for personal information. If you are not sure how your request may affect your participation in a special offer, ask the business.

H. REQUIRED NOTICES
1. What is a notice at collection?
The CCPA requires businesses to give consumers certain information in a “notice at collection.” A notice at collection must list the categories of personal information businesses collect about consumers and the purposes for which they use the categories of information. (To find out how you can learn what specific information a business has collected about you, see the
Right to Know section
.)  If the business sells consumers’ personal information, then the notice at collection must include a
Do Not Sell or Share link
. The notice must also contain a link to the business’s privacy policy, where consumers can get a fuller description of the business’s privacy practices and of their privacy rights.
2. Where can I find a business’s notice at collection?
This notice must be provided
at or before
the point at which the business collects your personal information. For example, you might find a link to the notice at collection on a website’s homepage and on a webpage where you place an order or enter your personal information for another reason. On a mobile app, you might find a link to the notice in the settings menu. In a retail store, you might find the notice on a printed form used to collect your personal information.
3. What is a privacy policy?
A business’s privacy policy is a written statement that gives a broad picture of its online and offline practices for the collection, use, sharing, and sale of consumers’ personal information. The CCPA requires business privacy policies to include information on consumers’ privacy rights and how to exercise them: the
Right to Know
, the
Right to Delete
, the
Right to Opt-Out of Sale
, the
the Right to Correct
, the
the Right to Limit
, and the
Right to Non-Discrimination
.
4. Where can I find a business’s privacy policy?
Most businesses post their privacy policy on their websites. A link to it can usually be found at the bottom of the homepage and other webpages. The link’s title may include “Privacy” or “California Privacy Rights.” In a mobile app, the privacy policy may be linked on the download page for the app or in the app’s settings menu.

I. DATA BROKERS AND THE CCPA
1. What is a data broker?
Another California law,
Civil Code section 1798.99.80
, defines a data broker as “a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.” This law exempts certain businesses that are regulated by other laws from this definition. Exempted businesses include consumer reporting agencies (commonly known as credit bureaus) and certain financial institutions and insurance companies.
Data brokers collect information about consumers from many sources including websites, other businesses, and public records. The data broker analyzes and packages the data for sale to other businesses.
2. How can I find data brokers that collect and sell my personal information?
The
California law on data brokers
requires data brokers covered by the law to register with the Attorney General and to provide certain information on their practices. The Data Broker Registry can be found on the Attorney General’s website at
https://oag.ca.gov/data-brokers
.
Data brokers are subject to the CCPA. On the Data Broker Registry website, you will find contact information and a website link for each registered data broker, as well as additional information to help you exercise your CCPA rights.
3. How can I stop a data broker from selling my personal information?
You can click on the “View Full Submission” link on the
Data Broker Registry
to get instructions on how to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. However, you may not be able to stop the sale of all of your information. The CCPA’s definition of “personal information” does not include information lawfully made available from government records, which are often sources used by data brokers.
You can also go to a data broker’s website through the link posted on the Registry and find the broker’s privacy policy to learn more about its privacy practices and how to exercise your CCPA rights.
