About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls

Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers

Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.

similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.

the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

YouTube API Services - Developer Policies
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note:
Complying with the YouTube Developer Policies
provides guidance and examples to help you ensure that your API clients follow specific portions of the YouTube API Services
Terms
and
Policies
(API TOS). The guide offers insight into how YouTube enforces certain aspects of the API TOS, but it does not replace any existing documents.
This document (the "
YouTube API Services Policies
" or "
Policies
") sets out the policies that you need to follow when accessing or using
YouTube API Services
in your service, product, or application. These Policies help you access and use
YouTube API Services
in ways that are consistent with YouTube's interests and that respect and foster the growth of YouTube's community of creators, viewers, content rights holders, and advertisers.
In addition to defining policies, this document explains some of the underlying principles that YouTube followed in creating these Policies. It also offers examples that demonstrate how these Policies would apply in practice.
Please note that this is a legal document and that these Policies are a component of the
Agreement
, so you must comply with them. YouTube reserves the right to change these Policies, and your continued access to, or use of,
YouTube API Services
constitutes your agreement to and acceptance of any such changes. Policy changes, like changes to the YouTube API Services
Terms of Service
, will be documented in the
Terms of Service Revision History
, and you can subscribe to the
RSS feed
for that revision history to be notified of any such changes.
I. Terminology and style
This is a legal document that specifies policies about allowed or prohibited actions. As such, it uses certain terms to specifically indicate whether you can or cannot do something. With that in mind, the following terms are used to explain your requirements as related to these Policies:
The terms
must
and required refer to absolute requirements.
The term
must not
refers to an absolute prohibition.
The terms
should
,
should not
,
recommend
, and
recommended
indicate that the statement describes a general best practice. While these terms suggest certain actions or behaviors, they acknowledge that you might decide to follow a different course based on specific aspects of your use case.
The term
may
indicates that an action is optional and left entirely to your discretion or, depending on the context in which it is used, to YouTube's discretion.
In addition, the
Definitions
section that concludes this document identifies other terms that have a very specific meaning when used in this document. For your convenience, this document uses a special style for those terms to so that you can easily identify them in context and link to their definitions.
II. Software Development Principles
These principles underlie many of the policies in this document. Even though they might not cover every policy, if you violate or your
API Clients
violate any of these principles, you are likely also violating the terms of the
Agreement
. That said, if local law requires you to do something other than what is stated in these policies -- for example, to store data for a particular length of time -- you should comply with that law.
Build high-quality applications and maintain them.
Build stable, easy-to-use, feature-rich
API Clients
that bring significant additional value to the YouTube ecosystem and its users. Promptly update
API Clients
as the features offered in
YouTube API Services
change.
Be honest and transparent.
This principle applies to all facets of
API Clients
and the way that they interact with users as well as with YouTube. In keeping with this principle, be clear about who you are and what your
API Client
does. Don't engage in any deceptive activity or messaging related to your identity, your data collection, storage, sharing, use and deletion practices, actions that your
API Client
takes on users' behalf, or anything else. Be honest and do not mislead or confuse users in the way you use and present data.
Give users control.
Building on the importance of transparency, this principle dictates that users must be aware of and have actively consented to the actions that an
API Client
takes on their behalf. It means that users know about and have final authority over any actions the
API Client
takes to insert, share, update, or delete their data. It also means that each
API Client
must provide a privacy policy that clearly informs users about the information that the
API Client
accesses, collects, stores, shares, and otherwise uses.
Respect users' privacy.
Make sure that your data collection, storage, use, security, and deletion policies and practices protect users. Don't allow unauthorized access to, or use of, user data. Don't store user data indefinitely, and provide a clear, straightforward process for them to delete data in your possession. Finally, don’t, and do not make attempts to, request, collect, or store users' YouTube login credentials.
Be a good citizen.
Don't create
API Clients
that encourage or enable people to abuse, threaten, or harass each other. Don't use, distribute, or promote viruses, spyware, malware, or other bad stuff. Don't break the law or encourage or enable others to do so. Hopefully, this is all common sense.
III. General Developer Policies
A. API Client Terms of Use and Privacy Policies
API Clients
must display a link to YouTube's Terms of Service (
https://www.youtube.com/t/terms
), and they must also state in their own terms of use that, by using those
API Clients
, users are agreeing to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service.
Each
API Client
must require users to agree to a privacy policy before users can access the
API Client's
features and functionality. The privacy policy must:
be prominently displayed and easily accessible to users at all times,
notify users that the
API Client
uses
YouTube API Services
,
reference and link to the Google Privacy Policy at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy,
clearly and comprehensively explain to users what user information, including
API Data
relating to users, the
API Client
accesses, collects, stores and otherwise uses,
clearly and comprehensively explain how the
API Client
uses, processes, and shares the user information described in section (III.A.2.e), including how the information is shared with either internal or external parties,
disclose, if it does so, that the
API Client
allows third parties to serve content, including advertisements,
disclose, if it does so, that the
API Client
stores, accesses or collects (or allows third parties to do so) information directly or indirectly on or from users’ devices, including by placing, accessing or recognizing cookies or similar technology on users' devices or browsers,
if the
API Client
accesses or uses
Authorized Data
, explain that, in addition to the
API Client's
normal procedure for deleting stored data, users can revoke that
API Client's
access to their data via the Google security settings page at
https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions
, and
if the
API Client
uses
Authorized Data
, explain how users can contact the
API Client
owner or developer with questions or complaints about the
Client's
privacy practices.
B. Maintainability and Deprecation
API Clients
must use the most recent versions of
YouTube API Services
. This means that you must be able to update
API Clients
when newer versions of
YouTube API Services
are released. Non-website
API Clients
, like mobile apps or installed applications, must be capable of being remotely updated to use the most recent versions of
YouTube API Services
. You must update your
API Clients
to the most recent versions of the
YouTube API Services
within a specified time period if required by YouTube from time to time (e.g. for critical updates).
When YouTube intends to make backward incompatible changes to the
YouTube API Services
, such changes will be documented in the
Terms of Service Revision History
, and you can subscribe to the
RSS feed
for that revision history to be notified of any such changes.
You must promptly update non-deprecated
API Clients
to use newer versions of
YouTube API Services
as those versions are released.
You must update deprecated versions of your
API Clients
to clearly indicate to users that some functions or features of
YouTube API Services
might stop working due to the
API Clients'
deprecated status.
C. Implementing YouTube Features
API Clients
must also comply with the
Requirements for Minimum Functionality for YouTube API Services
("
RMF
"). In addition,
API Clients
must not place any limitations on the YouTube functionality required by the RMF.
For example, the RMF states that an
API Client
that enables users to upload videos to YouTube must enable those users to set a title for each uploaded video. YouTube's video title field has a maximum length of 100 characters, and an
API Client
must not set a shorter maximum length for that field.
Any
API Client
feature that initiates a user action related to a YouTube resource must be:
clearly and unequivocally identifiable as a YouTube action,
distinct and not mixed with your
API Client's
functionality, and
clearly initiated by the user.
Examples of YouTube resources include videos, channels, playlists, playlist items, and subscriptions. Examples of actions include playing a video, liking a video, adding a video to a playlist, and subscribing to a channel.
API Clients
that perform write operations may suggest parameter or property values, but users must have final control over the data that will be published to
YouTube Applications
. Similarly,
API Clients
must not modify user-provided values before sending them to YouTube by truncating, appending, or otherwise altering those values unless the user has explicitly consented to such changes.
API Clients
that suggest values for text fields, like video titles or descriptions, must incorporate relevant keywords into those values. For example an
API Client
that suggests video titles should not generate the same default titles for all users.
These examples illustrate how this policy would apply to an
API Client
that uploads videos to YouTube:
The
API Client
may suggest a video description or pre-populate the video description. However, it must not add information to the video description after it is submitted by the user and before it is sent without the user's prior consent. For example, the
API Client
must not append the recording date,
API Client
name, or any other text unless the user has explicitly consented to such changes.
An
API Client
may provide an option to translate a video title to other languages. However, the
API Client
must not add any such translations without the user's consent. In addition, if the
API Client's
default behavior is to enable the option to translate the video title, it must clearly present to the user an easy way to disable that behavior.
API Clients
must clearly indicate how user-provided data will be used on YouTube.
This policy is particularly relevant for
API Clients
that interface with multiple services and platforms since there may be functional or labeling differences between those services and platforms.
For example, an
API Client
enables users to add comments about videos to multiple platforms, including YouTube. Each platform uses a different name to refer to the comment text. So, if the
API Client
labels the field "Feedback" in its comment form, it needs to clearly indicate that that value corresponds to the comment text on YouTube.
API Clients
that use search functionality provided by
YouTube API Services
must not modify or replace the text, images, information, or other content of, the search results returned by those Services.
For example,
API Clients
must not merge or intermix results from sources other than YouTube and present them as YouTube search results.
An
API Client
should not limit or reduce the functionality of a YouTube feature unless that limitation is a core aspect (as described in the examples below) of the
API Client
itself and that YouTube feature is not required by the RMF ("
Permitted Feature Limitation
").
Example 1: Permitted Feature Limitation
The YouTube Data API service allows a video uploader to provide translations of a video's title. Generally speaking, an
API Client
that implements this feature should allow uploaders to translate video titles to any language that YouTube supports. However, an
API Client
that is specifically designed to teach users to speak French and that offers a range of features specific to French translations might be justified in only offering users the option to upload French translations of video titles.
Example 2: Non-permitted Feature Limitation
A second
API Client
supports video uploading to YouTube and two other platforms, and all of those platforms allow the uploader to provide translations of the video's title. However, while YouTube supports more than 70 languages, the other two platforms each support half that number, and the three platforms support 25 languages in common. If the
API Client
supports only those 25 languages for translation, then that is a non-permitted feature limitation because the limited set of language options is not a core aspect of the
API Client
. Instead, the
API Client
must offer the full range of languages that YouTube supports.
API Clients
with Permitted Feature Limitations must explain to users why each limitation is in place and make clear that the limitation is not imposed by YouTube. In many, if not all, cases, there are different ways that an
API Client
could provide that information, and you should choose an appropriate method for your
API Client
. Within this explanation, an
API Client
should provide a mechanism for users to access the full feature (such as linking to YouTube Creator Studio or providing an expandable menu within the API Client).
In the example 1 above, the
API Client
could explain that video uploaders can add translations for other languages in the YouTube Creator Studio and provide a link to that functionality.
API Clients
that offer features sourced from multiple services and platforms should offer feature parity to the extent that it exists across those sources, providing user choice. When
API Clients
include features that are supported on YouTube and on other platforms,
API Clients
must not consistently present YouTube features in a detrimental way (e.g., by only providing those features from other platforms).
For example, suppose an
API Client
allows users to upload videos to YouTube and three other platforms, and all of those platforms support the ability to upload captions. If the
API Client
also supports caption uploading, then it must support that feature for YouTube.
D. Accessing YouTube API Services
API Credentials
To access or use some
YouTube API Services
, you must first use the
Google Developers Console
(
https://console.cloud.google.com/
) to create
API Credentials
for your
API Project
. Those credentials enable Google and YouTube to link API activity to a particular
API Project
and
API Client
.
In addition to creating
API Credentials
, the Developers Console might require you to provide certain other information, such as identification or contact details, before you can access or use the
YouTube API Services
associated with those credentials. YouTube reserves the right to require you to provide additional information to continue to access or use
YouTube API Services
.
If you need to create
API Credentials
to access or use a specific YouTube API service, the documentation for that service explains how to create those credentials. For example, the
YouTube Data API service
,
YouTube Reporting API service
, and
YouTube Analytics API service
all document steps for creating
API Credentials
. Those steps generally differ slightly from one API service to another. For example:
Some services only support authorized API requests, while others support authorized and non-authorized requests.
Services often support multiple access scopes. Each scope specifies the resources that an
API Client
can retrieve, insert, update, or delete on the user's behalf. Scopes enable
API Clients
to only request access to the resources they need, and scopes also enable users to control the amount of access that they grant to those Clients.
The following policies also apply to access and use of
YouTube API Services
:
You must not mask or misrepresent your identity or your
API Client's
identity when accessing or using
YouTube API Services
or when creating an
API Project
or
API Credentials
.
You must only use
API Credentials
assigned to you and to your
API Project
to access
YouTube API Services
. Similarly, you must not use any other means to mask or misrepresent your
API Client's
access to, or usage of,
YouTube API Services
.
If your
API Client
needs to create
API Credentials
to access or use
YouTube API Services
, you must create exactly one (1)
API Project
for that
API Client
. Those
API Credentials
are intended to be used exclusively by the associated API Client, which means that you must not use that one (1)
API Project
for multiple
API Clients
.
You may share your
API Credentials
with agents operating solely on your behalf and under a written duty of confidentiality. However, you must not share or disclose your
API Credentials
to any other third party, allow access to or use of your
API Credentials
by any other third party, or embed your
API Credentials
in open source projects.
User Authentication and Authorization
Authentication and authorization refer to the process by which users identify themselves and consent to allow an
API Client
to access certain user-specific data. Some
YouTube API Services
do not support access to user-specific data and therefore, do not require any authorization, others require authorization for some requests or data, and still others require authorization for all requests. For example:
The YouTube IFrame Player API service, which lets you embed videos in a website, does not require authorization just as users do not need to log in to the YouTube website to watch a video.
The YouTube Data API service requires authorization for some actions. For example, an
API Client
can search for public videos but does not need user authorization to do so. However, an
API Client
does need user authorization to upload a video to the user's YouTube channel.
The YouTube Analytics API service and YouTube Reporting API service require authorization for all actions.
Authentication
API Clients
must not (and must not attempt to) obtain, proxy, request, collect, modify, cache, store, or use any information that the user provides or that YouTube displays to the user during authentication processes, including YouTube user account login credentials like usernames and passwords.
API Clients
must obtain user consent in accordance with the applicable laws and only request access to authorization scopes that they currently use. The access that an
API Client
requests should have a direct and transparent benefit to users of that Client. Do not try to future-proof your access to data by asking for permissions that would enable features that you have not yet built.
For example, the YouTube Data API service supports one authorization scope that grants access to read data and another that grants access to read and write data. If a user granted an
API Client
access to the first scope, that
API Client
would be able to retrieve information about the current user's YouTube channel. However, if a user granted the
API Client
access to the second scope, the
API Client
could also upload a video to that channel.
In this scenario, an
API Client
that does not support YouTube uploads (or other write-based actions) only needs to request access to the first authorization scope, which is more limited in the privileges it grants. Even if the
API Client's
developer plans to eventually introduce support for write-based actions, the developer cannot future-proof the
API Client
by requesting access to the authorization scope for writing data before the
Client
actually supports features that require that scope.
API Clients
should request access to authorization scopes in context whenever possible. By requesting access to user data in context, via incremental authorization, an
API Client
enables users to more easily understand why it needs access to that data.
API Client Identification and Representation
API Clients
must clearly and accurately identify to the user the entity or product that is requesting access to user data and the reason for requesting that access;
API Clients
must not mislead users when requesting access to data so that users can make an informed decision about whether to grant access to those Clients. Users should be able to readily understand both the value of providing the data that an
API Client
requests access to and the consequences of sharing that data.
API Clients
must clearly and comprehensively identify to users the purposes for which they access and use user data.
API Clients
must not use user data for secondary purposes that are not clearly disclosed to users.
Users should not be surprised to learn that an
API Client
contains hidden features, services, or actions that are inconsistent with the
Client's
marketed purposes.
Revocation
Every
API Client
must provide a clearly explained and easy way for users to revoke any authorization consent they have provided to an
API Client
to access
YouTube API Services
.
When a user revokes consent through this mechanism, the
API Client
must programmatically revoke that token right away to communicate the change in permissions to Google. For example, an
API Client
could use a Google API Client Library to revoke the token.
In addition, following revocation of consent through this mechanism, you and your
API Clients
must delete all
Authorized Data
that was accessed or stored pursuant to that consent. That deletion should happen as soon as possible and must take place within 7 calendar days of the revocation.
As noted in section (III.A.2.i), every
API Client
must include in its Privacy Policy a link to Google's security settings page (
https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions
). When a user revokes consent through that page, you and your
API Clients
must also delete all
API Data
related to that user that was accessed or stored pursuant to such consent. To comply with this policy, your
API Clients
will need to periodically reconfirm that its authorization tokens are still valid and delete
API Data
associated with users whose authorization tokens cannot be refreshed.
Based on the requirements defined in section (III.E.4) regarding stored data, all such deletions should happen as soon as possible and must take place within 30 calendar days of that revocation.
Usage and Quotas
YouTube may use quotas and place use restrictions to ensure that
YouTube API Services
are accessed and used as intended and that you and your
API Clients
do not reduce service quality or limit access for others.
If your
API Client
reaches the quota limit for a service,
      you can apply for a quota extension by completing an
API Compliance Audit
where you must specify the use case for which you need the extension.
      If you have been audited in the past 12 months and have been marked compliant by YouTube API Services team, you can apply for an
additional quota extension
.
If YouTube approves the application, you must use the additional quota granted only for the approved use case. If your
API Client's
use case changes, to use any allocated quota for the new use case, you must notify YouTube of the change by resubmitting an
API Compliance Audit
and receive approval for the application.
If YouTube rejects the application, you can
file an appeal
.
Inactivity
YouTube reserves the right to disable or curtail your access to, or use of, specific
YouTube API Services
if your
API Project
has been inactive for 90 consecutive days. For example, YouTube could revoke your
API Credentials
, or reduce (or eliminate) your
API Project's
quotas for specific
YouTube API Services
. If your
API Client's
quota is reduced or eliminated, you may reapply for quota or a quota extension, and YouTube will review that application based on YouTube’s determination of your expected use of the
YouTube API Services
.
Contact Information
YouTube’s primary means of contacting you about your
API Project
or
API Client
is the email address that is associated with the Google Account that you use to log in to the Google Developers Console. You must comply to any communication that YouTube sends you regarding compliance issues relating to your
API Clients
.
If users of your
API Client
have questions about your privacy practices, and you do not have a contact address in your
API Client's
privacy policy as discussed in section (A.2.i), YouTube may share your primary email address with those users.
Prohibited Access
You are prohibited from accessing or attempting to access
YouTube API Services
via any means if your
API Credentials
are suspended, revoked, or terminated, or if the Google Account you used to create those credentials is suspended or terminated, for any reason. In that case, you must not access or attempt to access
YouTube API Services
via any means, including by creating or using a proxy to create new Google Accounts,
API Credentials
or
API Projects
.
Undocumented Services
You must not use undocumented APIs without express permission. You must access data from YouTube API services only according to the means stipulated in the authorized documentation of that YouTube API service.
You must not reverse engineer undocumented YouTube API services or otherwise attempt to derive the underlying source code of these API services.
E. Handling YouTube Data and Content
Aside from the permissions and rights granted in this section, you and your
API Clients
have no further permissions or rights to
API Data
, including to temporarily stored
API Data
.
Audiovisual Content
You and your
API Clients
must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to:
download, import, backup, cache, or store copies of YouTube audiovisual content without YouTube's prior written approval,
make content available for offline playback, or
use any aspect of the
YouTube API Services
to facilitate or promote copyright infringement or the exploitation of copyright-infringing materials.
Data Aggregation
Do not aggregate
API Data
except that you may only aggregate
API Data
relating to YouTube channels that are under the same content owner as recognized by YouTube pursuant to content licensing agreement(s) between YouTube and such content owner. Such aggregated
API Data
must only be viewable by that content owner.
Do not aggregate
API Data
or otherwise use
API Data
or
YouTube API Services
to gain insights into YouTube's usage, revenue, or any other aspects of YouTube's business.
For example, suppose that two different content owners recognized by YouTube have each authorized an
API Client
to retrieve
API Data
on their behalf for their respective viewing. That
API Client
may separately aggregate
API Data
retrieved for each content owner's channels provided that such aggregation per content owner does not provide insights into YouTube’s usage, revenue or any other aspects of YouTube’s business. The
API Client
must not combine
API Data
from the different content owners.
Authorized Data Usage
These policies relate to your use of
Authorized Data
. They are relevant for any
API Client
that writes data via an API request or retrieves data that can only be accessed via a properly authorized API request. For example, these policies apply to any
API Client
that enables a user to upload videos, retrieve the user's list of uploaded videos, create playlists, or comment on videos.
API Clients
must be honest and transparent about the types of user data and the purposes for which they collect, store, delete, share, safeguard, and otherwise use that data.
API Clients
must not display or allow access to
Authorized Data
to anyone other than the authorizing user or agents expressly approved by that user.
API Clients
must only access, collect and use
Authorized Data
in accordance with the scope of its privacy policy and user consent obtained in accordance with Section 2.
This means that an
API Client
must prompt users to re-accept its privacy policy if the
Client
starts to access, collect, or use
API Data
in a way or for purposes that were not covered in the privacy policy that the user originally accepted.
API Clients
must clearly identify any actions that they take to insert, share, update, or delete data or content on the authorizing user's behalf. In addition, the user must expressly consent to those actions prior to their actual execution.
API Clients
must clearly identify the YouTube channel or content owner that is associated with any request that requires user authorization.
API Clients
must clearly identify any content visibility settings that will be set or modified by any authorized user action. In addition,
API Clients
must not modify existing content visibility settings unless the authorizing user has expressly instructed the
API Clients
to do so.
For example, in the YouTube Data API service, a video's privacy status can be set to
public
,
private
, or
unlisted
. If an
API Client
supports video uploads, the
Client
must clearly display an option for the user to choose one of those values. Similarly, if an
API Client
supports edits to a video's metadata, the
API Client
cannot change a video's privacy status without the user's express consent.
Refreshing, Storing, and Displaying API Data
Developers often need to balance the benefits of storing or caching data, such as improved performance or resource usage, with the desire to always retrieve the freshest data, which provides the best user experience possible. With that in mind, the following policies explain your requirements as well as your options in terms of storing, updating, and displaying YouTube
API Data
.
API Clients
may store authorization tokens for as long as is necessary provided that those tokens are used only for purposes consistent with the specific consent granted by an active user according to the applicable law.
API Clients
may store the following types of
Authorized Data
for as long as is necessary provided that the data is used for purposes consistent with the specific consent granted by an active user according to the applicable laws:
data retrieved through the YouTube Analytics API service,
data provided through the YouTube Reporting API service, or
statistics provided through other YouTube API services, such as the number of views for a video, the number of channels for a subscriber, or the number of videos in a playlist. (All of those statistics can be retrieved via the YouTube Data API service.)
Note that even though an
API Client
may store this data for more than 30 days, the
Client
must still ensure every 30 days that it is still authorized by the user to access that data.
For example, an
API Client
may store view counts for a video for more than 30 days, but it must still verify every 30 days that its authorization to access the video uploader's data has not been revoked. The
API Client
must also verify, every 30 days, that the video has not been deleted.
To be clear, an
API Client
must not store statistics retrieved as
Non-Authorized Data
for more than 30 days. For example, an
API Client
must not store the subscriber count for a YouTube channel for more than 30 days without authorization from the channel owner.
API Clients
may store all other types of
Authorized Data
not identified in section (III.E.4.b) for as long as is necessary for the purposes of the specific consent granted by an active user and for no longer than 30 calendar days. After 30 calendar days, the
API Client
must either delete or refresh the stored data.
API Clients
may temporarily store limited amounts of
Non-Authorized Data
for as long as is necessary for the purposes of the
API Client
but not longer than 30 calendar days. As in section (III.E.4.c) immediately above, this means that after 30 calendar days, the
API Client
must either delete or refresh the stored data.
In all cases,
API Clients
must use reasonable efforts to ensure that their stored
API Data
is consistent with the current data available through
YouTube API Services
. For example,
API Clients
should reflect metadata changes and viewcount updates as quickly as possible.
API Clients
must display the most updated
API Data
available in their user-facing presentations, including in user interfaces, although
API Clients
may display historical
API Data
provided that it is presented accurately in context of time.
Your
API Clients
that access or use user data must provide a way for a user to request that you delete stored data related to that user. For example, your
API Client
could display a button to delete stored data. If the user indicates that you should delete that data, you must then delete it as soon as possible and within 7 calendar days.
The method for deleting stored data must make clear that deleting the data stored by the
API Client
does not, in any way, affect data stored by YouTube and that to delete data on YouTube, the user needs to use a YouTube Application or an authorized
API Client
that supports the ability to delete that data.
Similarly,
API Clients
must respect any other means by which a user expresses an intent to prevent those Clients from accessing user data related to that user. For example, if a user deletes his account from your API Client, you must also delete any user data you have stored related to that user as soon as possible and within 7 calendar days.
Your
API Clients
must not (i) replace
API Data
with similar, independently calculated data, or (ii) access or use
API Data
to create new or derived data or metrics.  To the extent your
API Clients
display any information, data or metrics not based on
API Data
alongside
API Data
, your
API Clients
must include a clear and prominent disclosure there that such information, data and metrics are not from YouTube and are part of your own product.
For example, when displaying the number of likes for a video, your
API Client
must use the number returned in the
API Data
. You must not substitute a different number to represent likes, such as the number of users of your
API Client
that liked the video. Similarly, you are not permitted to use the number of likes returned in the
API Data
to calculate other metrics, such as the percentage of total likes that were made through your
API Client
or a score that factors in likes, total views, or any other
API Data
. However, you are permitted, for example, to display the number of likes that were made through your
API Client
as long as that number is displayed alongside the total likes returned in the
API Data
and as long as your
API Client
clearly communicates that the
API Client
calculates the additional metric independently of YouTube
API Data
.
When your
API Client
loads, it
          collects and shares some basic user data with YouTube via the YouTube embedded player to
          render the video thumbnail and title, determine playability and content restrictions, and
          for fraud and abuse reasons. Additional data is collected and shared by your
API Client
upon video playback
          to customize the player on your
API Client
and third party sites and apps. Remember that if you enable Autoplay, playback will occur
          without any user interaction with the player; playback data collection and sharing will
          therefore occur upon page load. You can limit the data shared with YouTube before a user
          interacts with the YouTube embedded player by setting Autoplay to
false
. As
          noted in the
YouTube API Services
          Terms of Service
, you and your
API Clients
must comply with all
          applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations.
API Clients
must look up the Made
          For Kids status of each YouTube video that it embeds on its site or app by following the
          instructions in
this guide
. For
          each video that is designated Made For Kids,
API Clients
must turn off
          tracking and make sure that all data collection with respect to that player is compliant
          with applicable law(s) including the U.S. Children's Online Privacy (COPPA) and E.U.
          General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)). See the
YouTube Help Center
for
      more information on determining content as Made for Kids.
Security
You and your
API Client
must:
maintain appropriate administrative, organisational, technical, and physical controls to ensure the privacy, security, and confidentiality of user data and
API Data
;
use only industry-standard transport encryption;
protect
API Data
and any other data used in your
API Client
from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
Scraping
You and your
API Clients
must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to, directly or indirectly, scrape
YouTube Applications
or
Google Applications
, or obtain scraped YouTube data or content. Public search engines may scrape data only in accordance with YouTube's robots.txt file or with YouTube's prior written permission.
F. User Experience
YouTube Look and Feel
Innovative user experiences and user interface designs are among the most valuable contributions that
API Clients
can provide to the YouTube community. That said, YouTube's designers and engineers put a lot of thought into designing
YouTube Applications
to ensure that those Applications provide a great user experience.
Taking both of those points into account, your
API Clients
must not change or interfere with user interfaces in
YouTube Applications
unless you have obtained YouTube's prior written approval. You can request that approval at
this form
.
Branding
Any
API Client
page or feature that displays YouTube content – including, without limitation, search results, YouTube videos, channels, playlists, thumbnails, and YouTube players – must make clear to the viewer that YouTube is the source of the relevant content by displaying
YouTube Brand Features
in accordance with the requirements below and the YouTube Branding Guidelines (
https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/branding-guidelines
).
In some cases, an
API Client
might need to display
YouTube Brand Features
next to multiple individual content elements to make the attribution clear to the viewer. For example, an
API Client
that displays search results from YouTube and from other sources on the same page needs to clearly identify YouTube as the source of only the search results from YouTube, including text, images, and other information pertaining to YouTube search results. The
API Client
cannot provide one general set of attribution for all search results from various sources.
Content that does not originate from YouTube must not be shown in a way that suggests that the content is originating from YouTube or in a way that can cause confusion as to the origin of that content.
You and your
API Clients
must not, and must not encourage, enable or require others to, directly or indirectly, interfere with or obscure any attribution provided by YouTube, including attribution provided via or shown in embedded YouTube players. Your
API Clients
must display applicable
YouTube Brand Features
and any other YouTube-provided attribution on all types of devices.
Playback Integrity
Playback integrity refers to the ability to determine and measure how content and ads are served, how video playback is initiated and implemented, and how users interact with YouTube features in your
API Client
. Playback integrity is critical to the YouTube platform, as it helps protect creators' interests, including their ability to monetize their content and develop their audience.
YouTube believes that playback integrity is contingent on a user choosing to watch a video, and
API Clients
are prohibited from providing incentives for watching videos as follows:
API Clients
must not charge users to watch content in an embedded YouTube player.
API Clients
must not otherwise gate access to a video by requiring a user to take an action other than clicking the play button to view or continue playing YouTube audiovisual content. For example,
API Clients
must not require a user to subscribe to a channel or like a video to continue watching YouTube audiovisual content.
For clarity, if your
API Client's
normal functionality requires a certain action that is not specific to
YouTube API Services
, such as login or age verification, that functionality is allowed.
API Clients
must not offer or provide incentives, rewards, or other compensation to users for engaging with
YouTube Applications
(directly or indirectly) by performing actions like viewing content, liking content, sharing content, subscribing to channels, adding comments. For example,
API Clients
must not offer features or services that trade video views for a fee or that trade video views in return for other YouTube-related or non-YouTube-related actions.
G. Distribution and Commercial Use
You may distribute or sell
API Clients
subject to the restrictions defined in the "Prohibited Actions" subsection below and, of course, to the other terms of the
Agreement
.
In addition, you may distribute and display YouTube audiovisual content and accompanying metadata to users through your
API Clients
as long as those Clients comply with the
Agreement
and, specifically, do not engage in any of the prohibited actions listed immediately below.
Prohibited Actions
For specific policies in the following list that require YouTube's prior written approval, you can request that approval at
this form
.
You and your
API Clients
must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to:
sell, purchase, lease, lend, convey, redistribute, or sublicense all or any portion of
YouTube API Services
, including YouTube audiovisual content;
sell
YouTube API Services
or access to any components of
YouTube API Services
unless you obtain YouTube's prior written approval;
sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions that are placed on or within YouTube audiovisual content or the YouTube player without YouTube's prior written approval; or
sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page or screen that contains
YouTube API Data
unless other data, content, or material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and offers enough independent value to justify such sales if the
YouTube API Data
were removed.
Permitted Actions
All of the following commercial use cases are permitted subject to your and Your
API Clients
’ compliance with all other terms of the
Agreement
, including the prohibited actions detailed in the previous section:
Selling an API Client;
Promoting your own business or artistic enterprise by uploading original audiovisual content to YouTube or maintaining channel(s) on YouTube;
Developing ad-enabled
API Clients
, such as an ad-enabled blog or website, that use
YouTube API Services
subject to compliance with all other terms of the Agreement, including the restrictions in section III.G.1.d;
Placing your own branding in an
API Client
as long as that branding complies with the
YouTube Branding Guidelines
and does not interfere with YouTube audiovisual content playback or any
YouTube Brand Features
;
Selling or distributing devices that contain or run an API Client;
H. Monitoring and Audits
YouTube reserves the right to survey, monitor, and/or audit your access to or use of
YouTube API Services
to ensure quality, to improve YouTube products and services, and to verify your compliance with the
Agreement
. To that end, YouTube may survey users of your
API Clients
.
You and those acting on your behalf must:
not interfere with such surveys, monitoring efforts, or audits;
not obscure or conceal from YouTube your access to or use of
YouTube API Services
; and
upon request, and within the timeframe stated in that request, provide YouTube with account(s) necessary to access all features or functions of the current, in-production version(s) of your
API Clients
, so that YouTube may review those
API Clients
for compliance with the
Agreement
.
YouTube may use any technical means to overcome non-compliance with these provisions.
I. Additional Prohibitions
The policies in this section identify additional things that
API Clients
must not do. Actions contrary to these policies would be harmful to YouTube, to the YouTube community as a whole, or to individuals or groups of individuals within that community. These policies focus on the need for you and your
API Clients
to treat members of the YouTube community honestly and respectfully as well as on your need to respect the integrity of YouTube's services, content, and interests.
You and your
API Clients
must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to:
use
YouTube API Services
to create, offer, or act as a substitute for, or substantially similar service to, any
YouTube Applications
.
API Clients
must not mimic or replicate YouTube's core user experiences by recreating features or process flows unless they add significant independent value or functionality that improves users' interactions with YouTube. For example, an
API Client
must not recreate the browse experience from any YouTube Application without adding significant independent value to that flow.
misuse
YouTube API Services
or engage in abusive behaviors related to those Services. For example, you must not automate or trigger views, uploads, comments, likes, dislikes, or other actions without the user's prior specific and express consent;
interfere, or attempt to interfere, in any way with the proper workings of any aspect of
YouTube API Services
,
YouTube Applications
, or
Google Applications
, including interference or disruption of the servers or networks that provide those Services or Applications;
modify, interfere with, replace, or otherwise disable any functionality, data, or content made available as part of, or in connection with,
YouTube API Services
. For example, you must not remove, obscure, alter, or disable any links that appear in YouTube players or in
API Data
.
modify, interfere with, replace, or block advertisements placed or served by YouTube or by
YouTube API Services
including in
API Data
, YouTube audiovisual content, or YouTube players;
modify, build upon, or block any portion or functionality of a YouTube player;
separate, isolate, or modify the audio or video components of any YouTube audiovisual content made available as part of, or in connection with,
YouTube API Services
. For example, you must not apply alternate audio tracks to videos;
promote separately the audio or video components of any YouTube audiovisual content made available as part of, or in connection with, the
YouTube API Services
;
create, include, or promote features that play content, including audio or video components, from a background player, meaning a player that is not displayed in the page, tab, or screen that the user is viewing;
adversely affect the functionality or performance of any aspect of
YouTube API Services
,
YouTube Applications
, or
Google Applications
, including actions that interfere with or disrupt
YouTube API Services
or the servers or networks that provide those Services;
confuse, deceive, defraud, mislead, misrepresent, defame, abuse, stalk, threaten, spam, surprise, or harass anyone;
introduce, or attempt to introduce, any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, spyware, adware, or other items of a destructive nature to
YouTube API Services
,
YouTube Applications
,
Google Applications
, or YouTube users and the devices they use to access those services and properties;
circumvent, interfere with, or render ineffective, any geographical restrictions, including IP address-based restrictions imposed by YouTube or
YouTube API Services
;
use any technology other than
YouTube API Services
to access or retrieve
API Data
, including to access any portion of any YouTube audiovisual content;
offer an API service that allows users to access any data or functionality directly or indirectly provided by the
YouTube API Services
;
modify, translate, create derivative works of, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to extract the underlying source code from any
YouTube API Services
or from any software related to those Services;
use
YouTube API Services
for any purpose or activity where the use or failure of those Services could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control systems, or life support systems;
infringe copyrights or exploit copyright-infringing materials;
engage in, promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling;
create, display, promote or facilitate disruptive commercial messages or advertisements; or
situate the YouTube player in a nested or hierarchical iframe lineage to circumvent YouTube policies or otherwise obfuscate the source of use.
J. Child-Directed API Clients
If your API Client (or any part thereof) targets or directs itself to children (as defined
      under applicable law(s) including the U.S. Children's Online Privacy (COPPA) and E.U.
      General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR))  (referred to herein as a
      "
Child-Directed API Client
"), you and your Child-Directed API Client must:
ensure that your Child-Directed API Client, including its access to and use of any
          YouTube API Services, is compliant with COPPA, GDPR, and any other applicable laws or
          regulations at all times;
notify Google of the child directed nature of your Child-Directed API Client using the
          tools provided in
here
.
          Each Child-Directed API Client notified to Google using such tools or otherwise is
          referred to herein as a "
Known Child-Directed API Client
"; and
not use personalized ads (including remarketing) to target past or current activity by
          any user of your Child-Directed API Client.
For You and Your Child-Directed API Client.
You and your Child-Directed API
          Client will not, and must not attempt to, take any YouTube API Services write-based
          actions to YouTube websites, applications, services or products via your Child-Directed
          API Client.
Notwithstanding Section III.D.1.c (API Credentials) above which requires exactly one (1)
API Project
for each
API Client
, you can upload
          your own videos to your own official YouTube channel(s) via the YouTube Data API Service
          (not via your Child-Directed API Client or anyone else’s API Client) by creating a new
          API Project ("
Upload Project
").
To upload your own videos to your own official YouTube channel(s) via YouTube Data
              API Service, you must (A) create one (1) new
API Project
using the
Google Developers Console
(
https://console.developers.google.com/
)
              (an "
Upload Project
") prior to uploading, (B) append
mfk110
as a
              prefix in the ID of your Upload Project, and (C) only upload from your
              non-Child-Directed API Client (not from your Child-Directed API Client or anyone
              else’s API Client); and
Only you can use the Upload Project, and the Upload Project must only be used to
              upload your own videos to your own official YouTube channel(s) via the YouTube Data
              API Service from your non-Child-Directed API Client (not from your Child-Directed
              API Client or anyone else’s API Client).  If you are uploading a Made for Kids video
              via the YouTube Data API Service from your non-Child-Directed API Client (not from
              your Child-Directed API Client or anyone else’s API Client), you must designate the
              YouTube Data API Service Made for Kids parameter as "true".  See here for more
              information on determining if content is
Made for Kids
.
For You and Users of Your Child-Directed API Client.
You and your Child-Directed
          API Client must not enable, encourage or require, users of your Child-Directed API Client
          to take YouTube API Services write-based actions (such as, but not limited to, uploading
          content, commenting and creating/sharing playlists). YouTube API Services write-based
          actions taken by users of Known Child-Directed API Clients will not be implemented on
          YouTube websites, applications, services and products. This means that, notwithstanding
Section 9.1
          (Required Notice) of the YouTube API Services Terms of Service
pursuant to which users
          of your API Client may upload content to their YouTube channels or your YouTube
          channel(s), uploads from users of Known Child-Directed API Clients will not be implemented
          on YouTube websites, applications, services and products.
You and your API Client’s access to, or use of, YouTube API Services can be suspended or
      terminated by YouTube for non-compliance with the YouTube API Services Terms of Service and
      Policies including non-compliance with this Section III.J.
K. Reporting Noncompliance
