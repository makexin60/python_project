Direct marketing actions, to our well-known customers, offering each one bespoke services and meeting their needs in order to refine the relationship with those clients.
‍
4. When do we request access to your data?
UbiRider collects your personal data only when absolutely necessary for the exclusive compliance of the legitimate purposes herein laid down, with all security measures required for the data processed. UbiRider will not use the data collected for other purposes than those aforementioned. UbiRider will request access to your data when you access our platforms, when you register at our app, when you fill questionnaires at our website or app and, finally, when you purchase our services.
The moment when we collect your personal data will vary according to several circumstances. We may collect your data:
4.1 When you create a user's account
To create a user’s account and profile, it is necessary to collect some personal data, whether you do it directly at our mobile platform or through a third party social network which you registered with.
4.2 When you use our services
We may collect personal data on your access and your use of our services, such as location, search history, travel information, IP address and future booked trips. Whenever UbiRider is responsible for issuing the transportation title, we will also collect payment data, namely, the payment method and all connected data required to conclude the purchase according to the payment method chosen.
Your data thus collected will not be processed for other purposes than those mentioned or, to purposes not compatible with the purposes for which the personal data are initially collected. UbiRider commits to the safety of the processing activities and to the privacy of each user’s data.
4.3 Suggestions and Complaints
If you contact us to send suggestions or complaints, it will be necessary to collect some of your personal data so we can communicate with you and solve the issue.
Regardless of the subject, we will have to keep your identification information and contact information in our database, so we can answer your complaint/suggestion.
However, if for the purpose of addressing your complaint/suggestion, a clarification with a mobility operator provider is deemed necessary, your data will be transferred to this third party.
4.4 Sending of newsletters
You can register to receive our newsletter at our website. In this case, and if you give your specific and unambiguous consent, your email will be processed for this purpose.

​Whatever the case is, the user will always be entitled to request an invoice with Tax ID Number.
‍
5. With whom do we share your personal data?
Your data will be kept by UbiRider, acting as a Controller.
However, in certain circumstances, and in order to provide our services, we have to share your personal data with the mobility services providers we work with or with the payment services providers.
Mobility services providers act as Controllers themselves so you should visit and read their own privacy policies. If UbiRider and one of these providers become Joint Controllers for any or some of the processing activities, a written agreement will be concluded between the parties reflecting, in a transparent manner, the purposes and means of the processing of your data, as well as the responsibilities of each party in the conservation of the data processed, always in compliance with data protection legislation in place.
The payment services providers act as Processors and guarantee full compliance with the laws and regulations related to Data Protection and Privacy.
You can confer all mobility operators to which UbiRider, S.A. may transmit your personal data and access the privacy policy of each one of them here (
Fertagus,
Trevo
,

).
Likewise, whenever the ticket is purchased directly from Ubirider the provision of our services implies transferring your data to the payment services providers.
You may consult the list of payment services providers Ubirider may transfer your personal data and access their own privacy policies here:

.
Besides the above mentioned cases, UbiRider may also resort to services provided by other companies, which may entail, at least partially, the treatment of your personal data. However, these entities will be judiciously selected by UbiRider. UbiRider commits to only work with entities that comply with the data protection laws and that offer, at least, the same level of protection that Ubirider does.
Finally, UbiRider may be required to share your personal data with other entities in order to comply with legal obligations.
​
6. Where is my personal data stored?
The personal data that you provide UbiRider with will be stored at servers located within the European Union. If necessary, and according to the terms of the services agreed upon, the processors may transfer your data to servers located in third countries, that offer the same level of protection, as that in force in EU member-state entities or that demonstrate an adequate level of protection.
UbiRider uses Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL (AWS) services, based at 38 Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg and Google Cloud EMEA Limited services, based at Clanwilliam Place, Dublin 2, Ireland, specifically Firebase services.
The data transferred to these processors, taking into account UbiRider's headquarters, will be, by default, stored on servers located in the European Economic Area. Such data shall be subject to adequate security measures, under the terms of the agreements for the processing of personal data proposed by these services providers which, by contracting the services, UbiRider has accepted.
Furthermore, if necessary, AWS may occasionally and temporarily transfer this data to a third country. Google Firebase services reserves the right to carry out such transfers without justification. The selection of the recipient countries, in accordance with the commitments made in their respective policies, terms and agreements, will always be carefully considered and will fall upon countries that offer adequate guarantees for the processing of this personal data.
Without prejudice, both offer alternative mechanisms to provide adequate safeguards, namely the standard contractual clauses applicable to the transfer of personal data to third countries under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, adopted as an annex to Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021.

7. How long do we store your personal data?
UbiRider, S.A. will retain your personal for as long as necessary for the purposes mentioned or, where applicable, for the period required by law. Retention periods vary depending on the type of data processed and its purposes, and are defined on a case-by-case basis.
As soon as the reason for collecting the data ceases, if the data is no longer necessary for the establishment, exercise or the defense of legal claims and there is no legal obligation to keep the data, the data will be anonymised or deleted in a secure manner.
​​
8. Are your data processed securely?
UbiRider is concerned with the security of the personal data it processes and implements appropriate technical, organisational, and administrative security measures to protect the data stored, including against loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Once the purpose that justified the collection of your date ceases to apply, and provided the data is no longer necessary for the defence of any legal right of UbiRider or a third party, or if there is no legal obligation to retain the data, your data will be securely deleted or anonymised.

If necessary, and according to the terms of the services agreed upon, the processors may transfer your data to servers located in third countries, that offer the same level of protection, as that in force in EU member-state entities or that demonstrate an adequate level of protection.
UbiRider uses Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL (AWS) services, based at 38 Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg and Google Cloud EMEA Limited services, based at Clanwilliam Place, Dublin 2, Ireland, specifically Firebase services.
The data transferred to these processors, taking into account UbiRider's headquarters, will be, by default, stored on servers located in the European Economic Area. Such data shall be subject to adequate security measures, under the terms of the agreements for the processing of personal data proposed by these services providers which, by contracting the services, UbiRider has accepted.
Furthermore, if necessary, AWS may occasionally and temporarily transfer this data to a third country. Google Firebase services reserves the right to carry out such transfers without justification. The selection of the recipient countries, in accordance with the commitments made in their respective policies, terms and agreements, will always be carefully considered and will fall upon countries that offer adequate guarantees for the processing of this personal data.
Without prejudice, both offer alternative mechanisms to provide adequate safeguards, namely the standard contractual clauses applicable to the transfer of personal data to third countries under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, adopted as an annex to Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021.

7. How long do we store your personal data?
UbiRider, S.A. will retain your personal for as long as necessary for the purposes mentioned or, where applicable, for the period required by law. Retention periods vary depending on the type of data processed and its purposes, and are defined on a case-by-case basis.
As soon as the reason for collecting the data ceases, if the data is no longer necessary for the establishment, exercise or the defense of legal claims and there is no legal obligation to keep the data, the data will be anonymised or deleted in a secure manner.
​​
8. Are your data processed securely?
UbiRider is concerned with the security of the personal data it processes and implements appropriate technical, organisational, and administrative security measures to protect the data stored, including against loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Once the purpose that justified the collection of your date ceases to apply, and provided the data is no longer necessary for the defence of any legal right of UbiRider or a third party, or if there is no legal obligation to retain the data, your data will be securely deleted or anonymised.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
