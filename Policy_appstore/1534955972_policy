Summary
We may transfer your Personal Data to recipients in other countries. Where we transfer Personal Data from the EEA / UK to a recipient outside the EEA / UK that is not in an Adequate Jurisdiction, we do so on the basis of appropriate transfer mechanisms.
Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your Personal Data within the Al Jazeera group, and to third parties as noted in Section (G) above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Notice. For this reason, we may transfer your Personal Data to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located.
If an exemption or derogation applies (e.g., where a transfer is necessary to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim) we may rely on that exemption or derogation, as appropriate. Where we transfer your Personal Data from the EEA to recipients located outside the EEA who are not in Adequate Jurisdictions, we do so on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses. Where we transfer your Personal Data from the UK to recipients located outside the UK who are not Adequate Jurisdictions, we do so on the basis of the International Data Transfer Agreement (or the corresponding addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses). You may request a copy of these transfer mechanisms using the contact details provided in Section (Q) below.
Please note that when you transfer any Personal Data directly to an Al Jazeera entity established outside the EEA or UK, we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Data. We will nevertheless Process your Personal Data, from the point at which we receive those data, in accordance with the provisions of this Notice.

Summary
We may transfer your Personal Data to recipients in other countries. Where we transfer Personal Data from the EEA / UK to a recipient outside the EEA / UK that is not in an Adequate Jurisdiction, we do so on the basis of appropriate transfer mechanisms.
Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your Personal Data within the Al Jazeera group, and to third parties as noted in Section (G) above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Notice. For this reason, we may transfer your Personal Data to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located.

Where we transfer your Personal Data from the EEA to recipients located outside the EEA who are not in Adequate Jurisdictions, we do so on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses.

You may request a copy of these transfer mechanisms using the contact details provided in Section (Q) below.
Please note that when you transfer any Personal Data directly to an Al Jazeera entity established outside the EEA or UK, we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Data.
